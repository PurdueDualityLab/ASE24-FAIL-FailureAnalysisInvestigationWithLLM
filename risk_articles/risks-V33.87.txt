Subject: Cal. Gov. vetoes autonomous trucking bill (TechCrunch)

Governor Gavin Newsom just vetoed a bill banning fully driverless AV trucks.

California governor vetoes bill to ban driverless AV trucks
Rebecca Bellan@rebeccabellan, 24 Sep 2023

  "California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill Friday that would have
  required a human safety operator to be present any time a self-driving
  truck operated on public roads in the state."

https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB316/id/2789644

I'm very concerned that the risks associated with driverless trucks have not
been fully vetted, e.g.,Timothy McVeigh.

For those of you who weren't born yet, Timothy McVeigh blew up the Alfred
P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168 people,
using a rental truck full of an improvised fertilizer bomb.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_McVeigh

It's not clear whether forcing AV's to also have human drivers
('featherbedders'?) would have stopped a McVeigh-type attack, but it would
have thrown up an additional barrier.

California (and most other states) have severe penalties for driving while
'impaired' -- e.g., under the influence of alcohol or marijuana. Truck
drivers have substantial additional requirements in training, licensing and
records keeping -- e.g., number of continuous hours on the roads, etc.

How do you even test an AI driver for `impairment'? Do you use a
`hackalyzer'?  Does the AI have to get out of the vehicle and walk a
straight line? Is AI impairment even decidable?

How does a patrol car even `pull over' an AV?

At least for the moment, AI's have no 4th and 5th amendment rights, so there
are no civil rights to violate when asking ``Ihre Papiere, bitte?'', but
apparently there are no mechanisms to actually check the credentials of AI
truck drivers before they enter the Yerba Buena Tunnel or the Holland
Tunnel?

Many tunnels don't want RV's with propane tanks, but zombie AV's are OK?

Starlink now offers high-speed Internet for vehicles, including trucks. Yet
Elon Musk was roundly criticized for prohibiting Ukraine's use of Starlink
for AV weapons. Perhaps Elon's worries about weaponized AV's shouldn't be
dismissed out of hand?

Elon Musk's refusal to have Starlink support Ukraine attack in Crimea raises
questions for Pentagon

  I hate to sound like a Luddite, but I don't think that these breathless AV
  aficionados have completely thought all of these risks through.

OpenAI Employee Discovers Eliza Effect, Gets Emotional

ChatGPT's new text-to-voice feature has one OpenAI's head of safety
systems feeling *heard & warm*, while other experiments with AI therapy have
been a disaster.

Designing a program in such a way that it can truly convince someone that
another human is on the other side of the screen has been a goal of AI
developers since the concept took its first steps toward reality. Research
company OpenAI recently announced that its flagship product ChatGPT would be
getting eyes, ears, and a voice in its quest to appear more human. Now, an
AI safety engineer at OpenAI says she got “quite emotional” after using the
chatbot’s voice mode to have an impromptu therapy session.""

Subject: Nigerian Hacktivists Are Taking on Big Oil (Lucas Laursen)

Lucas Laursen, *IEEE Spectrum*, 27 Sep 2023,
via ACM TechNews, 29 Sep 2023

A group of Nigerian hacker-activists aims to collect and share data to
increase public awareness of pollution caused by oil spills. The Media
Awareness and Justice Initiative (MAJI) is organizing a low-cost air
pollution monitoring network, and last year the group began installing
the first of 15 air quality sensors in and around the city of Port
Harcourt. The sensors monitor particulate matter, temperature,
humidity, and atmospheric pressure to test for air pollution and
hopefully determine its origin. MAJI has deployed two community
networks to provide Internet access. MAJI's Okoro Onyekachi said the
organization releases its data through a Web portal, radio, and social
and print media in the hope of having a greater impact on polluters.

Subject: New York Bans Facial Recognition in Schools (AP)

Carolyn Thompson, *Associated Press*, 27 Sep 2023,
via ACM TechNews, 29 Sep 2023

New York State has prohibited facial recognition in schools, following
last month's report by the state's Office of Information Technology
Services acknowledging that the risks of the technology's use may
outweigh its security benefits. The analysis cited facial
recognition's "potentially higher rate of false positives for people
of color, non-binary and transgender people, women, the elderly, and
children." The report added that biotechnology would not prevent
students from entering schools "unless an administrator or staff
member first noticed that the student was in crisis, had made some
sort of threat, or indicated in some other way that they could be a
threat to school security." Decisions on digital fingerprinting and
other biometric solutions are left up to local districts, per New York
Education Commissioner Betty Rosa's directive.

Subject: Re: Google accused of directing motorist to drive off collapsed bridge
 (Kruk, RISKS-33.86)

The obvious question to ask is what happens to a driver who *wasn't* using a
Google app and drove off the collapsed bridge and died? The only third party
who could be held responsible is the municipality that failed to block off
the access in a way that no car could get through.  And that would still
hold true regardless of what method of navigation the person was using. A
couple of large blocks of concrete would do the job.

Can't really fault Google here.
