Subject: Security of US nukes now an official secret (Robert Burns)

Robert Burns, AP Exclusive via WRAL, 3 Jul 2017

WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon has thrown a cloak of secrecy over assessments of
the safety and security of its nuclear weapons operations, a part of the
military with a history of periodic inspection failures and lapses in
morale.

Overall results of routine inspections at nuclear weapons bases, such as a
"pass-fail" grade, had previously been publicly available. They are now
off-limits. The change goes beyond the standard practice of withholding
detailed information on the inspections.

The stated reason for the change is to prevent adversaries from learning too
much about U.S. nuclear weapons vulnerabilities. Navy Capt. Greg Hicks,
spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the added layer of secrecy was
deemed necessary.

"We are comfortable with the secrecy," Hicks said Monday, adding that it
helps ensure that "as long as nuclear weapons exist, the U.S. will maintain
a safe, secure, and effective nuclear stockpile."

Critics question the lockdown of information.

"The whole thing smells bad," said Steven Aftergood, a government secrecy
expert with the Federation of American Scientists. "They're acting like they
have something to hide, and it's not national security secrets."

"I think the new policy fails to distinguish between protecting valid
secrets and shielding incompetence," he added. "Clearly, nuclear weapons
technology secrets should be protected. But negligence or misconduct in
handling nuclear weapons should not be insulated from public
accountability."

about the implications. The opening paragraph sounds like something out of
science fiction -- except that it's a demonstrated reality today:

  Within the next few years, billions of IoT devices will densely populate
  our cities. In this paper, we describe a new type of threat in which
  adjacent IoT devices will infect each other with a worm that will rapidly
  spread over large areas, provided that the density of compatible IoT

Sheera Frenkel, *The New York Times*, Business Day, 3 Jul 2017

Subcaption: Hackers target developing countries to hone their skills with
malware that learns as it intrudes.

  Allan Liska [senior threat intelligence analyst] said, "We see a pattern
  among the attackers.  They test something, make improvements, and then six
  weeks later test again before launching it at their true targets."

  Chris Rock [Australian security researcher] said, "Doing tests in a
  country that presumably has fewer defenses is a double-edged sword.  On
  one hand, attackers can hone their skills.  On the other hand, they risk
  being discovered.  Once a cybersecurity firm has the signature of an
  attack, it can build defenses against it, and spread those defenses among
  its clients."

Subject: Researchers Found They Could Hack Entire Wind Farms

On a sunny day last summer, in the middle of a vast cornfield somewhere in
the large, windy middle of America, two researchers from the University of
Tulsa stepped into an oven-hot, elevator-sized chamber within the base of a
300-foot-tall wind turbine. They'd picked the simple pin-and-tumbler lock on
the turbine's metal door in less than a minute and opened the unsecured
server closet inside.

Jason Staggs, a tall 28-year-old Oklahoman, quickly unplugged a network
cable and inserted it into a Raspberry Pi minicomputer, the size of a deck
of cards, that had been fitted with a Wi-Fi antenna. He switched on the Pi
and attached another Ethernet cable from the minicomputer into an open port
on a programmable automation controller, a microwave-sized computer that
controlled the turbine. The two men then closed the door behind them and
walked back to the white van they'd driven down a gravel path that ran
through the field.

Staggs sat in the front seat and opened a MacBook Pro while the researchers
looked up at the towering machine. Like the dozens of other turbines in the
field, its white blades -- each longer than a wing of a Boeing 747 -- turned
hypnotically. Staggs typed into his laptop's command line and soon saw a
list of IP addresses representing every networked turbine in the field. A
few minutes later he typed another command, and the hackers watched as the
single turbine above them emitted a muted screech like the brakes of an
aging 18-wheel truck, slowed, and came to a stop.

State officials across the country responded to the commission's slapdash
request last week for detailed voter data in the manner previously reserved
for emailed pleas from a Nigerian prince.

Delete, said secretaries of state in Kentucky, Minnesota, Tennessee,
California -- more than 20 states refused to comply, red and blue and every
hue in between.  ``They can go jump in the Gulf of Mexico,'' Mississippi's
secretary of state, Delbert Hosemann, a Republican, responded.

What triggered the bipartisan backlash? A letter from the commission --
whose ostensible goal is to restore Americans' confidence in their elections
-- asked states to turn over by July 14 all publicly available information
about their voters, including names, addresses, dates of birth, political
party and voting history, criminal record, military status and the last four
digits of their Social Security number.

The Canadian TV Documentary Series Cyberwar has an international perspective
and often airs video recorded in Russia (beyond those places in Alaska) and
in other countries beyond the borders of Canada and the USA.

http://www.eyeoncanada.ca/television/details/cyberwar

One recent episode dealing with 2016 USA election meddling, pointed out that
the USA and probably other governments have been heavily involved in Russian
Election meddling since at least as far back as the 1996 election of
"western" favourite Boris Yeltsin. Pot, Kettle, Black as they say.

Points made by one of the USA folks interviewed was to identify the risk as
primarily a Russian Problem, not as a Digital Device or Network problem and
to distinguish between Retaliation and Response, since Response to a Russian
Problem can take a number of forms other than a cyber warfare or election
hack attempt against Russia or other meddlers.

It is a bad situation, but it is hard to claim the moral high ground when
your adversaries use computers and networks with effect, to do the same
thing you have both been doing for decades. If talking to someone seems like
looking in a mirror, and you don't like what you see, then perhaps it is
time to make some changes.

Russian Disinformation tactics go back a long time, as do similar campaigns
by other governments.

Subject: Republicans want to open U.S. roads for testing self-driving cars

One concern for Republicans: Lacking federal standards, 22 states have
imposed some sort of regulations, according to a tally by the National
Conference of State Legislatures, often in an attempt to address safety
concerns with a technology they believe is in its infancy.

To Walden and his GOP colleagues, the flurry of state-level activity marks a
break with a longstanding division of labor, one that sees the federal
government determining national safety and driver standards while leaving
only the logistics, like approving licenses, to the locals.

<OK, perhaps, but this too?>

Another Republican proposal would allow the government to designate as many
as 100,000 self-driving cars to be exempt from existing federal motor safety
rules, even though those guidelines — which govern everything from steering
wheels to airbags — were written many years before that technology existed.

 Your DreamHost VPS has just exceeded the memory allocation that you've

 Dear Dreamhost, thank you for these occasional reminders these months.

 -e -- $(date +\%M); COLUMNS=500 top -b -n 1 -c > TOP.${1#[0-9]}; fi
 # Yes, need to run once a minute, as Dreamhost takes no snapshots of
 # the system before rebooting it.

 Well you will never guess what the culprit is!:

Here's a crazy idea: why don't the tech firms do their *own* code reviews
and find the vulnerabilities themselves, before the Russians get to see the
source code?

An even better approach would be to use formal methods to develop
provably-correct code in the first place: this would be guaranteed

I assume that to be the real reason. For instance if you're using Java and
its standard way of parsing a date using a template like mm/dd/yy, there are
specific rules how that's actually interpreted:

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html#year

| For parsing with the abbreviated year pattern ("y" or "yy"), SimpleDateFormat
|  must interpret the abbreviated year relative to some century. It does this
|  by adjusting dates to be within 80 years before and 20 years after the time

|  string "01/11/12" would be interpreted as Jan 11, 2012 while the string
|  "05/04/64" would be interpreted as May 4, 1964.

06/29/25 falls into the 20-years-after-current-date rule.

I'm not sure if there was a Java-program being involved but I assume that
other languages provide similar ways of date-parsing mechanisms and should
use similar rules when parsing two-digit years.

The whole thing happened because of multiple failures:

  - The program parsing the date didn't check if the resulting date
    after the parsing is in the past and if not fail with an error
    and demand a full year specification or assume it to be a year of
    the last century and subtract 100 years from it.
  - The alert-processing side obviously didn't do any checks, either
    since it reacted to an earthquake that is still due for 8 years.
