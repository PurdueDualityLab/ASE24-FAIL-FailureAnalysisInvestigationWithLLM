Microsoft seeks to disrupt Russian criminal botnet it fears could seek to

MS won a court order to seize servers used by the Trickbot botnet, a network

voter-registration systems.

A federal judge on Sunday night left in place Georgia's new $108 million
touch-screen voting system, rejecting a call by election-integrity
advocates to switch to handwritten paper ballots hours before Georgians
flooded polling sites for the first day of early voting.

At least one local official in Atlanta reported technical glitches, similar
to problems that plagued the machines during primaries earlier this year.

Joseph Menn and Chris Bing, Reuters, 12 Oct 2020
via ACM TechNews, 14 Oct 2020

Microsoft on Monday said it had seized via federal court order Internet
Protocol (IP) addresses that had been directing activity on computers
infected with Trickbot malware. Microsoft warned that Trickbot has infected
a number of public government agencies, which could suffer worse damage if
the operators encrypt files or install programs that interfere with voter
registration records or the display and public disclosure of election
results. Microsoft worked with companies including security firm ESET to
disassemble Trickbot installations and trace them to their command IP
addresses, and invoked copyright law to secure the court order. Said
Microsoft's Tom Burt, "Ransomware is one of the largest threats to the
upcoming election."

Subject: Campaigns sidestep Cambridge Analytica crackdown with new methods
  (AFP)

"Your early vote has not been recorded," one text message said, with a link
for more information.

Other messages tell voters they are not registered, or offer unverified
information about a political opponent.

Fraudulent messages like these are drawing attention as political campaigns
ramp up data collection and voter targeting using their own technology to
circumvent restrictions imposed by social media platforms following the
Cambridge Analytica scandal.

Facebook barred apps which scraped data on users and their contacts after
revelations about the now-defunct British consulting group. But in
response, President Donald Trump's campaign and some activist groups are
using their own methods.

"What we are seeing is almost more potent than in 2016," said Samuel
Woolley, a University of Texas professor who leads propaganda research at
the school's Center for Media Engagement

Woolley's team, which examined messages such as the above-referenced ones,
found that the Trump mobile app, and to a lesser extent those of Democrat
Joe Biden and other political activist groups, scoop up data to create
profiles to craft personalized, targeted messages by SMS, email or social
media.  [...]

Subject: A different way the news is dividing America (yahoo!)

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-different-way-the-news-is-dividing-america-113945965.html

The 'information haves' subscribe to be informed: they can afford it, and
possess the luxurious volition to ignore or believe the published content.

The 'information have-nots' have no choice. They are routinely
under-informed or misinformed by "pink slime news:" freely accessible robot
news sources or scripted news services that promote divisive propaganda
designed to mislead and compel conflict.

"Pink slime journalism is at its core about two things; getting clicks for a
quick buck, or furthering a political agenda -- often the far-right or
foreign state actors, such as the Russians. In many cases these factors are
conflated into a foul, bubbling cauldron of propaganda, salaciousness and
lies."

"Think about the people who pay for the New York Times (NYT) (6.5 million
digital subscribers), the Wall Street Journal, (2.2 million), the Washington
Post, (2 million), the FT (750,000) etc. -- and the people who, well,
don't. 'Redlining news and information is basically saying lower
socioeconomic households won’t have access because they are unwilling or
unable to pay for information and therefore relegated to a poor news diet,'
says Victor Pickard, professor at the Annenberg School of Communication at
the University of Pennsylvania and author of 'Democracy without Journalism?
Confronting the Misinformation Society' 'It's very dangerous for a
democratic society.'"

Information source redlining reinforces economic dislocation. How can a
society's citizens become globally competitive when so many are denied
affordable or free access to viable and foundational information sources?
These sources help guide daily and long-term decisions governing their
personal health, economic welfare, or loyalty?

The "pink slime information" publication problem appears intractable to
resolve given short-term economic incentives that promote circulation.
These incentives outweigh priorities that government institutions and
programs established to benefit education, and create a functional
democracy.

That citizens of a democracy cannot afford to access viable and factual
information seems unconstitutional, a textbook case of big-tech capitalism
on overdrive (see
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/big-tech-out-of-control-capitalism-and-the-end-of-civilization/
retrieved on 11OCT2020 by John Horgan).

Suppose there was an legally enforceable tax on pink slime information
publication. The hypothetical "Pink Slime Information Taxation Act"
authorizes government revenue collection from "pink slime publication"
platforms. The taxes subsidizes public education: school districts receive
grants and vouchers that enable students (and families) to access certified
"non-pink slime" information sources.

Does democracy's long-term survival depend on The Pink Slime Information
Detector (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it)? It
might be only a few keystrokes away from open source release. The "Daily
Planet" headline from 04OCT2027 says it all: "Literature Nobel Prize Winner:
Pink Slime Taxes Taught Me To Write."

Subject: Inside the strange new world of being a deepfake actor
  (MIT Tech Review)

*There's an art to being a performer whose face will never be seen.*

In 2019, two multimedia artists, Francesca Panetta and Halsey Burgund, set
about to pursue a provocative idea. Deepfake video and audio had been
advancing in parallel but had yet to be integrated into a complete
experience. Could they do it in a way that demonstrated the technology's
full potential while educating people about how it could be abused?

To bring the experiment to life, they chose an equally provocative subject:
they would create an *alternative history of the 1969 Apollo moon landing*
<https://moondisaster.org/>. Before the launch, US president Richard
Nixon's speechwriters had prepared two versions of his national address -- one
designated ``*In Event of Moon Disaster*
<https://www.archives.gov/files/presidential-libraries/events/centennials/nixon/images/exhibit/rn100-6-1-2.pdf>,''
in case things didn't go as planned. The real Nixon, fortunately, never had
to deliver it. But a deepfake Nixon could.

So Panetta, the creative director at MIT's Center for Virtuality, and
Burgund, a fellow at the MIT Open Documentary Lab, partnered up with two AI
companies. *Canny AI* <https://www.cannyai.com/> would handle the deepfake
video, and *Respeecher* <https://www.respeecher.com/> would prepare the
deepfake audio. With all the technical components in place, they just
needed one last thing: an actor who would supply the performance.

``We needed to find somebody who was willing to do this, because it's a
little bit of a weird ask,'' Burgund says. ``Somebody who was more flexible
in their thinking about what an actor is and does.''

While deepfakes have now been around for a number of years, deepfake casting
and acting are relatively new. Early deepfake technologies weren't very
good, used primarily in dark corners of the Internet to swap celebrities
into porn videos without their consent. But as deepfakes have grown
increasingly realistic, more and more artists and filmmakers have begun
using them in broadcast-quality productions and TV ads. This means hiring
real actors for one aspect of the performance or another. Some jobs require
an actor to provide `base' footage; others need a voice.

For actors, it opens up exciting creative and professional possibilities.
But it also raises a host of ethical questions. ``This is so new that
there's no real process or anything like that,'' Burgund says. ``I mean, we
were just sort of making things up and flailing about.''  ``Want to become
Nixon?''  [...]

Subject: From a small town in North Carolina to big-city hospitals, how
  software infuses racism into U.S. health care (Casey Ross)

Casey Ross, StatNews, 13 Oct 2020
https://www.statnews.com/2020/10/13/how-software-infuses-racism-into-us-health-care/

  A STAT investigation found that a common method of using analytics
  software to target medical services to patients who need them most is
  infusing racial bias into decision-making about who should receive
  stepped-up care.  While a study published last year documented bias in the
  use of an algorithm in one health system, STAT found the problems arise
  from multiple algorithms used in hospitals across the country. The bias is
  not intentional, but it reinforces deeply rooted inequities in the
  American health care system, effectively walling off low-income Black and
  Hispanic patients from services that less sick white patients routinely
  receive.

Subject: Split-Second `Phantom' Images Can Fool Tesla's Autopilot (WiReD)

*Researchers found they could stop a Tesla by flashing a few frames of a
stop sign for less than half a second on an Internet-connected billboard.*

SAFETY CONCERNS OVER automated driver-assistance systems like Tesla's
usually focus on what the car can't see, like the white side of a truck that
one Tesla confused with a bright sky in 2016, leading to the death of a
driver.
<https://www.wired.com/2016/06/teslas-autopilot-first-deadly-crash/>  But one
group of researchers has been focused on what autonomous driving systems
might see that a human driver doesn't -- including "phantom" objects and
signs that aren't really there, which could wreak havoc on the road.

Researchers at Israel's Ben Gurion University of the Negev have spent the
last two years experimenting with those "phantom" images to trick
semi-autonomous driving systems <https://www.nassiben.com/phantoms>. They
previously revealed that they could use split-second light projections on
roads to successfully trick Tesla's driver-assistance systems into
automatically stopping without warning when its camera sees spoofed images
of road signs or pedestrians. In new research, they've found they can pull
off the same trick with just a few frames of a road sign injected on a
billboard's video. And they warn that if hackers hijacked an
Internet-connected billboard to carry out the trick, it could be used to
cause traffic jams or even road accidents while leaving little evidence
behind.

"The attacker just shines an image of something on the road or injects a
few frames into a digital billboard, and the car will apply the brakes or
possibly swerve, and that's dangerous," says Yisroel Mirsky, a researcher
for Ben Gurion University and Georgia Tech who worked on the research,
which will be presented next month at the ACM Computer and Communications
Security conference. "The driver won't even notice at all. So somebody's
car will just react, and they won't understand why."

In their first round of research, published earlier this year
<https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/01/how-a-300-projector-can-fool-teslas-autopilot/>,
the team projected images of human figures onto a road, as well as road
signs onto trees and other surfaces. They found that at night, when the
projections were visible, they could fool both a Tesla Model X running the
HW2.5 Autopilot driver-assistance system -- the most recent version available
at the time, now the second-most-recent  -- and a Mobileye 630 device. They
managed to make a Tesla stop for a phantom pedestrian that appeared for a
fraction of a second, and tricked the Mobileye device into communicating
the incorrect speed limit to the driver with a projected road sign.

In this latest set of experiments, the researchers injected frames of a
phantom stop sign on digital billboards, simulating what they describe as a
scenario in which someone hacked into a roadside billboard to alter its
video. They also upgraded to Tesla's most recent version of Autopilot known
as HW3. They found that they could again trick a Tesla or cause the same
Mobileye device to give the driver mistaken alerts with just a few frames
of altered video.  [...]

Subject: Car design about to change forever? (Fast Company)

Electric vehicles are incredible. Beyond eliminating fossil fuels, they are
whisper quiet, accelerate faster than gasoline cars, and according to *a new
Consumer Reports study*
<https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/10/owning-an-electric-car-really-does-save-money-consumer-reports-finds/>,
operate with less expensive maintenance over time. But one of the biggest
benefits of EVs that they are *revolutionizing*
<https://www.fastcompany.com/90534847/why-the-car-of-the-future-is-more-like-a-lego-set-than-a-bond-ride>
the way cars are built.

How? As this new video from Israeli startup Ree demonstrates, the EV of
tomorrow is basically just a giant skateboard. With tiny motors placed
inside the wheels, the car can assume any form imaginable; any sort of
seating or storage arrangement can be built right on top of this flat base.

Traditional gas cars were built atop a flat chassis, too. But that chassis
was hardly so self contained. Components like your engine and steering
system are on top. Then the motor propels a complex series of axles under
the car. Of course you have brakes, suspension, cooling systems, gas lines,
and other systems to snake around, too. It all adds up to *30,000 parts*
<https://www.toyota.co.jp/en/kids/faq/d/01/04/#:~:text=A%20single%20car%20has%20about,materials%20and%20different%20manufacturing%20processes.>
which
are screwed, pressed, glued, and welded together. Today, most modern
manufacturing uses robots to frame out the entire car first like a
house -- from chassis to body -- meaning your car's floorpan is permanent from
its earliest moments on the assembly line.

Ree was one of our Most Innovative Companies of 2020, and it's one of
several manufacturers working on an alternative platform. Peers include
automotive mainstays like *VW*
<https://www.ft.com/content/a2b8cf3a-1e14-11e9-b126-46fc3ad87c65>, newer
startups like *Rivian*
<https://www.fastcompany.com/90406937/amazon-plans-to-have-100000-electric-delivery-vans-on-the-road-by-2030>,
and even *Tesla*
<https://cleantechnica.com/2020/06/19/history-of-electric-cars-using-skateboard-platforms/>.
But Ree's new video, seen here, is the first time I've witnessed the odd
spectacle of these flat chassis whipping around a track with no other
filigree attached.  [...]

Subject: Fifth of countries at risk of ecosystem collapse, analysis finds
  ()

Trillions of dollars of GDP depend on biodiversity, according to Swiss
report

One-fifth of the world's countries are at risk of their ecosystems
collapsing because of the destruction of wildlife and their habitats,
according to an analysis by the insurance firm Swiss Re.

Natural services such as food, clean water and air, and flood protection
have already been damaged by human activity.

More than half of global GDP -- $42tn - depends on high-functioning
biodiversity, according to the report, but the risk of tipping points is
growing.

Countries including Australia, Israel and South Africa rank near the top of
Swiss Re's index of risk to biodiversity and ecosystem services, with
India, Spain and Belgium also highlighted. Countries with fragile
ecosystems and large farming sectors, such as Pakistan and Nigeria, are
also flagged up.

Countries including Brazil and Indonesia had large areas of intact
ecosystems but had a strong economic dependence on natural resources, which
showed the importance of protecting their wild places, Swiss Re said.

``CA staggering fifth of countries globally are at risk of their ecosystems
collapsing due to a decline in biodiversity and related beneficial
services,'' said Swiss Re, one of the world's biggest reinsurers and a
linchpin of the global insurance industry.

``If the ecosystem service decline goes on [in countries at risk], you would
see then scarcities unfolding even more strongly, up to tipping points,''
said Oliver Schelske, lead author of the research.

Jeffrey Bohn, Swiss Re's chief research officer, said: ``This is the first
index to our knowledge that pulls together indicators of biodiversity and
ecosystems to cross-compare around the world, and then specifically link
back to the economies of those locations.''

The index was designed to help insurers assess ecosystem risks when setting
premiums for businesses but Bohn said it could have a wider use as it
``allows businesses and governments to factor biodiversity and ecosystems
into their economic decision-making.''

The UN revealed in September that the world's governments failed to meet a
single target to stem biodiversity losses in the last decade, while leading
scientists warned in 2019 that humans were in jeopardy from the
accelerating decline of the Earth's natural life-support systems. More than
60 national leaders recently pledged to end the destruction.

The Swiss Re index is built on 10 key ecosystem services identified by the
world's scientists and uses scientific data to map the state of these
services at a resolution of one square kilometre across the world's land.
The services include provision of clean water and air, food, timber,
pollination, fertile soil, erosion control, and coastal protection, as well
as a measure of habitat intactness.

Those countries with more than 30% of their area found to have fragile
ecosystems were deemed to be at risk of those ecosystems collapsing. Just
one in seven countries had intact ecosystems covering more than 30% of
their country area.

Among the G20 leading economies, South Africa and Australia were seen as
being most at risk, with China 7th, the US 9th and the UK 16th.

Alexander Pfaff, a professor of public policy, economics and environment at
Duke University in the US, said: ``Societies, from local to global, can do
much better when we not only acknowledge the importance of contributions
from nature -- as this index is doing -- but also take that into account in
our actions, private and public.''  [...]

Subject: SpaceX Is Building a Military Rocket to Ship Weapons Anywhere in
  the World in 1 hour (Business Insider)

Fresh Delivery

SpaceX and the Pentagon just signed a contract to jointly develop a new
rocket that can launch into space and deliver up to 80 tons of cargo and
weaponry anywhere in the world  --  in just one hour.

Tests on the rocket are expected to begin as early as next year, *Business
Insider
<https://www.businessinsider.com/musks-spacex-partners-us-military-to-deliver-weapons-by-rockets-2020-10>reports
<https://www.businessinsider.com/musks-spacex-partners-us-military-to-deliver-weapons-by-rockets-2020-10>*.
It's expected to shuttle weapons around the world 15 times faster than
existing aircraft, like the US C-17 Globemaster.

``Think about moving the equivalent of a C-17 payload anywhere on the globe
in less than an hour,'' General Stephen Lyons, head of US Transportation
Command said at a Wednesday conference
<https://www.ndtahq.com/events/fall-meeting/>.  Military Contractor

The new contract is further evidence that SpaceX is leaning hard into
military partnerships. Earlier this week, the private space company won a
contract with the military's Space Development Agency to *manufacture four
missile-tracking satellites*.
<https://futurism.com/the-byte/pentagon-commissioned-spacex-build-missile-tracking-satellites>

Prior to that, the *Army approached SpaceX*
<https://futurism.com/the-byte/us-military-access-spacex-satellite-constellation>
about turning its constellation of Starlink broadband satellites into a new
military navigation network, and Space Force officials let slip earlier this
year that they were *already working closely*
<https://futurism.com/the-byte/space-force-elon-musk> with SpaceX after
awarding the company a contract *in August*, *BI* reports.  History Rhymes
<https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-wins-space-force-rocket-launch-nssl-agreement-40-percent-2020-8>

The new weapon delivery system resembles a militarized version of something
that SpaceX CEO proposed *back in 2017*
<https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/28/spacex-plans-to-use-spaceships-for-earth-passenger-transit/>,

[https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/09/hacking-a-coffee-maker.html]
As expected, IoT devices are filled with vulnerabilities
[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/09/how-a-hacker-turned-a-250-coffee-maker-into-ransom-machine/]:

As a thought experiment, Martin Hron, a researcher at security company Avast
reverse-engineered one of the older coffee makers to see what kinds of hacks
he could do with it. After just a week of effort, the unqualified answer
was: quite a lot. Specifically, he could trigger the coffee maker to turn on
the burner, dispense water, spin the bean grinder, and display a ransom
message, all while beeping repeatedly. Oh, and by the way, the only way to
stop the chaos was to unplug the power cord.  [...]

In any event, Hron said the ransom attack is just the beginning of what an
attacker could do. With more work, he believes, an attacker could program a
coffee maker -- and possibly other appliances made by Smarter -- to attack
the router, computers, or other devices connected to the same network. And
the attacker could probably do it with no overt sign anything was amiss.

Subject: Apple's T2 security chip has an unfixable flaw (Lily Hay Newman)

Checkm8 vulnerability used to jailbreak iPhones hits Macs as well.

by Lily Hay Newman, wired.com
Oct 10, 2020

A recently released tool is letting anyone exploit an unusual Mac vulnerability to bypass Apple's trusted T2 security chip and gain deep system access. The flaw is one researchers have also been using for more than a year to jailbreak older models of iPhones. But the fact that the T2 chip is vulnerable in the same way creates a new host of potential threats. Worst of all, while Apple may be able to slow down potential hackers, the flaw is ultimately unfixable in every Mac that has a T2 inside.

In general, the jailbreak community hasn't paid as much attention to macOS
and OS X as it has iOS, because they don't have the same restrictions and
walled gardens that are built into Apple's mobile ecosystem. But the T2
chip, launched in 2017, created some limitations and mysteries. Apple added
the chip as a trusted mechanism for securing high-value features like
encrypted data storage, Touch ID, and Activation Lock, which works with
Apple's "Find My" services. But the T2 also contains a vulnerability, known
as Checkm8, that jailbreakers have already been exploiting in Apple's A5
through A11 (2011 to 2017) mobile chipsets. Now Checkra1n, the same group
that developed the tool for iOS, has released support for T2 bypass.  [...]

Subject: International Statement: End-To-End Encryption and Public Safety
  (DoJ)

Department of Justice
Office of Public Affairs
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Sunday, October 11, 2020
International Statement: End-To-End Encryption and Public Safety

We, the undersigned, support strong encryption, which plays a crucial role
in protecting personal data, privacy, intellectual property, trade secrets
and cyber security.  It also serves a vital purpose in repressive states to
protect journalists, human rights defenders and other vulnerable people, as
stated in the 2017 resolution of the UN Human Rights Council[1]
<https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-statement-end-end-encryption-and-public-safety# ftn1>.
Encryption is an existential anchor of trust in the digital world and we do
not support counter-productive and dangerous approaches that would
materially weaken or limit security systems.

Particular implementations of encryption technology, however, pose
significant challenges to public safety, including to highly vulnerable
members of our societies like sexually exploited children. We urge industry
to address our serious concerns where encryption is applied in a way that
wholly precludes any legal access to content.  We call on technology
companies to work with governments to take the following steps, focused on
reasonable, technically feasible solutions:

   - Embed the safety of the public in system designs, thereby enabling
   companies to act against illegal content and activity effectively with no
   reduction to safety, and facilitating the investigation and prosecution of
   offences and safeguarding the vulnerable;
   - Enable law enforcement access to content in a readable and usable
   format where an authorisation is lawfully issued, is necessary and
   proportionate, and is subject to strong safeguards and oversight; and
   - Engage in consultation with governments and other stakeholders to
   facilitate legal access in a way that is substantive and genuinely
   influences design decisions.

*IMPACT ON PUBLIC SAFETY*

Law enforcement has a responsibility to protect citizens by investigating
and prosecuting crime and safeguarding the vulnerable. Technology companies
also have responsibilities and put in place terms of service for their
users that provide them authority to act to protect the public.  End-to-end
encryption that precludes lawful access to the content of communications in
any circumstances directly impacts these responsibilities, creating severe
risks to public safety in two ways:

   1. By severely undermining a company's own ability to identify and
   respond to violations of their terms of service. This includes responding
   to the most serious illegal content and activity on its platform, including
   child sexual exploitation and abuse, violent crime, terrorist propaganda
   and attack planning; and
   2. By precluding the ability of law enforcement agencies to access
   content in limited circumstances where necessary and proportionate to
   investigate serious crimes and protect national security, where there is
   lawful authority to do so.

Concern about these risks has been brought into sharp focus by proposals to
apply end-to-end encryption across major messaging services.  UNICEF
estimates that one in three internet users is a child.  The WePROTECT
Global Alliance -- a coalition of 98 countries, 39 of the largest companies
in the global technology industry, and 41 leading civil society
organisations -- set out clearly the severity of the risks posed to children
online by inaccessible encrypted services in its 2019 Global Threat
Assessment: ``Publicly-accessible social media and communications platforms
remain the most common methods for meeting and grooming children online. In
2018, Facebook Messenger was responsible for nearly 12 million of the
18.4 million worldwide reports of CSAM [child sexual abuse material to the
US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)]. These
reports risk disappearing if end-to-end encryption is implemented by
default, since current tools used to detect CSAM [child sexual abuse
material] do not work in end-to-end encrypted environments.'' [2]
<https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-statement-end-end-encryption-and-public-safety#_ftn2>
On 3 October 2019 NCMEC published a statement on this issue, stating that:
``If end-to-end encryption is implemented without a solution in place to
safeguard children, NCMEC estimates that more than half of its CyberTipline
reports will vanish.'' [3]
<https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-statement-end-end-encryption-and-public-safety#_ftn3>
And on 11 December 2019, the United States and European Union (EU) issued a
joint statement making clear that while encryption is important for
protecting cyber security and privacy: ``the use of warrant-proof encryption
by terrorists and other criminals =93 including those who engage in online
child sexual exploitation =93 compromises the ability of law enforcement
agencies to protect victims and the public at large.''[4]
<https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-statement-end-end-encryption-and-public-safety#_ftn4>

*RESPONSE*

In light of these threats, there is increasing consensus across governments
and international institutions that action must be taken: while encryption
is vital and privacy and cyber security must be protected, that should not
come at the expense of wholly precluding law enforcement, and the tech
industry itself, from being able to act against the most serious illegal
content and activity online.

In July 2019, the governments of the United Kingdom, United States,
Australia, New Zealand and Canada issued a communique, concluding that:
``tech companies should include mechanisms in the design of their encrypted
products and services whereby governments, acting with appropriate legal
authority, can gain access to data in a readable and usable format. Those
companies should also embed the safety of their users in their system
designs, enabling them to take action against illegal content.''[5]
<https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-statement-end-end-encryption-and-public-safety#_ftn5>
On 8 October 2019, the Council of the EU adopted its conclusions on
combating child sexual abuse, stating: ``The Council urges the industry to
ensure lawful access for law enforcement and other competent authorities to
digital evidence, including when encrypted or hosted on IT servers located
abroad, without prohibiting or weakening encryption and in full respect of
privacy and fair trial guarantees consistent with applicable law.''[6]
<https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-statement-end-end-encryption-and-public-safety#_ftn6>

The WePROTECT Global Alliance, NCMEC and a coalition of more than 100 child
protection organisations and experts from around the world have all called
for action to ensure that measures to increase privacy =93 including
end-to-end encryption =93 should not come at the expense of children's safety
[7]
<https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-statement-end-end-encryption-and-public-safety#_ftn7>
.

*CONCLUSION*

We are committed to working with industry to develop reasonable proposals
that will allow technology companies and governments to protect the public
and their privacy, defend cyber security and human rights and support
technological innovation.  While this statement focuses on the challenges
posed by end-to-end encryption, that commitment applies across the range of
encrypted services available, including device encryption, custom encrypted
applications and encryption across integrated platforms.  We reiterate that
data protection, respect for privacy and the importance of encryption as
technology changes and global Internet standards are developed remain at
the forefront of each state's legal framework.  However, we challenge the
assertion that public safety cannot be protected without compromising
privacy or cyber security.  We strongly believe that approaches protecting
each of these important values are possible and strive to work with
industry to collaborate on mutually agreeable solutions.

The National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2020, yields "Estimates of Diabetes
and Its Burden in the United States." The summary (pg. 3) states for
calendar year 2018:
https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pdfs/data/statistics/national-diabetes-statistics-report.pdf,

* 34.2 million people of all ages -- or 10.5% of the US population -- had
  diabetes.

* 34.1 million adults aged 18 years or older -- or 13.0% of all U.S.  adults
  -- had diabetes (Table 1a; Table 1b).

* 7.3 million adults aged 18 years or older who met laboratory criteria for
  diabetes were not aware of or did not report having diabetes (undiagnosed
  diabetes, Table 1b). This number represents 2.8% of all US adults (Table
  1a) and 21.4% of all US adults with diabetes.

Page 15 summarizes health care costs:

The total direct and indirect estimated costs of diagnosed diabetes in the
United States in 2017 was US$ 327B.

Invoking https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/search?query=glucose reveals 10
prior posts from AUG2005 through APR2020 that discuss device/system safety,
and document patient quality of life impact.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4667344/ (retrieved on
12OCT2020) summarizes continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and Insulin Dosing

study does not provide device deployment estimates per 100,000 population
diagnosed with diabetes.

https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/understanding-the-insulin-market/
(retrieved on 14OCT) indicates that 8.3M patients in the US require insulin
to treat a diabetic condition. Patient insulin dependence is likely to
determine CGM/ID device eligibility. Given the National Diabetes Report, the
number of deployed devices is likely large (greater than 100,000) with
anticipated growth.

Refer to

The FDA's Total Product Lifecycle (TPLC) reporting system collates device
problems for integrated glucose monitor and insulin dosing devices. There
are four FDA allocated product codes: QFG, OZQ, OZP and OZO categorizing
these devices for certification and reporting purposes.

This risks submission summarizes TPLC tabulations for devices assigned to
product codes OZO and OZP. These product codes appear to possess the highest
density of CGM/ID device problems and medical device reports (MDRs). MDRs
usually originate from patient-device interactions that yield injury,

Subject: Interview techniques and the "don't know" answer

While I'm not an expert on interviewing techniques, one of the pointers I do
know is that when you ask a subject about something they should know about,
and they have no idea or opinion, they are lying to you.  Or, at the very
least, trying to hide something.  For example, I am a security maven.  If
you were to ask me how I would go about breaking into something, I should
have at least half a dozen ideas to try, right off the top of my head.  If I
said I had no idea how I would approach breaking into whatever you were
interested in, it's probably a good bet that I am already well along in my
plan to actually break into it, and don't want to give the game away.

As another example, if you are questioning, say, a judge, about appointment
to a higher office, and you know that the judge under investigation clerked
for a higher court judge, and you ask the judge under investigation about
the higher court judges opinion that a case should have been decided
otherwise, and the judge under investigation says that [he or] she doesn't

either lying or completely incompetent, or trying, very seriously, to
mislead you, or avoid answering.  It's her job to have an opinion.  And it
wouldn't be off the top of her head: she worked with the higher court judge
and probably had something to do with writing the dissenting opinion.  It's
her job, it's her background, and there is no reason for her to avoid
answering the question, in great detail.

Subject: To my friends and colleagues in the U.S.: Be careful out there.

Oh, my colleagues and only friends, especially in the US--you are under
threat.  You are in danger.  You are at risk.  Please be careful.

Possibly it is because I put myself through uni working in a hospital and
even an isolation ward.  Perhaps it is because I just finished writing a
book on "Cybersecurity Lessons from CoVID-19."  I am, perhaps, more
sensitized to the topic, and I have, possibly, been keeping too close an eye
on the numbers.  But I suspect you may be heading for trouble.

Maybe not you, personally, but, maybe.  You, my colleagues and friends, are
professionals, and live and work in environments that are probably not at
greatest risk.  But infectious diseases do not pay attention to rent levels.
And possibly someone that you know and love is at greater risk.

I live in BC.  We've been very fortunate.  We were at high risk due to
levels of international travel, but we were randomly lucky in regard to
things like the dates of spring school vacation, and having the world's
greatest chief medical health officer.  March and April were really hard,
and then we seemed to get things under control.

But, in pandemics, things may not be as they "seem."  Recently we have had a
surge in cases in BC.  Every pandemic in history has had a second wave, and
generally worse than the first.  Unfortunately, there isn't a good pattern
for second waves, other than that they exist; and the only way to know when
you've had it is after it's over.  Our recent surge, in BC, may be our
second wave.  Or, our second wave may still be to come.  But four other
provinces in Canada have also had surges.  Europe is having a surge.  And,
despite having the highest rates both absolutely and per capita, there are
indications that the US may be heading for a surge as well.  The predictions
of 400,000 deaths by January may be conservative.

Everybody is tired of the pandemic.  And the fact that there is so much we
don't know about it makes it much harder to get people to pay attention.  We
do not like uncertainty.  We dislike it so much that when things are
uncertain we ignore them.  We have only known of the existence of this class
of virus for sixty years.  We have had only one experience with a disease
from this class of virus, and that was limited and short-lived.  This type
of virus defies our models of spread from better-known disease vectors.
Getting a disease from many viruses confers life- long protection, but this
one seems to be able to re-infect some people, sometimes within months.  We
are learning as we go, and it's hard to keep up.  And, unfortunately, as we
go, and as we learn, some people are dying, and others are getting very
sick.  Sometimes for a long time.

We are working on a vaccine.  At least 150 vaccines, in fact.  A handful are
under last stage trials.  Two of those trials have been halted, hopefully
temporarily, because of possible problems that have come to light during the
trials.  This is common, and it is the purpose of trials to find those
problems.  This time around it is making news only because people are so
desperate for the vaccines.

But, even when we find a vaccine (hopefully more than one), we then have to
manufacture (carefully, and with due attention to contamination) billions of
doses, and then figure out how everyone is going to get "shot."  Many people
are thinking we will have a vaccine by the beginning of the new year.  I
rather suspect that it will be June before enough people have been
vaccinated to provide real protection.

In the meantime, as Dr. Bonnie Henry has said, the future is in your hands,
and you must continue to wash them.  Strict isolation is not absolutely
necessary, and, as Poe pointed out in "The Masque of the Red Death," not
guaranteed.  Nothing, in fact, is guaranteed.  Defence in depth and layered
defence is mandatory.  Physical distancing is primary.  Keeping groups;
*all* groups, *all* meetings, *all* parties; small and to a minimum is
primary.  Washing your hands, constantly, is vital.  Wearing a mask, if you
must be in public or with others, is not magic and will not save you, but
reduces (not eliminates) the risk of close contact.  Follow the World Health
Organization's Five Heroic Acts.  (Speaking of the which, the integrity of
advice is not only changing, but is under attack.  Stick to the advice of
those who know what they are talking about.  Listen to experts like Bonnie
Henry or Fauci, not Barrington and his gang of homeopaths.)  Activities with
heavy breathing and in large groups, like contact sports or choirs, are very
dangerous.  (Orgies are *definitely* contraindicated.)

coronavirus/safehands-challenge/5-heroic-acts

Be kind.  Be calm.  Be safe.  Be careful.  This is not forever, but it is
for now.

Subject: Re: Why cars are more "fragile": more technology has reduced
  robustness (Robinson, RISKS-32.31)

A few years ago, a motoring journalist commented that there seems to be an
'unholy alliance' between governments and car makers; they want to show how
much they want to save our lives and save the planet so they add these
costly features for improved safety, fuel economy, and lower emissions.
Governments like this because it shows how caring and compassionate they
are, and car makers like this because it allows them to control the repair
business.  And making cars difficult to repair probably earns more tax $$$$s
for selling new ones.

One example that comes to mind is the power steering on my car, made in
1988, which uses the traditional hydraulic pump and steering box. Works
fine, but the slight snag is poor energy efficiency.  Modern cars use
electric power steering, with an electric motor and tons of complicated
electronics.  Much better energy efficiency as the assistance only works
when it's needed, *and* the amount of assistance can be varied to suit the
driver's taste (fingertip-light to sports car) with a dashboard control.
Downside is that it's (reportedly) not a repairable item, with replacements
(if still available) allegedly $1,000 or so + labour + cost of recalibrating
the computers.  The factory manual for my car gives instructions for
rebuilding the steering pump and box on my kitchen table (not that I'd
actually want to do this). The *real* reason for electric power steering is
that it can be integrated with the (mandated) braking-stability control,
which detects the steering-wheel angle and compares the actual car's turning
movement with a yaw sensor, then distributes the braking force accordingly
to reduce the chance of a skid.  That's apart from 'lane-assist' and similar
collision-avoidance features, of course.  Dunno how these things are checked
at vehicle inspection times ("MoT" in UK) -- presumably heavily dependent on
self-diagnostics?

As the original poster said, it's not clear what the future holds.  Many of
these 'fragile' features, like the CAN bus mentioned, are legal requirements
in a lot of countries so car buyers can't just choose to avoid them, and
it's likely that running older cars will become more difficult over time; I
believe that in mainland Europe there are often restrictions on using
'historic' vehicles, typically by selecting required days per year with a
scratch card.  Some British cities are proposing low-emission schemes and
reduction of traffic with varying degrees of aggression -- in London there's
the daily congestion charge for all vehicles in the central area, with a
hefty supplementary charge for those not meeting the latest emission
standards.

Subject: Re: Risks of Excel (RISKS-32.31)

Risk of Spreadsheets

In view of the recent RISKS entries about Excel, I was mildly amused to
learn that the Covid 19 Aerosol Transmission model recently published by the
Max Planck institute is an Excel spreadsheet.
https://www.mpic.de/4747065/risk-calculation For an academic paper Excel is
probably appropriate.

However after thinking a bit I was no longer amused.  I believe that many of
the (unpublished) models used by epidemiologists and policymakers probably
also use Excel spreadsheets.

There is a real risk of bad decisions resulting from errors in large
complicated spreadsheets, which could have serious consequences.

The other risk is that an application will in the future be used in an
application for which it was not intended and is not suitable.

  COVID-19 cases (RISKS-32.31)

The "dumbed-down" reports of this in British mainstream media, including that quoted by Thomas Dzubin, did not expose the basic issue ... which was that Public Health England (PHE) was apparently using Excel 2003 (or earlier).  Office 2003 went out of support in Spring 2014, but it was (reportedly) only in July this year that PHE identified a need to upgrade.

Thanks to Steve and everyone else who replied to my message.

As best I can determine, my problem started with the 'Catalina' MacOS
upgrade.  I never had a problem with the clock prior to this upgrade.

Apparently, the Catalina upgrade turned *off* automatic time sync'ing for
me, thus allowing a slow clock drift over a number of months which resulted
in a several minute discrepancy.

Thanks to several replies, I turned automatic time sync'ing back on,
and everything is working again.
