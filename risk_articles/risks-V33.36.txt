"Medical training in the robotics age leaves tomorrow's surgeons short on
skills."

"Once the robotic arms are in place and instruments are inserted, the
surgeon 'scrubs out' and takes up position perhaps 15 feet away from the
patient in the immersive daVinci control console, which provides a
stereoscopic view. The surgeon's hands are on two multipurpose controllers
that can move and rotate the instruments in all directions; by switching
between controllers, the surgeon's two hands can easily manage all four
robotic arms.

"And the trainee... well, the trainee gets to watch from another console, if
there is one. While the lead surgeon could theoretically give the trainee
one of the robot arms to control, in practice it never happens. And surgeons
are reluctant to give the trainee control over all the arms because they
know that will make the procedure take longer, and the risk to the patient
goes up nonlinearly with elapsed time under anesthesia."

Sawbone v. Robot patient outcome comparisons for certain procedures, such as
prostate surgery, are challenging to interpret. Why?

The FDA is required to collect and report data for adverse events. The
medical device reports (MDRs) document and standardize adverse event
resulting in patient injury, death, and device malfunction. MDRs are almost
exclusively prepared and reported by device manufacturer representatives:
significant subject matter expertise necessary to accurately document an
adverse event.

The FDA is NOT required to collect data on the total number of robotic
surgical procedures performed over time. The robot surgeon device
manufacturers know, but are not required to disclose.

This practice explains why most (if not all) long-term medical device
recipient studies reveal events per population (usually per 100,000) per
year. This data can be extracted from billing records kept at the Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services (cms.gov). Trend reporting can smooth and
obscure event clusters.

The total robot procedures performed, devices implanted/explanted or
in-service per year constitute "proprietary data." Expecting consumers to
interpolate medical device counts or surgical procedures by examining MDR
filings is burdensome.

Would a legal requirement for periodic manufacturer disclosure of aggregate
medical device implants/explants or procedure counts improve safety? MDRs
v. actual counts information may enlighten more than device per patient
population trends.

Refer to
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfTPLC/tplc.cfm?id=5692&min_report_year=2017
from FDA's TPLC platform for Product Code NAY: System, surgical, computer
controlled instrument. This product code groups several manufacturer devices
into equivalent categories. Intuitive Surgical, Inc.'s DaVinci is
prominently featured in the report.

The TPLC MDR summary shows robotic surgical device adverse event reports per
year. That total adverse event-report frequency grows year-over-year
suggests robotic-driven surgical procedures are in demand. In CSV format:

MDR Year MDR Reports MDR Events
  2017      1049      1049
  2018      1074      1074
  2019      1154      1154
  2020      1558      1558
  2021      1997      1997
  2022      2465      2465

"Break" or "Detachment of Device or Device Component" events characterize
the most common robot surgeon faults.

You may be hearing about this, and I'm not going to try critique it in
detail here right now. But I will express an overall opinion of it.  My
sense is that it is an unmitigated mess. Nor is it obvious to me that it
will ever not be an unmitigated mess. The list of reasons why is long and
technical. But that's my executive summary for right now based on what I've
seen about this to date. -L

Subject: Re: BMW's Heated as a Service Model Has Drivers Seeking Hacks
 (RISKS-33.35)

In the 1970s, IBM sold the 370/145, which did not have virtual memory.  Or
at least, that's what the POP (Principles of Operation = instruction set
handbook) said.

Being a moderately large customer, we had an on-site CE (repairman), with an
office set aside for his use. There was a hardcopy listing of the 145's
microcode (looking very much like any other assembly language) bound in a
large folder in the office -- which was not kept locked. One of our
programmers, having some time on his hands was leafing through this out of
idle curiosity and noticed that there were gaps in the address column:

10258 opcode operands
10259 opcode operands
10260 opcode operands
10536 opcode operands
10537 opcode operands
etc.

"Curiouser and curiouser". One of the things you could do at the console was
to "coredump" the microcode to the console "typewriter" (a 120 cps dot
matrix terminal). In hexadecimal with EBCDIC translation at the right.

Lo and behold, in one of the gaps there appeared the characters CROSS PAGE.

Well... wasn't that interesting?

He traced through the code and discovered that the machine came with virtual
memory, but when you loaded the appropriate bit into the control register,
the microcode would first check a "switch" -- actually a wire that the CE
could clip. We didn't actually own the 145 -- IBM was in the leasing
business in those days -- so we couldn't just take a pair of "dikes" and
clip it ourselves.

No problemo. It turns out that the "control registers" were in the microcode
address space.

He wrote a program called "wishbone". Set the load address to 00C (the card
reader), put the binary deck in the hopper, and push the IPL button. The
program loads and just sits there. You then have 2 minutes to set the
console dials to a particular address, push "set microprogram address", then
"start". The program that was loaded into the registers would execute, and
*patch* the microcode to ignore that wire and turn on virtual addressing. It
would also print out "Wish granted".

Then grab a copy of CP/67(*) on tape, IPL from the tape, and presto, you
have a virtual machine.

If you did nothing for 2 minutes, or if you pushed any other buttons, the
console would print out "Wish denied".

[CP/67 was a virtual machine OS for the 360 model 67. The 370/145 interface
was identical]

About 6 months later IBM announced virtual memory for the 145, the CE
clipped the wire, and we could run CP/67 officially.

Subject: Re: BMW's Heated as a Service Model Has Drivers Seeking Hacks
 (RISKS-33.35)

Back in the good old days, there was an IBM card reader where the difference
between the fast model and the slow one was a delay relay.  Needless to say,
academic departments all rented the slow one and bypassed the relay, and had
to try to remember to put it back when the CE came by.

I also believe there were some small mainframes that were always shipped
with the maximum amount of memory, with jumpers to enable the amount paid
for.

On some models of IBM 1130, the CPU cycle time was deliberately slowed down,
except that when it was taking interrupts from the printer, it needed to run
at full speed to set the print hammers before the rotating print drum moved
past the desired character position. You can imagine what students did with
that.

This annoyingly bad idea goes way back.

  [Someone who shall remain nameless, along with vendor's identity, sent me
  privately a different approach that I feel is worth doubly anonymizing, in
  case it is apocryphal:

    At one point [the vendor] did the same for a CPU upgrade. The field
    engineer would build a tent around the fridge-sized box, snip a wire,
    and come out in an hour or two with a VERY large bill.

Subject: Re: BMW's Heated as a Service Model Has Drivers Seeking Hacks
 (John Levine, RISKS-33.36)

You have a point -- but for computer equipment,  what's the alternative?
Companies make entirely different device models to satisfy various price
points? Make one mid-range model that doesn't satisfy most needs? Make one
model for the largest demand and ignore the rest? How are those better than
allowing one device presenting different capabilities to satisfy different
needs/budgets? Why is it annoying or even bad, vs.  happily meeting
different needs at different price points?

In fact, why is enabling different auto features for different prices bad?
Again, what would you suggest -- configure different cars for different
budgets? That's more expensive and requires more complex logistics, and who
does it help? Always enable all built-in features?  But then how to target
different needs/budgets?

That's not defending rental model for auto features -- it's bad enough that
software goes in that direction.

IBM DOES allow rental of speed boost features on installed equipment to meet
peak loads. That too satisfies customer requirements.

Or IBM's 1950s-1960s era line printers which were leased -- not sold -- at
different levels of speed controlled, customers discovered, by jumpers on a
plugboard.  Remove a jumper to get the higher speed, no cutting required.

The web article doesn't support the claim in the subject line that using
Google Search is "entirely prohibited". In any case, it is quite reasonable
to use DuckDuckGo instead of Google Search. GDPR issues aside, in a teaching
situation, you don't want the "personalisation" features of Google Search as
that could skew the search results -- particularly if several people share
the same computer.

This is nonsense, and I am surprised you published it.  The source is a Fox
"news" piece.  [*]

Nobody who understands medicine ever said that vaccinations would completely
prevent infection, but there is overwhelming evidence that if you are
vaccinated you are less likely to get sick, and you will get less sick if
you do.

  [* John, Thanks.  That's *exactly* why I ran it RISKS, without comments.
  "Overwhelming", you say?  But you might check out the website "How Bad Is
  My Batch", which if you you check your batch numbers, points out something
  else: 5% of the Pfizer and Moderna batches are apparently reponsible for
  80% of the bad reactions including deaths and permanent disablement from
  the vaccines.  So maybe only 95% of the batches do what you say.  PGN]
