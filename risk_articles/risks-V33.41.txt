Full text of (redacted) whistleblower disclosure re Twitter (84 pages)
https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22186683/twitter-whistleblower-disclosure.pdf [From Lauren Weinstein]

  [This item deserves some discussion here.  Mudge and his L0pht folks
  testified for the U.S. Senate Government Affairs Committee (as did
  I just before them) on 19 May 1998 in a hearing about how everything
  relating to computer and network security was badly broken.
  There is a youtube of the L0pht testimony and subsequent discussion,
  running 59 minutes:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVJldn_MmMY
  The L0pht were remarkably insightful pro-bono whistleblowers even then.
  The Russian state-sponsored hacker groups are now doing exactly what
  was being discussed 24 years ago in the oral testimony at about 28
  minutes into the hour.  Senator Fred Thompson asked whether they could
  actually make the Internet unusable in less than 30 minutes, and
  the answer was that one of them could indeed do that with just a few
  inserted packets.  Another Senator (Lieberman?) returns to that around
  49 minutes in.  The L0pht written testimony is also on line:
    https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/cyber-vault/2019-01-09/cybersecuritcy-when-hackers-went-hill-revisiting-l0pht-hearings-1998
  Space-Rogue noted to me that a transcript of the original testimony is here:
    https://www.spacerogue.net/wordpress/?p=602
  However, much of what is fascinating here are the Senators' responses.  All
  of this is worth reviewing today, primarily illustrating how little
  fundamental work has been done since then.  It was very refreshing for me
  to revisit this archival material.  The good news might be that the L0pht
  video has had almost a half-million views, and it is nice to know that our
  RISKS readers seem to be much more aware than nonreaders.  Incidentally,
  my written testimony is on my website and in the searchable Congressional
  Record, but I had looked for a video of my oral testimony, and i did not
  find one.  I am delighted I could find the L0pht's one so easily.  PGN]

The evolution of ransomware business models:  ransomware-as-a-service

https://sfstandard.com/business/fbi-warns-of-zeppelin-ransomware-attacks-targeting-bay-area-companies/

Two new trends raised alarm bells with law enforcement and cybersecurity
professionals.  One is a new focus on attacks on health care facilities and
organizations already burdened by the pandemic. The other is an evolution in
the business models around ransomware, with the Zeppelin software creating
an ecosystem of cybercrime-- whereby actors research at-risk organizations,
conduct attacks, negotiate ransoms and launder payments -- that Chan dubbed
*ransomware-as-a-service*.

Subject: 'Anti-Reflective' Coating Allows Wi-Fi Through Walls

Steve McCaskill, *TechRadar*, 18 Aug 2022,
via From: ACM TechNews

Scientists at Austria's Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien) and
France's University of Rennes have enabled Wi-Fi signals to pass through
walls more effectively. The method calculates an anti-reflective invisible
structure to a wall, which TU Wien's Stefan Rotter likened to "the
anti-reflective coating on your pair of glasses." The researchers
transmitted microwaves through a labyrinth of obstacles, then calculated a
matching anti-reflective structure that almost completely removed the
signals' reflection. "We were able to show that this information can be used
to calculate a corresponding compensating structure for any medium that
scatters waves in a complex way, so that the combination of both media
allows waves to pass through completely," explained TU Wien's Michael
Horodynski.

  "The team developed a device with the appearance of a home Wi-Fi router,
  but instead of providing Internet access, the device emits radio signals,
  analyzes their reflections off the surrounding environment, and extracts
  the subject's breathing patterns without any bodily contact.  The
  breathing signal is then fed to the neural network to assess Parkinson's
  in a passive manner, and there is zero effort needed from the patient and
  caregiver."

Could they adapt this technology to make a stealth contactless lie detector?

best. But the main signals come from fidgeting especially in the upper arms

A set of hackers managed to impersonate Binance chief communications officer
(CCO) Patrick Hillmann in a series of video calls with several
representatives of cryptocurrency projects. The attackers used what Hillman
described as an AI hologram, a deepfake of his image for this objective, and
managed to fool some representatives of these projects, making them think
Hillmann was helping them get listed on the exchange.

Subject: MS-DEFCON 3: Issues with bootloader patches @AskWoody
 (Susan Bradley)

This month's updates are a great example of why my patching advice
differs for consumers and businesses.

For consumer patchers, whether using Windows 10 Home or Professional, I'm
not convinced that you need to install KB5012170, Microsoft's security
update for Secure Boot DBX (the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database).
Unless, that is, you think you will be targeted by an overseas attacker with
a malicious bootloader installer. If your computer holds the keys to the
nuclear codes, then by all means install this update instantly. The fact
that this isn't clear-cut is the reason I can lower the MS-DEFCON only to 3
this time around.

Subject: How 40,000 people used a Lockport woman's SSN: 078-05-1120.

Proving there's nothing new under the sun:

That's the most used -- or misused -- Social Security number in history, and
it belonged to a woman from Lockport.

The federal government originally issued that number to Hilda Schrader
Whitcher in the 1930s. But over the next four decades more than 40,000
people mistakenly claimed it for themselves.

And: Social Security Cards Issued by Woolworth

The most misused SSN of all time was (078-05-1120). In 1938, wallet
manufacturer the E. H. Ferree company in Lockport, New York decided to
promote its product by showing how a Social Security card would fit into its
wallets. A sample card, used for display purposes, was inserted in each
wallet. Company Vice President and Treasurer Douglas Patterson thought it
would be a clever idea to use the actual SSN of his secretary, Mrs. Hilda
Schrader Whitcher.

One has to sigh -- how true is that today across a whole range of

Oh well -- and I guess one has to be careful even to utter that sentence

Subject: Re: Voters in the UK Cast Ballots Online, in Test for Internet
 Voting, (WSJ, RISKS-33.40)

Given that this is the Conservative party we're talking about, I think the
biggest security threat is inside the tent. Use the postal strikes (which
they've done nothing about because it feeds their anti-union plans) to get
most party members to vote online, then 'fix' the result to the one the
party itself wants.

Yes, I'm being very cynical, but 12+ years of Conservative (mis)government
will do that to you. The Russians don't need to hack us anymore, we (or
rather the Conservatives) can do that work for them now.

So their solution was to severely degrade the quality of audio playback to
try and stop the laptop from crashing when certain sound frequencies were
playing near the laptop? Never mind that laptop would still crash if a
laptop nearby (or just about any other audio device) happened to play those
frequencies!
