 (Alexandra Posadzki)

  [This is an update to the Interac item in RISKS-33.32 on the outage.  PGN]

Alexandra Posadzki, *The Globe and Mail* (Canada), 25 Jul 2022)

Millions of Canadians lost their cellphone, Internet, or home phone service
for at least a day due to a coding error on 8 Jul 2022, when Rogers
Communications was upgrading its wireless/broadband infrastructure. The
telecommunications company has one core network that supports all its
services, and company documents indicated a piece of code deleted a routing
filter during the sixth phase of the seven-phase infrastructure upgrade. The
deletion caused all possible channels to the Internet to pass through the
routers, resulting in several devices exceeding their memory and processing
capacities, inducing a network shutdown. Rogers uses equipment from
different manufacturers in its network, and its router suppliers have
different traffic management and overload safeguards, which the documents
identified as the source of the outage.

This is a remarkable piece of honest journalism, with eight NYT opinion
columnists revisiting their earlier incorrect predictions.

  *The New York Times* Sunday Opinions, 24 July 2022

Thomas L. Friedman highlighted one of our recurring themes in RISKS,
in his piece entitled "I was wrong about Chinese censorship":

  ``Trust is a byproduct of truth, and truth is a product of a free
    and independent press -- not everywhere and always, but more
    often than not.''

In RISKS, we try to let the truth tell the story, with some help from
readers to get it closer to truth.  Thanks again.  However, as we have said

*The New York Times* National Edition 27 Jul 2022 centerfold pp. A10-A11,

China's ambition to collect a staggering amount of personal data from
everyday citizens is more expansive than previously known.  ...
Phone-tracking devices are everywhere.  The police are creating some of the
largest DNA databases in the world.  And the authorities are building upon
facial recognition technology to collect voice prints from the general
public.

Here are the bold-faced section heads in the full two-page article:

* The Chinese police analyze human behaviors to ensure facial recognition
  cameras capture as much activity as possible.

* The authorities are using phone trackers to link people's digital lives to
  their physical movements.

* DNA, iris scan samples, and voice prints are being collected
  indiscriminately from people with no connection to crime.

* The government wants to connect all of these data points to build
  comprehensive profiles for citizens -- which would be accessible
  throughout the government.

Subject: Voice Jammer Stops Anyone from Recording Your Speech
 (Matthew Sparkes)

Matthew Sparkes, *New Scientist*, 29 Jul 2022,
via ACM TechNews, 1 Aug 2022

Michigan State University's Qiben Yan and colleagues have developed an
artificial-intelligence voice jammer that can prevent anyone from recording
the speech of a single target person. The Neural Enhanced Cancellation (NEC)
tool exploits a bug contained within most microphones by introducing sounds
at set distances above and below the microphone's recording frequencies. NEC
taps this flaw to play inverse speech in the ultrasonic range outside of
human hearing, the frequencies needed to clandestinely block an audible
voice. The tool effectively blocked voices when tested on a range of Apple,
Xiaomi, and Samsung smartphones from up to 3.6 meters (nearly 12 feet) away.

 (Natasha Singer)


Natasha Singer, *The New York Times*, 31 Jul 2022,
via ACM TechNews, 1 Aug 2022

A cyberattack on student-tracking software provider Illuminate Education
highlights the inadequacies of student privacy safeguards. The breach
worries cybersecurity and privacy experts because it involved sensitive
personal details about students or student data dating back over 10
years. Technology companies and education reformers have pressured schools
to adopt software that can catalog and categorize student behavior to help
educators identify and assist at-risk students. With hacks on school
software vendors increasing, the exposure of such information could have
long-term ramifications. Said New Mexico attorney general Hector Balderas,
"My concern is there will be bad actors who will exploit a public school
setting, especially when they think that the technology protocols are not
very robust. And I don't know why Congress isn't terrified yet."

Subject: Chess-playing robot grabs child opponent's finger and breaks it
 (TechSpot)

https://www.techspot.com/news/95405-watch-chess-playing-robot-grabs-child-opponent-finger.html

According to Sergey Smagin, vice-president of the Russian Chess Federation,
the boy responded before the robot had completed its move. [..]

Smagin seemed to put most of the blame on the victim. "There are certain
safety rules and the child, apparently, violated them. When he made his
move, he did not realize he first had to wait, This is an extremely rare
case, the first I can recall.''

1.  As a parent, I find the assumption that a nine-year-old will perfectly
  follow ANY sort of rule profoundly optimistic :).

2. It's an industrial robot, and they tend to have pressure sensitive grips
(exactly because full force could crush whatever they grab).  Unless the
chess pieces were made of uranium, gold or other overly dense material (the
brain matter of the operators involved?), there should have been a low grip
force set, low enough for a child to wiggle out of.

3. In most civilised countries, human + proximity to powerful mechanics
tends to mandate a nearby emergency stop.  Oops.

I get the impression that the rule breaking child exposed at a minimum a
lack of critical thinking of the parties involved.

  [Even if corporations are people (Citizens United) and AI machines are
  people, industrial-strength robots should not be allowed to play chess.

Extra features have been built into the software of cars for a number of

"Theoretically, these algorithms could be good for competition. For example,
if one business sets a price, the algorithm could automatically undercut it,
resulting in a lower price for the consumer.

"But it doesn't quite work that way, MacKay said. In a paper he co-authored
in the National Bureau of Economic Research, he studied the way algorithms
compete. He found that when multiple businesses used pricing algorithms,
both knew that decreasing their price would cause their rival to decrease
their price, which could set off a never-ending chain of price decreases."

Subject: Average Data Breach Costs Hit a Record $4.4 Million, Report Says
 (CNET)

Bree Fowler, CNET, 27 July 2022

  The average cost of a data breach rose to an all-time high of $4.M  marked
  a 2.6% increase from a year ago and a 13% jump since 2020.

  More than half of the organizations surveyed acknowledged they had passed
  on those costs to their customers in the form of higher prices for their
  products and services, IBM said.

  The annual report is based on an analysis of data breaches experienced by
  550 organizations around the world between March 2021 and March 2022. The
  research, which was sponsored and analyzed by IBM, was conducted by the
  Ponemon Institute.

  The cost estimates are based on both immediate and longer-term expenses.
  While some costs like the payment of ransoms and those related to
  investigating and containing the breach tend to be accounted for right
  away, others such as regulatory fines and lost sales can show up years
  later. On average, those polled said they accrued just under half of the
  costs related to a given breach more than a year after it occurred.

The UK recently declined to regulate prize draws as a form of gambling, but
does it matter? The industry has moved on to more problematic ways to make
money.

Whenever a term from the world of video games enters broader society, it’s a
safe bet that it's not for a good reason. Loot boxes -- like Hot Coffee or
Gamergate -- don;t buck this trend. For at least the past five years, driven
by a mix of grassroots Reddit organizing and parental horror stories -- "my
teen spent £6,000 on FIFA cards"—-- these randomized prize draws have
attracted the world's ire; in several countries, they're now illegal. Last
week, after a 22-month consultation, the UK government decided that loot
boxes will not be regulated under betting laws. Despite finding a link
between these systems and problem gambling, the government has left
regulation up to the industry.

International de Poids et Mesures or BIPM), Amazon, Google, and Microsoft
all want to put an end to leap seconds.

Why? As Meta explained in a blog post
<https://engineering.fb.com/2022/07/25/production-engineering/its-time-to-leave-the-leap-second-in-the-past/>,
"We bump into problems whenever a leap second is introduced. And because
it's such a rare event, it devastates the community every time it
happens. With a growing demand for clock precision across all industries,
the leap second is now causing more damage than good, resulting in
disturbances and outages."

Therefore, Meta concludes, we should simply "stop the future introduction of
leap seconds."

Subject: BMW's 3,854-Variable Problem Solved in Six Minutes with Quantum
 Computing (Francisco Pires)

Francisco Pires, *Tom's Hardware*, 28 Jul 2022,
via ACM TechNews, 1 Aug 2022

Quantum Computing Inc. (QCI) solved a 3,854-variable optimization problem
for German automaker BMW in six minutes, using its Entropy Quantum Computing
(EQC) solution to determine the ideal placement of vehicle sensors in BMW's
Vehicle Sensor Placement Challenge 2022. EQC factors the changing
environment into its calculations, saving time and expense by not having to
control for all variables outside the Quantum Processing Unit. Said QCI's
Bob Liscouski, "We believe that this proves that innovative quantum
computing technologies can solve real business problems today."

Subject: Re: UK proposes new rule for AI (Law Gazette)

How would they define AI?

If we had a black box that we communicated with, what test would prove that
the content of the bos is or is not an AI?

I prefer a broad definition of AI. I would include James Watt's flyball
governor from 1788.  It figured out for itself how to manipulate the
throttle, and it displaced human workers who could have done the same thing.
That sounds to me like an AI.

Don't forget that trained-neural-networks being almost the only way to
implement AI may not be a durable paradigm.

Subject: Re: MIT scientists think they've discovered how to fully reverse
 climate change (BGR, RISKS-33.33)

Dan Eakins posted a link with a tantalizing subject and geoff goodfellow
followed up with more details. However, neither one mentioned the
significant risks of attempts at solar radiation management (the usual term
for blocking some incoming sunlight).

The first big risk is that less incoming short-wave radiation means less
evaporated water which will lead to significant drops in global
precipitation. This could threaten drinking water supplies and crop yields
around the world. Some studies suggest that trying to block sunlight only in
polar regions would provide cooling without as much loss of precipitation
(e.g., https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/14/7769/2014/) but this is
difficult to do and is not attainable from some sort of sun shield sitting
at L1 as suggested in the article.

A second risk is that cooling only with solar radiation management does
nothing to affect the buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere or the oceans. This
means continued acidification of the oceans and a large rebound effect any
time the solar radiation management is interrupted or stopped.

    in every issue of RISKS.  However, some employers or government
    contracts require their presence.  PGN]

Subject: ACM Launches New Journal on Responsible Computing

https://www.acm.org/media-center/2022/july/jrc-launch

ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery, announced it is now accepting
submissions for a new publication, the ACM Journal on Responsible Computing
(JRC). The launch of this new ACM journal reflects both the phenomenal
growth of computing around the world and the profound impact computing
technologies continue to have on so many aspects of life and society as a
whole.

JRC will publish high-quality original research at the intersection of
computing, ethics, information, law, policy, responsible innovation, and
social responsibility from a wide range of convergent, interdisciplinary,
multidisciplinary, and transdisciplinary perspectives. The editorial board
welcomes papers using any or a combination of computational, conceptual,
qualitative, quantitative, and other methods to make contributions to
knowledge, methods, practice, and theory, broadly defined.

  [Lauren has spent many years addressing all of the issues that will be
  covered by the JRC.  He is of course the person behind People for Internet
  Responsibility, the Network Neutrality Squad, and the Privacy Forum, from
  which I have derived many RISKS items over the past four decades.  I am
  enomrously grateful for his steadfast concern and insights.  PGN]

Subject: On-demand education program of medical safety (MSPO)

In April 2022, we generated the Medical Safety Promotion Organization (MSPO,
NPO equivalent) concerning research and education of medical safety (i.e.,
patient safety and healthcare safety for mega disaster and pandemic
infectious diseases).

In January 2023, MSPO launches the High Education Program of Medical
Safety (HEPMS).  It is one year education school for health experts
to promote knowledges and skills in this specific field.  All lessons are
English on-demand programs.

Here is the application guide.
