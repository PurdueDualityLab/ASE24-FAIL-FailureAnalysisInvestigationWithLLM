Subject: Potential nationwide weakness in hospital emergency power

An incident in a hospital in Roermond, the Netherlands, uncovered a problem
that may be present in more hospitals.

a free summary/translation of ,
http://nos.nl/artikel/2004721-tno-noodstroom-ziekenhuizen-onzeker.html>

In the Roermond hospital, the emergency power did not start due to a poorly
charged battery of the computer controlling the emergency power. This
battery ought to be charged continuously. The poor charging state had not
been detected by regular checks and tests.

The battery has a normal life time of 10 years and was only 3 years old at
the moment of failure. Batteries are normally changed after 5 years.

Switching back when power was available again also went wrong. TNO (the
Dutch applied research institute who investigated the failure) suspect the
low voltage caused by the poor battery. TNO recommend to use redundant
batteries.

Sampling other hospitals showed similar configurations in at least 10 other
hospitals.

Subject: The Patient Will See You Now (Eric Topol)

Print headline on this: Soon your phone will be as smart as your doctor

Topol sees a future in which "your smartphone will become central to labs,
physical exams, and even medical imaging; and you can have ICU-like
[intensive-care unit] monitoring in the safety, reduced expense, and
convenience of your home."  This is a book full of technical wizardry and
intriguing questions about the nature -- and the future -- of diagnosing,
monitoring and healing.

...and insurance companies will limit coverage to buying cheap phones and
medical apps up to $0.99; doctors no longer needed. At least it will be
easier getting appointments with your phone.

  "An electronic dongle used to connect to the onboard diagnostic systems of
  more than two million cars and trucks contains few defenses against
  hacking, an omission that makes them vulnerable to wireless attacks that
  take control of a vehicle, according to published reports.  US-based
  Progressive Insurance said it has used the SnapShot device in more than
  two million vehicles since 2008. The dongle tracks users' driving to help
  determine if they qualify for lower rates. According to security
  researcher Corey Thuen, it performs no validation or signing of firmware
  updates, has no secure boot mechanism, no cellular communications
  authentication, and uses no secure communications protocols. SnapShot
  connects to the OBDII port of Thuen's 2013 Toyota Tundra pickup truck,
  according to Forbes. From there, it runs on the CANbus networks that
  control braking, park assist and steering, and other sensitive functions."

Subject: Schneider Electric SCADA Gateway contains hardcoded credentials

Much has been made of the benefits and detriments of the Internet of Things
(IoT). Security, integrity, and privacy problems are a particular
challenge. Implementing ease of use while maintaining security is a
challenge. There have been many cases of consumer and SOHO devices coming
with pre-installed credentials and backdoors. The problem is even more
serious with industrial systems where compromised credentials can permit
conversion of a network attack into an attack with serious physical
consequences.  Reportedly, the Schneider Electric SCADA Gateway comes with
pre-installed, known FTP credentials. An update is reported to permit FTP
access to be disabled, but the credentials remain.  The original article is

*The NY Times* Dealbook column has reported the establishment of Hacker's
List, a website providing an exchange allowing those in "need" of hacking
attacks to interact with providers of the services.  Exchanges that
facilitate monetized hacking, serve to reduce the costs of hacking to a
level compatible with consumer purchases is not a positive development.
Exchanges for such activities accentuate the trend of hacking for profit,
which has been building for nearly two decades.  The original article is at:

Subject: Why Western Governments Want to Destroy Computer Security
  -- and Your Security Along the Way

 Lauren Weinstein's Blog Update, 15 Jan 2015
http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/001084.html

It's always illuminating when the longtime enemies of security and free
speech come out from the shadows, making their intentions and sensibilities
crystal clear for all to see and understand.

Nope, I'm not talking about terrorists of whatever stripes -- we've always
known how criminal scum like that thinks and how they desire to remake the
world in the image of their tiny minds and 13th century mindsets.

Nor am I speaking of Putin, Kim Jong-un, Ali Khamenei, Xi Jinping, or the
like -- the iron fist with which these leaders desire to control speech and
suppress domestic dissent is all too obvious even at a glance.

No. I'm painfully forced to note the new threat matrix aimed squarely at
shedding our free speech and security rights that is spewing squarely from
Western governments -- from the U.S., U.K, and across the length and breadth
of Europe.

It's tempting to suggest that this renewed push to strip us of these
fundamental rights was triggered by the recent devastating terrorist attack
in Paris -- but that horrendous event serves only as an excuse for a long
simmering, long sought crackdown on Internet speech and security that has
been smoldering for ages.

Going all the way back to 1993 and the fiasco of the proposed U.S. "Clipper
Chip" reveals the U.S. intelligence community's fear of strong
cryptography. And today, the EU's enthusiastic embrace of the nightmarish
"Right to Be Forgotten" concept, and their push to apply that EU censorship
system across the entire world, gives us clues to European motives along
these lines.

So for anyone really paying close attention to these matters, the dots were
already pretty much in place, certainly sufficiently so that the latest
proposals from Western leaders shouldn't come as any kind of significant
surprise.

And those repulsive proposals have been arriving hot and heavy over the last
few days.

President Obama is reportedly to offer a vast expansion of criminal
penalties for "computer hacking" broadly defined, and as part of that
legislative package also to vastly expand the definition of hacking in the
process.

If you thought the late Aaron Swartz really had the book thrown at him by
DOJ, the new proposals would likely make that look like a paperback novel
compared with a wall of ancient encyclopedias dumped on the heads of future
defendants.

The details we've heard so far reportedly suggest that at the discretion of
prosecutors, merely clicking the wrong link on a public site, or conducting
perfectly legitimate cybersecurity research, could net you being shackled in
a federal cell for a decade or more.

But it gets worse.

Western leaders, led by David Cameron of the UK, appear poised to demand
that all Internet communications be subject to data retention and monitoring
by governments, and that no applications be permitted to deploy encryption
that the government could not disable or defeat on demand. Prime Minister
Cameron has said this explicitly of late, and is seeking support from other
European leaders and President Obama for this disastrous concept.

Let's be crystal clear about this. While the initial discussion might
revolve around instant messaging apps, it's obvious that the logical and
inevitable extension of this concept is to require the undermining of all
Internet encryption. Email. PGP. The works.

And what you can't backdoor or otherwise undermine you simply outlaw, with
criminal penalties draconian enough to scare off all but the most dedicated
or masochistic of free speech and security activists.

The word "security" is critical here, because while these leaders are
claiming that such proposals would enhance security to "protect us from the
terrorists" -- in reality the proposed decimation of the foundational
structures of cryptographic systems would put all of us -- our personal
information, our power systems, our industrial facilities, and so many other
aspects of our lives -- at the mercy of cyberattacks newly enabled by such
weakened and so inevitability exploitable encryption ecosystems.

Without any exaggeration, this may easily be the most serious threat to
Internet security -- and so to the entire global community that now depends
on the Internet for so many facets of our lives -- since the first ARPANET
messages clattered over a teletype at UCLA decades ago.

Legitimate and measured means to fight against the scourge of terrorism are
essential. But those do not include trying to convert the secure
communications of law abiding citizens -- billions of them -- into "tap on
demand" portals for government snoops, no matter how ostensibly laudable or
graphically terrifying those officials attempt to frame their arguments.

We've all come to expect the "government owns your communications"
propaganda from Putin and his ilk.

To hear the same sort of twisted reasoning -- no matter how candy coated or
sprinkled with excuses -- flinging forth from our Western leaders is
disheartening in the extreme, and must not be accepted without vigorous
challenge, debate, and due consideration for the enormous damage such
proposals could easily wreak on us all.

Subject: 4th-Party Collection: NSA's Wink Wink Nod Nod to the 4th Amendment

FYI -- You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours, whether or not I even
know you.  The NSA's "4th Party Collection" provides the mechanism for
gathering information that the NSA can't legally collect on its own.  By
spying on other spies, the NSA avoids a problem the FBI ran into in the
1950's, when there were sometimes so many illegal taps on a labor union's
phone lines that the labor unionists could barely hear the person at the
other end of the phone conversation.  The NSA has already run into computers
& routers with surveillance malware from spy organizations from multiple
countries simultaneously!

``The practice of letting other intelligence services do the dirty work and
then tapping their results is so successful that the NSA even has a name for
it: Fourth Party Collection.''

The Digital Arms Race: NSA Preps America for Future Battle

By Jacob Appelbaum, Aaron Gibson, Claudio Guarnieri, Andy Müller-Maguhn,
Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach, Leif Ryge, Hilmar Schmundt and Michael
Sontheimer

The NSA's mass surveillance is just the beginning.  Documents from Edward
Snowden show that the intelligence agency is arming America for future
digital wars -- a struggle for control of the Internet that is already well
underway.  .........

Part 2: How the NSA Reads Over Shoulders of Other Spies

In addition to providing a view of the US's own ability to conduct digital
attacks, Snowden's archive also reveals the capabilities of other countries.
The Transgression team has access to years of preliminary field work and
experience at its disposal, including databases in which malware and network
attacks from other countries are cataloged.

The Snowden documents show that the NSA and its Five Eyes partners have put
numerous network attacks waged by other countries to their own use in recent
years.  One 2009 document states that the department's remit is to
"discover, understand (and) evaluate" foreign attacks.  Another document
reads: "Steal their tools, tradecraft, targets and take."

In 2009, an NSA unit took notice of a data breach affecting workers at the
US Department of Defense.  The department traced an IP address in Asia that
functioned as the command center for the attack.  By the end of their
detective work, the Americans succeeded not only in tracing the attack's
point of origin to China, but also in tapping intelligence information from
other Chinese attacks -- including data that had been stolen from the United
Nations.  Afterwards, NSA workers in Fort Meade continued to read over their
shoulders as the Chinese secretly collected further internal UN data.  "NSA
is able to tap into Chinese SIGINT collection," a report on the success in
2011 stated.  SIGINT is short for signals intelligence.

The practice of letting other intelligence services do the dirty work and
then tapping their results is so successful that the NSA even has a name for
it: "Fourth Party Collection."  And all countries that aren't part of the
Five Eye alliance are considered potential targets for use of this
"non-traditional" technique -- even Germany.

'Difficult To Track, Difficult To Target'

The Snowden documents show that, thanks to fourth party collection, the NSA
succeeded in detecting numerous incidents of data spying over the past 10
years, with many attacks originating from China and Russia.  It also enabled
the Tailored Access Operations (TAO) to track down the IP address of the
control server used by China and, from there, to detect the people
responsible inside the Peoples' Liberation Army.  It wasn't easy, the NSA
spies noted.  The Chinese had apparently used changing IP addresses, making
them "difficult to track; difficult to target."  In the end, though, the
document states, they succeeded in exploiting a central router.

The document suggests that things got more challenging when the NSA sought
to turn the tables and go after the attacker.  Only after extensive "wading
through uninteresting data" did they finally succeed in infiltrating the
computer of a high-ranking Chinese military official and accessing
information regarding targets in the US government and in other governments
around the world.  They also were able to access sourcecode for Chinese
malware.
