HOT-WIRE MY HEART: Critical flaw lets hackers control lifesaving devices
implanted inside patients; Implanted devices from Medtronic can have their
firmware rewritten, DHS warns.

https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/critical-flaw-lets-hackers-control-lifesaving-devices-implanted-inside-patients/

Summary: There are many people alive today because they carry implanted
medical devices in their bodies.  The devices have computers and wireless
communication capabilities.  Unsurprisingly, if they are devoid of standard
security protections, they are completely hackable.  The Conexus Radio
Frequency Telemetry Protocol, which is Medtronic's proprietary means for the
monitors to wirelessly connect to implanted devices, has a "raft" of
security weaknesses that leave them open to everything from privacy
violations to complete reprogramming by anyone within wireless range.
Medtronic emphasizes that no device has ever actually been hacked, and that
they are responding to US Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency' advisory

Cade Metz and Craig S. Smith, *The New York Times*, 21 Mar 2019
via ACM TechNews, 25 Mar 2019

Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
researchers warn in a recently published study that new artificial
intelligence (AI) technology designed to enhance healthcare is vulnerable to
misuse, with "adversarial attacks" that can deceive the system into making
misdiagnoses being one example. A more likely scenario is of doctors,
hospitals, and other organizations manipulating the AI in billing or
insurance software in an attempt to maximize revenue. The researchers said
software developers and regulators must consider such possibilities as they
build and evaluate AI technologies in the years to come. MIT's Samuel
Finlayson said, "The inherent ambiguity in medical information, coupled with
often-competing financial incentives, allows for high-stakes decisions to
swing on very subtle bits of information." Changes doctors make to medical
scans or other patient data in an effort to satisfy the AI used by insurance
firms also could wind up in a patient's permanent record.

  [Monty Solomon noted from that article:
Machine-learning systems could be a boon to medicine. But they also can be
hacked to mislead, researchers are discovering.

       Beware of compromised automated update mechanisms.  PGN]

The Taiwan-based tech giant ASUS is believed to have pushed the malware to
hundreds of thousands of customers through its trusted automatic software
update tool after attackers compromised the company's server and used it to
push the malware to machines.
https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pan9wn/hackers-hijacked-asus-software-updates-to-install-backdoors-on-thousands-of-computers

EXCERPT:

Researchers at cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab say that ASUS, one of the
world's largest computer makers, was used to unwittingly install a malicious
backdoor on thousands of its customers' computers last year after attackers
compromised a server for the company's live software update tool.  The
malicious file was signed with legitimate ASUS digital certificates to make
it appear to be an authentic software update from the company, Kaspersky Lab
says.

ASUS, a multi-billion dollar computer hardware company based in Taiwan
https://www.asus.com/us/ that manufactures desktop computers, laptops,
mobile phones, smart home systems, and other electronics, was pushing the
backdoor to customers for at least five months last year before it was
discovered, according to new research from the Moscow-based security firm.

The researchers estimate half a million Windows machines received the
malicious backdoor through the ASUS update server, although the attackers
appear to have been targeting only about 600 of those systems. The malware
searched for targeted systems through their unique MAC addresses. Once on a
system, if it found one of these targeted addresses, the malware reached out
to a command-and-control server the attackers operated, which then installed
additional malware on those machines.

Kaspersky Lab said it uncovered the attack in January 2019 after adding a
new supply-chain detection technology to its scanning tool to catch
anomalous code fragments hidden in legitimate code or catch code that is
hijacking normal operations on a machine. The company plans to release a
full technical paper and presentation about the ASUS attack, which it has
dubbed ShadowHammer, next month at its Security Analyst Summit
https://sas.kaspersky.com/ in Singapore.  In the meantime, Kaspersky has
published some of the technical details on its website.  [...]

Check out these rather ordinary looking portraits. They're all fake. Not in
the sense that they were Photoshopped, but rather they were *completely
generated by artificial intelligence*.  That's right: none of these people
actually exist.

NVIDIA researchers have published a new paper

on easily customizing the style of realistic faces created by a generative
adversarial network (GAN).

*The Verge* points out that GAN has only existed for about four years.

In the spring of 1990, Coke announced something called `MagiCans' — you
can see a (grainy) ad from the campaign here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOBCKnhFwE_4

The stunt, the centerpiece to their $100 million `Magic Summer' marketing
push, was simple. Some cans of Coca-Cola Classic were loaded with coupons,
gift certificates, and most importantly, cash — up to $500. The prize cans
were spring-loaded, as seen above; if the mechanism worked properly, the
prize would pop up once the can was popped open. Those cans didn't contain
Coke, though; as the ad warned, ``If you see anything other than Coca-Cola
Classic in that can, don't drink from it,'' as prize cans were `winners'
but, alas, didn't contain any actual soda. Instead, they contained a sealed
chamber of chlorinated water with a foul odor, intending to mask the weight
of the prize while also stopping winners from taking a sip in case it
somehow leaked.

Technology -- what could go wrong? Too bad pre-Internet cans could have been
WiFi enabled to automatically broadcast sight and sound of people's
reactions to surprise contents. Not being a soda drinker, I missed this fun.

Subject: Russia wants to cut itself off from the global Internet.
  Here's what that really means.  (MIT Tech Review)

*The plan is going to be tricky to pull off, both technically and
politically, but the Kremlin has set its sights on self-sufficiency.*

EXCERPT:

In the next two weeks, Russia is planning to attempt something no other
country has tried before. It's going to test whether it can disconnect from
the rest of the world electronically while keeping the Internet running for
its citizens. This means it will have to reroute all its data internally,
rather than relying on servers abroad.

The test is key to a proposed `sovereign Internet' law currently working its
way through Russia's government. It looks likely to be eventually voted
through and signed into law by President Vladimir Putin, though it has
stalled in parliament for now.

Pulling an iron curtain down over the Internet is a simple idea, but don't
be fooled: it's a fiendishly difficult technical challenge to get right. It
is also going to be very expensive. The project's initial cost has been set
at $38 million by Russia's financial watchdog, but it's likely to require
far more funding than that. One of the authors of the plan has said it'll
be more like $304 million, Bloomberg reports, but even that figure,
industry experts say, won't be enough to get the system up and running, let
alone maintain it.

Not only that, but it has already proved deeply unpopular with the general
public. An estimated 15,000 people took to the streets in Moscow earlier
this month to protest the law, one of the biggest demonstrations in years.

* Operation disconnect*

So how will Russia actually disconnect itself from the global Internet?
``It is unclear what the `disconnect test' might entail,'' says Andrew
Sullivan, president and CEO of the Internet Society. All we know is that if
it passes, the new law will require the nation's Internet service providers
(ISPs) to use only exchange points inside the country that are approved by
Russia's telecoms regulator, Roskomnadzor.

These exchange points are where Internet service providers connect with
each other. It's where their cabling meets at physical locations to
exchange traffic. These locations are overseen by organizations known as
Internet exchange providers (IXPs). Russia's largest IXP is in Moscow,
connecting cities in Russia's east but also Riga in neighboring Latvia.

MSK-IX, as this exchange point is known, is one of the world's largest. It
connects over 500 different ISPs and handles over 140 gigabits of throughput
during peak hours on weekdays. There are six other Internet exchange points
in Russia, spanning most of its 11 time zones. Many ISPs also use exchanges
that are physically located in neighboring countries or that are owned by
foreign companies. These would now be off limits. Once this stage is
completed, it would provide Russia with a literal, physical `on/off switch'
to decide whether its Internet is shielded from the outside world or kept
open.

* What's in a name?*

As well as rerouting its ISPs, Russia will also have to unplug from the
global domain name system (DNS) so traffic cannot be rerouted through any
exchange points that are not inside Russia.

The DNS is basically a phone book for the Internet: when you type, for
example, `google.com' into your browser, your computer uses the DNS to
translate this domain name into an IP address, which identifies the correct
server on the Internet to send the request. If one server won't respond to a
request, another will step in. Traffic behaves rather like water -- it will
seek any gap it can to flow through.

``The creators of the DNS wanted to create a system able to work even when
bits of it stopped working, regardless of whether the decision to break
parts of it was deliberate or accidental,'' says Brad Karp, a computer
scientist at University College London. This in-built resilience in the
underlying structure of the Internet will make Russia's plan even harder to
carry out.

The actual mechanics of the DNS are operated by a wide variety of
organizations, but a majority of the `root servers', which are its
foundational layer, are run by groups in the US. Russia sees this as a
strategic weakness and wants to create its own alternative, setting up an
entire new network of its own root servers.

``An alternate DNS can be used to create an alternate reality for the
majority of Russian Internet users,'' says Ameet Naik, an expert on Internet
monitoring for the software company ThousandEyes.  ``Whoever controls this
directory controls the Internet.''  Thus, if Russia can create its own DNS,
it will have at least a semblance of control over the Internet within its
borders.

This won't be easy, says Sullivan. It will involve configuring tens of
thousands of systems, and it will be difficult, if not impossible, to
identify all the different access points citizens use to get online (their
laptops, smartphones, iPads, and so on). Some of them will be using servers
abroad, such as Google's Public DNS, which Russia simply won't be able to
replicate -- so the connection will fail when a Russian user tries to access
them... [...]  MIT

Subject: Tweet by Soldier of FORTRAN on Twitter

Condensed from a Twitter thread starting at: https://twitter.com/mainframed767/status/1108782021571076096, @mainframed767 tells the following story:

  Auditors were reviewing logs for some appliance that used a default
  account.  Every time the account was used, it wrote the username and
  password in the logs as an easy-to-identify log entry. ... So, how did
  they fix it?  The vendor wouldn't fix the issue because the product was no
  longer supported, but the business still needed it for a few more years.
  Search your heart and guess what they did:

    1 - Migrated to a new app
    2 - Disabled logging as a whole
    3 - Changed the default password to ********

  If you guessed option 3 you're right! They changed the password to
  ********, and then when the auditors reviewed it they just assumed it was
  fixed because the passwords looked as if they had been masked!  Genius.

Subject: EU passes their nightmare copyright legislation

The EU has passed their nightmare copyright legislation that will crush the
rights of ordinary EU users and will attempt to infect the rest of the world
with its poisons.

My recommendation -- seriously -- is to cut EU countries off from the Net in
all related respects as soon as they start to try make trouble for non-EU
countries or global firms.

Based on Article 11, I'd cut them off from Google News entirely, and
drastically cut back their appearances in Google Search if they try to push
their link tax onto Google.

Global firms should consider refusing all content uploads from EU countries
where Article 13 issues are in force.

If the EU wants to treat their own citizens in such an atrocious way that's
their business. But the rest of the planet doesn't have to put up with this
sociopathic behavior by the EU.

Wall off the EU from all associated global Internet services until they come
to their senses.

Subject: One dead battery + app = two dead batteries

It was a foggy night. My pal parked his spanking new rental car on the
remote mountaintop.

Everything was fine except that one red blinking dashboard light that we
couldn't get to turn off. (That might mean a dead battery when we get
back... Stranded on the mountain!)

Each "on" part of the light's on-off cycle was so short that there was
not enough time for the eye to figure out its complex shape and thus
meaning.

Shining a flashlight on it just revealed a flat panel, with the shape
template invisible below.

"Hmmm, all doors closed, but perhaps not locked." I said. (No criminals
on the misty mountain, plus I bet he will lock himself out, but let's
try it anyway.)

"I need to use the rental company app to lock the doors, but my phone is
out of battery." he said.

RISK: one dead battery leads to another dead battery when an app is involved.

(How about just disconnecting the battery cable? Better not. What if the
car starts talking in Italian like in Toy Story, or detect it is being
attacked and lift off and fly home to mother?)

for the project with his brother when the two competed in -- and won -- a
hackathon at Austin's SXSW festival in 2014. Since then, Sawhney has

as the second testing ground for its voting system. The city is trying the
app in its May 7th municipal election, early voting for which starts today.

I asked Sawhney why he decided to incorporate a blockchain into his
system. He says it's so that IT administrators within and outside his
company can't manipulate or delete records at will. Voatz uses so-called
permissioned ledgers, meaning only authorized parties can operate them.  In
this case, the voting database is distributed across 32 computing nodes

Subject: Apple Life+

Apple has always had partisans with a devotion bordering on fanaticism.
(Although UNIX is the one, true operating system, and Thompson is its
prophet, it is Apple that has inspired the most hard core religious wars in
computerdom.)  Apple started out with the "open" Apple ][ system.  Since
then, with the Mac and various iOS devices, Apple has been firmly closed,
and has increasingly tried to lock users into the Apple branded world.

With the iPod, and iTunes, Apple moved to control music, expanding somewhat
into movies, with extensions into podcasts (the very word deriving from the
iPod) and other audio and video content.  Then came Apple TV and Apple News.

With the recent "plus"es added to those, Apple has an enormous platform for
information, entertainment, infotainment, and all manner of content
delivery, all within the Apple environment and under Apple control.
Interest has been expressed in the medical benefits of the fitness tracker
on the Apple watch, with its ability to alert the user (or others) when
anomalous fitness readings are detected.  All of this, your phone and email
contacts and traffic, and many home IoT devices, can be controlled, managed,
recorded (and the details fed back to Apple) by Siri.  People have been
concerned over the information that Facebook and Google collect on users:
it's very difficult to believe that Apple has less access to personal user
data.

Buried in yesterday's announcement was the Apple credit card.  With its
enormous cash reserves, Apple can easily become a bank, and provide (and
manage) all kinds of financial services.

All Apple needs is a piece of Amazon's retail sector, and perhaps a
ride-sharing service (or, maybe, Apple might do an end-run, and start up a
drone-sharing telepresence service) and the Apple World+ is complete.  Many
science-fiction stories have posited a world where governments have become
irrelevant and been replaced by corporations: I suspect Apple is closest to
making this holistic control over the user's life a reality.

I expect iReligion+ to be announced any day.  Where others might go for the
cut-rate "Repent and be saved!  This is an exclusive TV offer" 20% off
salvation route, I presume Apple will for for the premium offer to save your
soul (backed up in the clouds) to an Apple branded heaven, with easy access
to forbidden fruit, as long as you only take one bite ...

  Zealand shooting -- and the humans who outsmarted its systems (RISKS-31.13)

If YouTube really wanted to be able to control the spread of video like
this, it would be simple.  They could simply shutdown uploads for a time,
until they can figure out how to screen the videos for the offensive
content.  Or they could, for a period of time, make it so uploads have to be
reviewed by a person before going live.  Obviously this would hinder other
people uploading to YouTube for a time.  However if they really wanted to
limit the rapid dissemination of certain videos, they could do so easily,
they just choose not to.

I guess this list is very familiar with these but in case not I have to
bring up Joseph Tainter here about the increasing cost of complexity (more
complex solutions solve previous complexity problems)

I also understand that the Stealth Bomber is such a complex shape that it
can only be flown by software.

It seems like the risk of something going wrong is not a risk but a
certainty?

Subject: Unproven declarations about healthcare (Re: Ward, RISKS-31.13)

Mr. Ward made a number of statements about for-profit businesses working in
healthcare that sound quite reasonable. I ask, are there studies to support
them?

For instance, "... the more sick people there are (especially those that
need expensive treatments), the more profit there is to be made." For the
same premiums, insurance companies *far* prefer healthy clients to sick
ones.

"Managing symptoms is more profitable than curing a disease;" Really?
Perhaps Big Pharma makes little on cough medicine, but has a tidy margin on
treatments for TB.

"Expensive drugs are more profitable than, for example, recommending simple
changes to diet ..." Sadly, few Americans follow recommendations to change
their diet. Americans *will* take pills.

"... encouraging unhealthy habits is beneficial to a healthcare company."
My insurance company and the mailers I get from hospitals and doctors all
encourage me to have healthy habits.

"... its a good business practice to test for everything ..." Much
over-testing is a reaction to massive litigation in the U.S. Doctors and
hospitals may be sued for millions if they ever fail to test for some rare
disease.

Government-run medicine is no panacea. The U.S. federal government has been
incredibly wasteful and has not always picked winners, for instance, the
Tuskegee Syphilis Study and the Enron scandal.

Not directly and not in and of itself.

In all things, there are factors which encourage, and there are factors
which discourage, and in the end, you get what you get.

I may be wrong, but I concur with the above description as *a* factor.

There are however *more* factors - a primary factor being competition: for
example, if a single entity offers cure, rather than symptom management,
they clean up the market, and on sane person will prefer a provider with
endless tests and symptom management over a few tests and a cure.

The extent to which competition is removed from the market, which can happen
through many means, such as absence of information for making choices, or
through State regulation constraining choice of provider (as happens in the
USA, through tax relief on employer provided health care) or, by being heavy
and onerous regulation, preventing new entry to market and so defending a
few large, existing, entrenched entities, the more the unpleasantness
Mr. Ward describes becomes less discouraged.

 > Contrast this with universal healthcare and government-funded medical
 > research.  If you are allocated with a certain budget per person and

The State obtains funding through taxation and creates a health care entity.
All patients -must- pay (taxation) and if the service is no good, there is
nowhere else for them to go, or, if private health care is permitted, they
must continue to pay anyway for State health care.

In all things there are factors which encourage, and factors which
discourage, and in the end, you get what you get : to be sure there will be
professionalism and human decency, both encouraging factors for positive
patient outcomes, but there will also be apathy, carelessness, inefficiency
and empire building, with no forces at work to remove them, for the really
profound encouraging factors, that the customer pays you and can go
somewhere else, are removed.  You then get what you get.

I may be wrong, but I think the great safety for normal, ordinary, powerless
people, is competition.  Safety lies in choice, which requires both the
freedom to buy as they wish and the freedom for there to *be* many different
providers to buy from.  Removal of one or both of these freedoms is an
encumbrance of serfdom.

Many evils come from ordinary people being constrained, such that they are
unable then to say "this is bloody awful, I'm leaving" and are instead
forced to endure.
