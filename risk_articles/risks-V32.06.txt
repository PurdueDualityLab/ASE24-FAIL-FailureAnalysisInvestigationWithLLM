daytime temps reportedly topped out at 106 degrees — and allegedly unplugged
the ventilator after not finding an open socket to cool down the room,
according to the report. Hospital staffers had deactivated air conditioners
in the unit in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19 []."

Subject: Ripple20 IP stack vulnerability may affect literally billion
  devices

Recently found vulnerability, called Ripple20. of an IP stack software
created by Treck, may literally affect billion devices.

The IP stack originally developed by Treck is meant for embedded devices and
runs on embedded OS, such as real-time OS.  It is also marketed by a
Japanese company Zuken Elmic after the joint development diverged.

Looking at the few advisories [1][2] and the original report by JSOF [3], an
Israeli company which first reported the vulnerability, one can't ignore the
fact that so many companies already published a list of devices affected by
the vulnerability.  HP and HP enterprise, for example, alone listed
printers, notebook and desktop PCs, and workstations.  I don't have the
marketing figure handy, but the list includes popular models and so I think
it could be millions of devices(?)  Finding names like Aruba, Cisco among
companies whose products are affected was a surprise to me. These companies
are known for the networking software. But they used third party network
stack for certain products, obviously.

As a matter of fact, I once used the early version of the stack from Elmic
(a Japanese company before it was bought by Zuken).  It was an old version
in the early 2000s I am a bit concerned since some partner companies used
the stack back then for prototyping.  At the time, it was one of the few IP
stacks for embedded devices that had the support of IPv6.

I am afraid the list of Japanese companies whose products are affected may
grow.  I suspect the response may be slow due to Covid-19 outbreak and many
people work from home. Zuken Elmic web page (in Japanese) claimed the stack,
marketed under the name of Kasago,  has been used by 300 companies for 500
different products.[5] Ouch.

The last years' Urgent/11 [4] was also bad, but Ripple20 may turn out to be
worse according to already reported products.

We may see more of these vulnerabilities in the future now that security
community turn its eyes toward embedded device domain.

Subject: E-Commerce Site Hackers Now Hiding Credit Card Stealer Inside Image
  Metadata (The Hacker News)

In what's one of the most innovative hacking campaigns, cybercrime gangs are
now hiding malicious code implants in the metadata of image files to
covertly steal payment card information entered by visitors on the hacked
websites.

"We found skimming code hidden within the metadata of an image file (a form
of steganography) and surreptitiously loaded by compromised online stores,"
Malwarebytes researchers said last week.
<https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/06/web-skimmer-hides-within-exif-metadata-exfiltrates-credit-cards-via-image-files/>

"This scheme would not be complete without yet another interesting variation
to exfiltrate stolen credit card data. Once again, criminals used the
disguise of an image file to collect their loot."

The evolving tactic of the operation, widely known as web skimming or a
Magecart attack, comes as bad actors are finding different ways to inject
JavaScript scripts, including misconfigured AWS S3 data

Subject: Moroccan Journalist Targeted With Network Injection Attacks
  Using NSO Groups Tools (Amnesty International)

Amnesty International, 22 June 2020

In October 2019 Amnesty International published a first report on the use of
spyware produced by Israeli company NSO Group against Moroccan human rights
defenders Maati Monjib and Abdessadak El Bouchattaoui. Through our continued
investigation, Amnesty International's Security Lab identified similar
evidence of the targeting of Omar Radi, a prominent activist and journalist
from Morocco from January 2019 until the end of January 2020.

Evidence gathered through our technical analysis of Omar Radi's iPhone
revealed traces of the same “network injection” attacks we described in our
earlier report that were used against Maati Monjib. This provides strong
evidence linking these attacks to NSO Group's tools.

These findings are especially significant because Omar Radi was targeted
just three days after NSO Group released its human rights policy. These
attacks continued after the company became aware of Amnesty International's
first report that provided evidence of the targeted attacks in Morocco. This
investigation thus, demonstrates NSO Group's continued failure to conduct
adequate human rights due diligence and the inefficacy of its own human
rights policy.

Subject: Netgear moves to plug vulnerability in routers after researchers
  find zero-day (Sean Lyngaas)

Sean Lyngaas, CyberScoop, 17 Jun, via ACM TechNews; Monday, June 29, 2020

Netgear said it is close to releasing a patch for a newly discovered
software vulnerability that could enable hackers to remotely exploit home
Internet routers and potentially access devices running on those networks.
The cybersecurity company GRIMM and Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI)
reported the vulnerability. GRIMM's Adam Nichols said his team detected a
vulnerable copy of a Web server on the router in 79 different Netgear
devices.  He noted that a hacker does not necessarily need to be on a Wi-Fi
network to launch an attack. Researchers said the vulnerability affects a
version of Netgear firmware dating to 2007. ZDI first reported the bug to
Netgear in January, delaying its analysis so Netgear could address the
issue.  It published its findings on June 15 to raise awareness after
Netgear requested multiple extensions for releasing a fix. Netgear said the
patch has been delayed by the pandemic.

Subject: TikTok and 53 other iOS apps STILL snoop your sensitive clipboard data
  (Ars Technica)

Passwords, bitcoin addresses, and anything else in clipboards are free for
the taking.

In March, researchers uncovered a troubling privacy grab by more than four
dozen iOS apps including TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media and
video-sharing phenomenon that has taken the Internet by storm. Despite
TikTok vowing to curb the practice, it continues to access some of Apple
users' most sensitive data, which can include passwords,
cryptocurrency wallet addresses, account-reset links, and personal
messages. Another 53 apps identified in March haven't stopped either.

The privacy invasion is the result of the apps repeatedly reading any text
that happens to reside in clipboards, which computers and other devices use
to store data that has been cut or copied from things like password
managers and email programs. With no clear reason for doing so, researchers
Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk found
<https://www.mysk.blog/2020/03/10/popular-iphone-and-ipad-apps-snooping-on-the-pasteboard/>,
the apps deliberately called an iOS programming interface that retrieves
text from users' clipboards.
Universal snooping

In many cases, the covert reading isn't limited to data stored on the local
device. In the event the iPhone or iPad uses the same Apple ID as other
Apple devices and are within roughly 10 feet of each other, all of them
share a universal clipboard <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209460>,
meaning contents can be copied from the app of one device and pasted into
an app running on a separate device.

That leaves open the possibility that an app on an iPhone will read
sensitive data on the clipboards of other connected devices. This could
include bitcoin addresses, passwords, or email messages that are
temporarily stored on the clipboard of a nearby Mac or iPad. Despite
running on a separate device, the iOS apps can easily read the sensitive
data stored on the other machines.

``It's very, very dangerous,'' Mysk said in an interview on Friday, referring
to the apps' indiscriminate reading of clipboard data. ``These apps are
reading clipboards, and there's no reason to do this. An app that doest
have a text field to enter text has no reason to read clipboard text.''

The video below demonstrates universal clipboard reading:  [...]

Subject: Zoom chats short circuit a brain function essential for trust --
  and that's bad for business (Don Pittis)

In-person encounters are crucial for establishing trust and building
successful teams, according to research Ever get the sense there is
something vital missing on those Zoom meetings? If so, you're not alone --
and there is Canadian science to back you up.

As political and business leaders push to reopen the economy hoping to get
restaurants, retailers and factories making money again, there may be good
economic reasons for putting at least some of the work-from-home crowd back
into the office as fast as it's safe to do so.

Canadian research on "computer-mediated communication," begun long before
the current lockdown, shows video chat is an inadequate substitute for
real-life interaction. The real thing, dependent on non-verbal cues, is
extraordinarily more effective in creating rapport and getting ideas across.

Subject: EFF & Heavyweight Legal Team Will Defend Internet Archive's Digital
  Library Against Publishers (Andy Maxwell)

Andy Maxwell, Torrent Freak,  Jun 26 2020 (via Dave Farber)
<https://torrentfreak.com/eff-heavyweight-legal-team-will-defend-internet-archives-digital-library-against-publishers-200626/>

The EFF has revealed it is teaming up with law firm Durie Tangri to defend
the Internet Archive against a lawsuit targeting its Open Library. According
to court filings, the impending storm is shaping up to be a battle of the
giants, with opposing attorneys having previously defended Google in book
scanning cases and won a $1bn verdict for the RIAA against ISP Cox.

In March and faced with the chaos caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the
Internet Archive (IA) launched its National Emergency Library (NEL)

Built on its existing Open Library, the NEL provided users with unlimited
borrowing of more than a million books, something which the IA hoped would
help *displaced learners* restricted by quarantine measures.

Publishers Sue Internet Archive

After making a lot of noise in opposition to both the Open and Emergency
libraries, publishers Hachette, HarperCollins, John Wiley and Penguin Random
House filed a massive copyright infringement lawsuit against the Internet
Archive.

Declaring the libraries little more than `pirate' services that have no
right to scan books and lend them out, even in a controlled fashion, the
publishers bemoaned the direct threat to their businesses and demanded
millions of dollars in statutory damages.

Earlier this month the IA announced the early closure of the NEL, with IA
founder Brewster Kahle calling for an end to litigation and the start of
cooperation. There are no public signs of either. Indeed, the opposing sides
are preparing for action.

EFF and Attorneys Team Up to Defend IA

Last evening the EFF announced that it is joining forces with
California-based law firm Durie Tangri to defend the Internet Archive
against a lawsuit which they say is a threat to IA's Controlled Digital
Lending (CDL) program.

The CDL program allows people to check out scanned copies of books for which
the IA and its partners can produce physically-owned copies. The publishers
clearly have a major problem with the system but according to IA and EFF,
the service is no different from that offered by other libraries.

``EFF is proud to stand with the Archive and protect this important public
service,'' says EFF Legal Director Corynne McSherry.  ``Controlled digital
lending helps get books to teachers, children and the general public at a
time when that is more needed and more difficult than ever. It is no threat
to any publisher's bottom line.''  [... PGN-truncated]

Subject: Re: 40 milliseconds to go halfway around the Earth?  *NOT*
  (Bacon, RISKS-32.05)

Today the "lie" travels around the globe in 40 milliseconds, and is
solidified by, and enhanced in, each retelling.

Hmmm.... 40 milliseconds = 4*10^-2 Speed of light... 3*10^8 meters/second
Distance in 40 msec = 12,000,000 meters (1.2*10^7) Circumference of the
Earth (pole to pole in meters) ~40,000,000 (4*10^7) Half way around the
world = 20,000,000 meters.  40 ms is really only about a quarter of the way
around the Earth -- at the speed of light!  Note that since radio can go all
directions you could perhaps cover half the Earth by going in all
directions.  HOWEVER, lies typically travel via Internet, where routers
typically slow things down considerably.  If you actually try to get packets
half way around the world (e.g., from California to Mumbai) you will find
that routing takes lots of additional time:

> traceroute mu.ac.in
traceroute to mu.ac.in (14.139.125.195), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
  1  10.0.2.1 (10.0.2.1)  0.513 ms  0.818 ms  0.793 ms
  2  192.168.1.254 (192.168.1.254)  2.539 ms  2.512 ms  2.486 ms
  3  162-200-148-1.lightspeed.mtryca.sbcglobal.net (162.200.148.1) 6.802
ms  7.207 ms  7.696 ms
  4  99.161.44.106 (99.161.44.106)  8.041 ms  8.533 ms  17.439 ms
  5  * * *
  6  12.83.47.137 (12.83.47.137)  19.002 ms  8.016 ms  8.152 ms
  7  sffca402igs.ip.att.net (12.122.114.29)  13.986 ms  15.078 ms 14.440 ms
  8  192.205.37.58 (192.205.37.58)  16.560 ms  16.911 ms  17.543 ms
  9  ae-9.r24.snjsca04.us.bb.gin.ntt.net (129.250.2.2)  15.533 ms 15.869
ms  24.884 ms
...

I should note that the "lie" (40ms) spread by RISKS got around the World
literally before I got my pants on this morning, and to get the truth out
will likely take days before it is even sent out by RISKS.

One more note. The lie also has to get from someone's brain (or some
mechanism's mechanism) and into someone (or something) else's brain
(mechanism), and while getting lies out may be pretty quick, penetrating the
brain to the point where the meme is formed in the recipient also takes
considerable time relative to 40ms.

Subject: Re: Smells Fishy? The Fish That Prevent Iran From Hacking
  Israel's Water System (RISKS-32.04)

Geoff Kuenning <geoff@cs.hmc.edu> brings up some very valid points.  Having
15 years experience in water/wastewaters controls (and by no means saying
his views are invalid in any way, they certainly are valid), I'd like to
point out that even in "major metropolitan areas", in the suburbs, the
amount of remote control over chlorine injection is often "none".  As a
matter of fact, a lot of operations prefer this, because if there's
something wrong, they WANT the operator on duty to go out and check the
station.  (Naturally, notification often comes via a SCADA system which has
stupidly poor security 99% of the time.  Sometimes notification comes when
the call center is flooded with angry calls from residents with bad water.)

That assumes there's even computerized control over chemical injection.
Most places, it's a simple pump, sitting on a chemical tank, that gets set
and left that way, until the flow changes.  If the flow is computer
controlled, the operator has the ability to remotely stop the well, assuming
that the relay-based hard logic mandated in (some) places doesn't stop the
out of control chemical injection, first.

It won't stop against a Stuxnet kind of attack (and I'm sure others I can't
think of, never mind just breaking into the station and turning the knob on
the pump up all the way), but it's some hope...Until something else comes
along that nobody thought of.

Years ago, a few vendors were offering systems that were basically
electronic fishtanks.  I don't think really anyone took the bait...
