Subject: Lahaina: single points of failure

High winds => downed power lines => sparked fires =>
melted water lines + pumping power loss => no way to fight the fires.

Reminds me of the 'Useless Box' that Turns Itself Off:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTilOsXBmU

Lahaina clearly demonstrates the Major Risk of *centralized electrical power
systems*; to gain resilience, we *have* to move to *distributed electrical
power systems*, aka 'microgrids':

https://www.nrel.gov/grid/microgrids.html

"Advanced microgrids enable local power generation assets&mdash;including
traditional generators, renewables, and storage&mdash;to keep the local grid
running even when the larger grid experiences interruptions or, for remote
areas, where there is no connection to the larger grid."

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/13/us/lahaina-water-failure.html

As Inferno Grew, Lahain's Water System Collapsed

Firefighters who rushed to contain the Maui wildfire found that hydrants
were running dry, forcing crews to embark instead on a perilous rescue
mission.

West Maui's water system relies on electrical power to pump water through
the network and deliver it to fire hydrants, and officials at Hawaiian
Electric, the state's main electrical utility, have said that the need to
maintain this pumping capability has made it difficult to shut off power
when high winds pose a fire risk.

``Pre-emptive, short-notice power shut-offs have to be coordinated with
first-responders and in Lahaina, electricity powers the pumps that provide
the water needed for firefighting,'' said Jim Kelly, a spokesman for the
utility.

  [Re: the sirens, discussed in an earlier RISKS issue, I heard a news
  report faulting officials that the sirens were not used.  The rebuttal
  justification seemed to be that their use was primarily for tsunamis, for
  which people are trained to move inland higher altitudes as fast as
  possible -- which may not have been relevant here.  PGN]

 wreaking havoc (Ars Technica)

Windows Secure Time Seeding resets clocks months or years off the correct
time.

A few months ago, an engineer in a data center in Norway encountered some
perplexing errors that caused a Windows server to suddenly reset its system
clock to 55 days in the future. The engineer relied on the server to
maintain a routing table that tracked cell phone numbers in real time as
they moved from one carrier to the other. A jump of eight weeks had dire
consequences because it caused numbers that had yet to be transferred to be
listed as having already been moved and numbers that had already been
transferred to be reported as pending.  [...]

https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/san-francisco-robotaxi-traffic-jam-1.6=
938440

The day after California approved an expansion of driverless taxis, 10 of
them came to a grinding halt on a busy San Francisco street, creating a
gridlock that encompassed several blocks.

The culprit? A music festival.

"Cell phones were overwhelmed, and as a result, they were not able to take
control of these cars -- which is a pretty frightening systemic defe= ct,"

Aaron Peskin, president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors (SFBV),
told As It Happens guest host Paul Hunter.

Not only was there the 10-car back-up of Cruise-owned autonomous taxis in
city's North Shore neighbourhood on Friday, but on the other side of the
city, closer to the Outside Lands music festival, Peskin said "there were
also scores of them that came to a grinding halt."

Subject: Not AI?

I know it's difficult to stop a media trend once it has begun but there is
no current functionally complete AI available.  I propose the counter
inflamatory term *Dijkstra's demon*.  The underlying algorithms that drive
LLMs are essentially pathfinders.  Instead of connecting points for paths,
they connect glyphs to form new glyphs (to borrow a term from Hofstadter)
Comparing a LLM to a less than ideal way of connecting two subjects is a
more accurate model to work from than the popular construction of a
"thinking" machine.

Also, in my non-legal opinion, start reserving derivative works in any of
your statement of work negotiations. ChatGPT is almost entirely unusable
now because it doesn't have a provenance for what it's spitting out.
Now that you ask, yes, I am in fact in an armchair.

Subject: Crypto smart contracts still stupid (Amy Castor)

Curve: smart contracts, stupid humans

"Smart contracts" are small programs that run right there inside a
blockchain. In enterprise computing, these would be called "database
triggers" or "stored procedures."

You never use triggers or stored procedures unless you absolutely have to,
because they're very easy to get wrong and a pain in the backside to
debug. In the real world, you keep your financial data and the programs
working on it separate.

So, of course, crypto uses programs embedded in the database for everything
and touts the difficulty in working with them as a feature and not evidence
of the idea's incredible stupidity.

A smart contract full of crypto can reasonably be treated as a piata, just
waiting for you to whack it in the right spot and get the candy.

Today's piñata is Curve Finance, a DeFi exchange used for trading
stablecoins and other tokens. Curve was hacked on July 30 due to a bug in
the Vyper language compiler. Smart contracts that were using Vyper versions
0.2.15, 0.2.16, and 0.3.0 were vulnerable. About $70 million in funds was
drained from liquidity pools whose smart contracts used these
versions. [Twitter, archive; Twitter, archive]

Vyper, which is inspired by Python, was supposed to have been an improvement
over the hilariously awful Solidity -- a.k.a. "JavaScript with a concussion"
-- that most Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contracts are written
in. Unfortunately, the Vyper compiler had a bug that meant compiled code was
exploitable. So you could mathematically prove your smart contract program
was correct # and the compiled version could still be exploited. This could
hit any Vyper smart contract using vulnerable versions. [Twitter, archive]

cities in more than 100 countries around the world, Cloudflare has
visibility into these types of attacks that's shared by only a handful of
other companies. The company said it delivers more than 63 million network

"Ukrainian cops have disrupted a massive bot farm with more than 100
operators allegedly spreading fake news about the Russian invasion, leaking
personal information belonging to Ukrainian citizens, and instigating fraud
schemes.

After conducting 21 searches, the country's cyber and national police seized
computer equipment, mobile phones, more than 250 GSM gateways, and about
150,000 SIM cards.

"The Cyber Police established that the attackers used special equipment and
software to register thousands of bot accounts in various social networks
and subsequently launch advertisements that violated the norms and
legislation of Ukraine," according to machine translation of the news alert
issued by the police.

Insiders in Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia, and Lviv were involved in the bot farm,

Subject: Imposter scams are the top U.S. fraud (NPR)

A 3-hour phone call that brought her to tears: Imposter scams cost Americans
billions

Valeria Haedo, a visual artist based in New York City, was caught off guard
when she was targeted in a complex phone scam.

It was a Monday in the middle of the day when Valeria Haedo got a phone call
from a number she didn't recognize. She doesn't normally pick those up, but
she did that day. The caller said his name was Officer Robert Daniels from
U.S. Customs and Border Protection and he had a warrant for her arrest.

He told Haedo she could verify him by Googling his name and department. She
did, and it checked out. But what Haedo didn't realize in that moment is
she'd just been targeted in an intricate scam. She was kept on the phone for
more than three hours and eventually brought to tears.

The scam is known as an imposter scam and is the top fraud in the U.S. right
now. It involves the perpetrator impersonating an authority figure and using
scare tactics to reel in victims. While these scams have been around
forever, they've become more believable because con artists use real names
of law enforcement officers that show up with caller ID from an actual
office and even local accents.  [...]

A 2021 ransomware breach at Gigabyte reportedly compromised more than 112

widely-used baseboard management controllers (BMC) processors on system
boards.

The exposed defects reportedly include zero-day and code execution

  I have long advocated connecting to BMC and similar control interfaces
