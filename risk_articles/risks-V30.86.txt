Subject: Doctors are surprisingly bad at reading lab results.  It's putting

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/10/05/feature/doctors-are-surprisingly-bad-at-reading-lab-results-its-putting-us-all-at-risk

Physicians make mistakes interpreting lab results, assessing diagnostic
images, prescribing medicine, etc. These errors can portend either a fatal
outcome or expensive mitigation based on the incorrect assessment of patient
symptoms, history, and diagnostic evidence.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the US Health and
Human Services estimated in 2014 that 5% of outpatients experience
misdiagnosis, and 13% of emergency room patients are misdiagnosed for stroke
(see https://psnet.ahrq.gov/perspectives/perspective/169/diagnostic-errors).

As AI-based assistance -- robo-medicine -- encroaches on medical
specializations, a significant risk arises from the training reference input
data used to construct these platforms. The risk materializes from the
who/what that arbitrates between "correct" and "incorrect" or "pass" and
"fail" machine-generated diagnostic conclusions and therapeutic
recommendations. Physicians will be challenged to justify and pursue
robo-medicine's diagnostic findings and therapeutic recommendations based on
a "probably approximately correct learning" technique.

Robo-medicine viability depends on the input training data used to construct
the core decision engine, the artificial life or neural network framework
that is constructed to generate a presumably viable diagnosis based on
patient symptoms, physiological data, and history.  That physicians make
mistakes assessing this information implies that the machine training
stimulus input and output inherits and partially acquires human judgment,
however imperfect.

Without physician intervention, an automatic patient diagnostic/treatment
life cycle consisting of pre-existing and chronic conditions, blood/urine
chemistry, diagnostic image analysis, surgical robots (robots with knives),
and prescription generators comprises a future medical-industrial ecosystem
that can amplify misdiagnosis frequency and severity. Without independent
and continuous monitoring, reporting and correction, medical error cluster
formation is a likely outcome. A proactive and concurrent maintenance and
oversight life cycle is imperative to mitigate emergent risks.

Accountability and traceability must remain with the physician in charge of
patient care. It would be irresponsible and dangerous, though possibly
cost-effective, to allow robo-medicine dispensation without physician
oversight. Publication of patient life cycle experience, including automated
misdiagnosis and maltreatment incidents, is essential to enable independent
analysis. How to achieve this reporting, and preserve patient
confidentiality, privacy, and anonymity poses a significant and sustained
challenge.

Procedures are required to govern robo-medicine's therapeutic analysis,
findings and recommendations. A misdiagnosis or incorrect therapy schedule
must be quickly reported to the FDA's MAUDE repository. An unrecognized and
unchallenged diagnostic or therapeutic defect escape in a hospital emergency
room may be catastrophic.

As technological risk multiples in the medical-industrial complex, elevated
financial and legal penalties against suppliers are needed to deter
irresponsible product deployment. Robo-medicine platforms must be
indemnification-exempt should a physician initiate suspect, incorrect, or
life-threatening therapeutic recommendations and procedures.  Mandatory peer
consultation is a requirement.

If the medical-industrial complex sustains caveat emptor (buyer beware) as
their business model, independent and conflict-free reviewers of product
viability and effectiveness becomes mandatory. Robo-medicine manufacturing
and qualification processes for software and hardware must become
transparent.

Consumer trust and confidence accrues from evidence that sponsors it, not
marketing or propaganda. Compulsory reporting of unvarnished defect escape
of misdiagnosis and questionable therapeutic recommendations are necessary
to reveal robo-medicine's defects. Regulatory governance, enforcement, and
vigilance must strengthen to improve patient outcome and suppress the
accelerated misdiagnosis potential of robo-medicine.

Subject: Chinese chip spying report shows the supply chain remains the
  ultimate weakness (TechCrunch)

via NNSquad
https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/04/china-spy-hack-chip-bloomberg-supply-chain/

  Thursday's explosive story by Bloomberg reveals detailed allegations that
  the Chinese military embedded tiny chips into servers, which made their
  way into datacenters operated by dozens of major U.S. companies.  We
  covered the story earlier, including denials by Apple, Amazon and
  Supermicro -- the server maker that was reportedly targeted by the Chinese
  government. Amazon said in a blog post that it "employs stringent security
  standards across our supply chain." The FBI and the Office for the
  Director of National Intelligence did not comment, but denied comment to
  Bloomberg.

An interesting story, but aspects of it don't seem to ring quite true.  I'll
mention one odd aspect right now. Why would you build such capabilities into
a separate chip that could ultimately be noticed as extraneous -- even if
camouflaged as another sort of chip -- rather than build this capability
into a chip that already was expected to be present and would never attract
any attention at all? My hype detector is buzzing a bit on this saga.

  [This may be just the beginning of a long saga.  Discussions over the past
  few days have been very contentious, with many different possible
  outcomes.  For example, Peter Houppermans noted these:
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies
Apple is clearly not happy with Bloomberg, and refutes the story:

Subject: Chipping away at the spy business ...

I started out, more than 30 years ago, researching malware and other forms of
covert interference (including a number of instances involving hardware). While
the possibility of a hardware attack similar to this is quite possible, the
details of this story are quite suspect.

(First of all, I note that Faux News is interested.  That *automatically*
raises alarms  :-)

There is the issue that this relates to a separate chip found on the circuit
boards.  If you are smart enough to make a chip that can do everything this
superchip is supposed to do, you should be smart enough to put the functions
into another chip on the the system (perhaps the system management controller
that the superchip is supposed to control) so that an extraneous chip won't
raise alarms.

Then there are all the functions this superchip is supposed to do.  It is
supposed to manage communications.  It is supposed to subvert the operating
system.  (*Which* operating system?  How would they know that would be the
one used?)  It is supposed to divert password checks.

Oh, right.  It's supposed to subvert the system controller.  I once reviewed
a supposed antiviral system that Western Digital used as a demonstration of
their new system controller chip.  They made a total hash of it.  Even
system controllers don't have the kind of reference monitor function that
this superchip would rely on.

Other parts of the story refer to other chips, some as small as a pencil
tip, that could be layered into the circuit board itself.  Yes, it could.
But how would you make contacts with it?  (And you'd need multiple contacts
...)

While the spy parts of the story sound reasonable, the tech parts don't.
Now, it may be that there are similar types of hardware attacks mounted.  It
may even be that almost the whole story it true, but that the "sources" lied
to Bloomberg about the tech for reasons of their own.  But this smacks, to
me, of the tale of the Desert Storm Virus of 1991.  An April Fools joke that
deceived the author of a book about the 1991 Desert Storm campaign -- and
also the Pentagon press office.  (Because they'd read the book ...)

Subject: "The one serious MacBook Pro security flaw that nobody is talking
  about" (David Gewirtz)

David Gewirtz for ZDNet, 3 Oct 2018
The one serious MacBook Pro security flaw that nobody is talking about
Every MacBook since 2015 and every MacBook Pro since 2016 is at risk.
Here's how you can keep your machines safe.

selected text:

With my 2015 MacBook equipped with a MagSafe port, if I want to charge the
machine, I just plug it in. There's no risk of a data connection. As long as
I have networking off and nothing plugged into any of my ports, I'm
safe. I'm air-gapped from the rest of the world.

MacBooks before 2015 and MacBook Pros before 2016 could charge without any
risk, as long as everything else was off, empty, or disconnected.  Prior to
the USB C-only MacBook Pros, at least charging the device wasn't a possible
hacking vector.  But with the MacBook from 2015 on, and for the MacBook Pros
from 2016 on, the only way you can charge the notebook is by connecting to a
USB-C port.

That's right. In order to charge the machine, you must connect to a port
capable of transferring data. You have no choice.

Subject: Lapses in IT systems, organisations must be fixed (P.M. Lee)

P.M. Lee, Straits Times

The public post-mortem following Singapore's largest data breach in its 53
year old history finds that certain IT governance and deployment practices
require redress. This breach rattled the city-state.
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coi-on-singhealth-cyber-attack-alarm-bells-did-not-ring-for-key-cyber-security-employee

Among the recommendations from the "four-member Committee of Inquiry"
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/failings-in-judgement-organisation-exposed-as-cyber-attack-coi-grills-singhealth-risk-man
is adoption of the "Singapore Government Technology Stack" (SGTS) to enable
"cheaper and faster" e-service roll-out. The SGTS contents is TBD.

If a stack's publication viability (fitness to release for deployment)
possesses an attribute governing "Trust" qualification, it must be shown to
be immune/hardened against surreptitious access, and generate non-repudiated
results, etc. The "Trust" attribute needs to be applied across the full
ecosystem (including the carbon components), not just the SGTS, as the
weakest security link is the easiest to penetrate, and often requires the
broadest mitigations/countermeasures to harden.

Metasploit cleanliness, OWASP.org compliance, and fuzz stimulus evaluation
findings can contribute to trust qualification measurement by revealing
vulnerabilities to prioritize for repair prior to deployment.

Since the NSA's TOA toolset was involuntarily published, perhaps it should
be applied as a "kitchen sink" qualification tool for SGTS?

Subject: Fitbit data used to charge US man with murder (BBC)

https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45745366

  Fitbit data has been used by US police investigating whether a 90-year-old
  murdered his stepdaughter.  The victim, Karen Navarra, 67, was found with
  a kitchen knife in her hand, suggesting she killed herself.  Anthony
  Aiello, who denies murder, told police he had visited her for 15 minutes
  to drop off pizza.  But police say a fitness tracker she was wearing
  showed a significant spike in heart rate followed by a rapid slowdown at
  the time he was there.  [...]

  It is not the first time Fitbit data has been used in a murder case.  Last
  year in the US, Richard Dabate was charged with murdering his wife after
  data from her Fitbit discredited his version of events, according to
  police.  Mr Dabate had said he had seen his wife, Connie, shot by an
  intruder more than an hour before her fitness tracker had recorded her
  last movements, they said.

I've never seen or used one of these devices, but this makes me wonder: Must
a user authenticate to one before it becomes active? How hard would it be to
"borrow", say, a roommate's or significant other's Fitbit and use it as part
of a scheme to frame him or her for a crime?

I remember a story from some time back about a woman who looked at her
boyfriend's Fitbit (or some other similar device) data, and concluded that
he had been unfaithful due to it having recorded him "in the act", having
sex with someone else. So it may not be difficult to extract data from
them. But what about changing the contents of its memory?

So I can imagine a plot for a story: Woman discovers, after examining Fitbit
data, that husband has been cheating. She murders her rival, and uses the
Fitbit to frame him for the crime. (Insert optional surprise ending: maybe
someone framed him in the first place, or a friend had borrowed his Fitbit
to try it out, and it was all a big mistake, but she learns this too late,
or maybe she has to confess to the murder to save him, or ???)

Elevated upper-atmospheric CO2 levels preserve longevity of orbiting space
junk, elevating collision potential between orbiting satellites.

"In all, according to the ESA, there have been about 5,400 rocket launches
since the space age began in 1957. They have placed about 8,650 satellites
in orbit. Of these, about 4,700 are still in space, but only around 1,800
are still functioning. Space surveillance networks operated by the United
States, Europe and other nations now estimate there are some 29,000 pieces
of debris that are 10 centimeters in diameter or larger in orbit. Not all of

"The DEA launched its National License Plate Reader Program in 2008; it was
publicly revealed for the first time during a congressional hearing four
years after that. The DEA's most recent budget describes the program as 'a
federation of independent federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement
license plate readers linked into a cooperative system, designed to enhance
the ability of law enforcement agencies to interdict drug traffickers, money
launderers or other criminal activities on high drug and money trafficking
corridors and other public roadways throughout the U.S.,' primarily along
the southwest border region, and the country's northeast and southeast
corridors.

"There used to be an old police saying, 'If you robbed a bank, please drive
carefully,' former NYPD Detective Sergeant and Bronx Cold Case Squad
commander Joseph Giacalone told Quartz, explaining that if a getaway driver
didn't do anything to attract the attention of police and get pulled over,
they usually had a half-decent chance of fleeing. 'But that's no longer in
effect because you can drive slow, you can stop at every red light, but
these license plate readers and surveillance cameras track your every
movement."

Subject: Molecule resonance and cellphone radiation (Stein, RISKS-30.85)

Richard Stein wrote that cellphone frequencies are far too low to cause
ionization.  He notes that cellphone radiation in the microwave frequency
could cause a small amount of warming.  That cellphone EM radiation does not
ionize is a red herring.  He neglects the affect of resonance with
biological molecules.  As far as I know, no dangerous resonances have been
identified, but the possibility cannot be entirely discounted.

Subject: Declaration of Internet Rights -- Italian Parliament

  [via dave farber]

I find the declaration intriguing, but I fear that it will be unable to
launch, much less fly, because it is too heavily laden with contentious
issues (such as the right to be forgotten - which, by-the-way, I support).

For more than a decade I have been advocating a rather shorter formulation
that I believe is an initial step that can be more easily reached.  This
formulation is, of course, in need of interpretation in order to sharpen the
distinctions that it makes.

First Law of the Internet

https://www.cavebear.com/old_cbblog/000059.html

 + Every person shall be free to use the Internet in any way that
   is privately beneficial without being publicly detrimental.

    - The burden of demonstrating public detriment shall be on those who
      wish to prevent the private use.

    - Such a demonstration shall require clear and convincing evidence of
      public detriment.

    - The public detriment must be of such degree and extent as to justify
      the suppression of the private activity.

(By-the-way, I got the ideas for this out of the old 1954 Hush-A-Phone
decision and some of the subsequent cases, such as Carterphone and MIC, that
tried to define the boundary between what was then a monolithic and
intensely controlling "the telephone company" and users who wanted to do
more than simply talk.)

That's for all SB vehicles. What happens if we segregate the statistics by
manufacturer? Are *any* of those fatalities due to Waymo vehicles? I haven't
tried a full statistical analysis, but what I remember from newspaper
reports is that at least 2 of those 3 are from Uber's SB Vehicles, not from
Waymo. This would _tend to_ suggest that Waymo is more careful than Uber in
designing their hardware/software systems to avoid accidents. And in testing
their vehicles: Waymo had SB vehicles "driving" around with a human (CB) in
the car to take over in case of emergency.

Unfortunately, given the numbers in Stein's posting, that would leave a
sample size way too small. At least if we insist on measuring only
fatalities.

I remember this arising a couple of years ago when I was reading analyses in
the newspapers, that said that fatal accidents were so rare (1.2 per million
VMT per the NHTSA figures Stein quotes) that it would take a long time to
accumulate enough VMTs on SB vehicles to know if they were "safe enough". I
was skeptical then, and I remain skeptical.  You don't have to count only
fatalities, because fatalities correlate positively* with (1) non-fatal
injuries, and (2) non-injury collisions.

So if we look at injury accidents per 1E8 VMT for SB  vs. CB "drivers", we
should get a pretty good idea of whether SB "drivers" are better or worse
than CB drivers.

* Not necessarily proportionally, although I suspect that fatalities are
  proportional to non-fatal injuries.
