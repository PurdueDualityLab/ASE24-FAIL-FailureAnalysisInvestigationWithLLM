Subject: Hundreds of Flights Into Britain Canceled After úÙÚ¯Technical IssueúÙÚ˘

Airlines were forced to cancel hundreds of flights and delay hundreds more
on Monday after BritainúÙÚ˘s air traffic control service experienced a
*technical issue* that caused widespread disruption on one of the
countryúÙÚ˘s busiest travel days of the year.

More than 200 flights departing from Britain were canceled, according to
Cirium, the aviation analytics company, along with 271 that were scheduled
to arrive in the country on Monday. Many other flights would be delayed by
more than eight hours, úÙÚ¸which will inevitably result in a cancellation,úÙÚ˝
Cirium added.

NATS, BritainúÙÚ˘s National Air Traffic Service, said a technical problem had
affected its ability to automatically process flight plans, which meant
that the information had to be entered manually, slowing down the process.

Subject: 5,000 pilots suspected of hiding major health issues. Most are
 still flying.  (WashPost)

Federal authorities have been investigating nearly 5,000 pilots suspected of
falsifying their medical records to conceal that they were receiving
benefits for mental health disorders and other serious conditions that could
make them unfit to fly, documents and interviews show.

The pilots under scrutiny are military veterans who told the Federal
Aviation Administration that they are healthy enough to fly, yet failed to
report úÙÚÙ as required by law úÙÚÙ that they were also collecting veterans
benefits for disabilities that could bar them from the cockpit.

Veterans Affairs investigators discovered the inconsistencies more than two
years ago by cross-checking federal databases, but the FAA has kept many
details of the case a secret from the public.  [...]

Subject: AI Brings the Robot Wingman to Aerial Combat (The New York Times)

An Air Force program shows how the Pentagon is starting to embrace the
potential of a rapidly emerging technology, with far-reaching implications
for war-fighting tactics, military culture and the defense industry.

It is powered into flight by a rocket engine. It can fly a distance equal to
the width of China. It has a stealthy design and is capable of carrying
missiles that can hit enemy targets far beyond its visual range.

But what really distinguishes the Air ForceúÙÚ˘s pilotless XQ-58A Valkyrie
experimental aircraft is that it is run by artificial intelligence, putting
it at the forefront of efforts by the U.S. military to harness the
capacities of an emerging technology whose vast potential benefits are
tempered by deep concerns about how much autonomy to grant to a lethal
weapon.  [...]

The Pentagon has a miserable record on building advanced software and trying
to start its own artificial intelligence program. Over the years, it has
cycled through various acronym-laden program offices that are created and
then shut down with little to show.

Subject: Security, Social or routing?

I got a call "from Social Security".

Or was it?

The call was from a local Maryland {301} prefix. (That number belongs to
Envoy, a telecom carrier I'm aware of.) But she wants my data (SSN, etc.)
before she'll talk & I want proof of her status before... Mexican Standoff.

She suggested I call my local office to verify she is an employee.  She gave
me her "800" number, and a ten-digit (!) extension. {The extension's first 3
digits were an N00, ergo not a valid NPA {area code}.

Now SSA has a web page, and I have more faith in DNS et.al than easily
forged CNID. That page says their main number is 800-772-1213. If I look up
my local SSA office, I get told a third 800 number, not a local number
there, nor the one she had given me. Hmmm.

So I called 800-772-1213, and waited 50 minutes. Then the human there told
me she was an employee and confirmed her name and 10-digit extension. Turns
out she works in a Denver facility BUT he could not transfer me.

So I called the Envoy number, got an auto attendant. Entered the 10D
extension she had given me, and got her voicemail. She called back a day
later, same Envoy number, same voice. FINALLY, we could discuss the question
at hand.

How hard would it be for attackers to use some BGP'ish attack to divert a
slew of inbound VOIP-carried calls to them?

I'm no crypto expert [I can spell 'PGP'...], but would tools such as
offering "the sum of the first 3 digits", "Consonant, vowel, vowel,
consonant" for a place of birth etc. be safer/safe enough?

úÙÚ¸Reflections on Trusting TrustúÙÚ˝ came to mind. How should an 'average
Jill/Joe' have any confidence that it *is* SSA calling?  Granted SSA must
have a huge phone system, and given Federal procurement regs, it is divvied
up between multiple vendors, but should the core security be the 1213 number
they dial, when it won't get you where you need to be, 50 minutes later?

May we live in interesting times.

Subject: The decline of social media

When you really think about it, a fundamental reason why most social
media seems to have turned into an increasingly painful chore rather
than a joy to be anticipated, is that on most platforms they have
devolved into advertising, group and self-promotion, and commercial
content delivery systems (and worse) -- rather than venues to engage
in polite discussion with other individuals about areas of common
interest. In many cases, they've quite obviously degraded from happy
serendipity to abysmal stupidity. That's just the reality. -L

Subject: Prescription drug ads on TV

Advertising of prescription drugs on television is an absolute travesty,
drives viewers nuts, and makes doctors' jobs even more difficult. The
decision to permit these ads at the behest of Big Pharma was one of the
worst ever.

The list of side effects in many TV prescription drug ads starts to
sound like a Monty Python script, especially when they include
completely OPPOSITE effects in the same list that goes on and on and
on. "Do not take if you or anyone in your immediate family suffers
from Dyatical Frombolini's Syndrome A-4Z031B3 or are allergic to
giraffes."

Subject: Kia and Hyundai Helped Enable a Crime Wave. They
 Should Pay for It  (*The New York Times*)

In a recent analysis of data from 37 American cities, the Council on
Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, suggested a hopeful trend úÙÚÙ the
pandemic-era spike in crime may have peaked. The homicide rate has dropped
significantly over the last year, based on data from 30 American cities. In
many places, just about all types of violent crimes are down, in some areas
substantially úÙÚÙ in Atlanta, for instance, there have been 21 percent fewer
aggravated assaults, 28 percent fewer homicides and 56 percent fewer rapes
than at this point in 2022, according to police department data.

But thereúÙÚ˘s a glaring exception: auto thefts. According to the Council on
Criminal Justice, úÙÚ¸The number of vehicle thefts during the first half of
2023 was 33.5 percent higher, on average, than during the same period in
2022 úÙÚÙ representing 23,974 more vehicle thefts in the cities that reported
data.úÙÚ˝ In Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Chicago, New Orleans, Buffalo and
Durham, N.C., motor vehicle thefts this year have more than doubled relative
to last year, according to stats collected by Jeff Asher, a crime data
analyst. This week, The Baltimore Sun reported that úÙÚ¸auto thefts are on pace
to more than double the total from last year, as reports through the first
eight months of 2023 are already up 88 percent compared to all of 2022.úÙÚ˝

Why are so many cars getting stolen? Police departments and city officials
point to this: Millions of Kias and Hyundais are ridiculously easy to steal.

Subject: Food delivery robots under attack from vandals, thieves (YouTube)

The popularity of remote food delivery skyrocketed during the COVID-19
pandemic, and the trend has continued to help businesses thrive years
later. Unfortunately, some of the robotic delivery vehicles are taking a
beating, with several viral videos showing people kicking the autonbots over
and even stealing the products inside.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3C_rpUTYuk

I saw food delivery robots years ago on George Mason University campus.  I
saw a student chasing one for his order because he forgot to update his
address so the robot wasn't going to where he lived.

That video is amazing -- worst interviewers I've seen. Inarticulate and just
dumb. After being told the robots travel seven miles per hour, newsdroidette
commented that it would take an hour to deliver a mile away.

Subject: Tesla owners are angry about buying their vehicles
 right before the latest big price cuts and are letting Elon
 Musk know: I feel completely duped.  (Finance)

When Tesla slashes prices, as it did this week, shoppers looking for
electric vehicles generally benefit. But for anyone who buys a Tesla right
before such price cuts, the frustration can be acute. Waiting just a little
longer to buy, after all, could have saved them a significant amount of
moneyúÙÚÙbut they had no way of knowing.

A risk for Elon MuskúÙÚ˘s carmaker, which has repeatedly cut prices on its
high-end models this year, is that existing customers will feel
resentmentúÙÚÙnot to mention see their vehicle lose valueúÙÚÙwhile some shoppers
hesitate to buy because another price cut might be right around the corner.

After the carmaker made its latest price cuts on Thursday, new Tesla owners
vented their frustration on social media, often addressing Musk in posts on
X (formerly Twitter), the social network he owns.

One tweet posted on Friday reads: úÙÚ¸Tesla screws with people so much when
they drop price by $20k+. I just picked up my Model S Plaid one day ago,
drove less than 100 miles on it and I'm shafted by over $20k. TESLA NEVER
AGAIN.úÙÚ˝
