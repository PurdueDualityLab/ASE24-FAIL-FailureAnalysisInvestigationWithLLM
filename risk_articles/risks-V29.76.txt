Subject: GM recalls 4M cars because of a software fault

*The Financial Times* reports today that GM is recalling 4.3-million cars,
SUVs, and trucks built from 2014 onwards because of a software fault that
causes sensors to fail to detect a crash "in rare circumstances when a
vehicle was moving in a certain way before the impact". It would be
interesting to know whether it was an error in the specification, the design
or the coding, what assurance methods would have prevented or detected the
fault, and whether any changes have been made to GM's (or its supplier's)
software development processes as a result.

``A flight from Sydney to Malaysia ended up in Melbourne after the captain
incorrectly entered the plane's location in its navigation system just
before take-off, according to a safety investigation.  The AirAsia X flight
took off from Sydney Airport just before noon on March 10 last year, heading

  pilot error (CNN)

http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/07/aviation/airasia-melbourne-malaysia-error/

... When manually entering the coordinates of the plane's position, the
pilot incorrectly entered the longitude from a sign outside the cockpit
window as 01519.8 east (15 degrees 19.8 minutes east) instead of 15109.8
east (151 degrees 9.8 minutes east), the report said.  "This resulted in a
positional error in excess of 11,000 kilometers (6,835 miles), which
adversely affected the aircraft's navigation systems and some alerting
systems," the report said.

http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/08/technology/delta-airline-computer-failure/

The crew had "a number of opportunities to identify and correct the error,"
the report said, but didn't notice the problem until after the plane became
airborne and started tracking in the wrong direction.  Several message
alerts and sounds suggested the error before takeoff, but the crew ignored
them, according to the report.

Once the captain and the first officer realized the mistake, they tried to
fix the system.  But it was too late.

"Attempts to troubleshoot and rectify the problem resulted in further
degradation of the navigation system, as well as to the aircraft's flight
guidance and flight control system," the report said.

As systems failed further, the crew asked to return to Sydney and conduct a
landing without the use of navigation systems. However, weather conditions
in Sydney forced the plane to land in Melbourne instead...

via NNSquad
http://www.wcti12.com/news/5300-wells-fargo-employees-fired-for-creating-millions-of-phony-accounts/74912454

  On Thursday, federal regulators said Wells Fargo employees secretly
  created millions of unauthorized bank and credit card accounts -- without
  their customers knowing it -- since 2011.  The phony accounts earned the
  bank unwarranted fees and allowed Wells Fargo employees to boost their
  sales figures and make more money.  "Wells Fargo employees secretly opened
  unauthorized accounts to hit sales targets and receive bonuses," Richard
  Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said in a
  statement.  Wells Fargo confirmed to CNNMoney that it had fired 5,300
  employees related to the shady behavior over the last few years. Employees
  went to far as to create phony PIN numbers and fake email addresses to
  enroll customers in online banking services, the CFPB said.

Subject: Phoenix Pay System Disaster Leads to Real Tears

In 2009 the then Conservative government of Canada decided to consolidate
all public service pay administration in one location with one large system.
(Conservatives and Liberals are actual political parties in Canada.) The
system was to replace the pay advisors in the various departments with
skills peculiar to the various union agreements and work practices in force
with 550 personnel in Miramichi, New Brunswick.  In 2011 a contract was let
to build the system.  Meanwhile the expert pay advisors mostly declined to
move to Miramichi.  One can see the scene for a disaster being set.

After some delay, part of the system was rolled out in February of this year
(2016) by the newly elected Liberal government.  It functioned badly, i.e.,
people were underpaid, overpaid, or not paid at all.

Despite obvious problems and justified protests from the unions the system
was rolled out further to cover 2/3 of the public service in April 2016.  At
the same time the old system was decommissioned.

Now, at the beginning of September, public servants who have not been paid
are having to get loans, cash in retirement savings, live day to day, and
face tax problems.

The present additional costs for "fixing" the system are estimated at
$50,000,000 and the end is not really in sight.

http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/phoenix-ottawa-timeline-1.3691812

  Norman Augustine's phrase about disaster not having been left to chance
  fits perfectly.

When renewing my passport last month I casually asked the passport officer
when he had last been paid - 9 weeks ago was the answer.

I did not bother to catalog all the mis-steps in the process because I am
certain that RISKS readers are preternaturally fitted to fill in the blanks.

Proposed legislation could make alerts of traffic blitzes and radars illegal

selected text:

Traffic and navigation app Waze could face trouble in Brazil as proposed
legislation could make tools that enable alerts of traffic blitzes and speed
radars illegal.  By connecting drivers to each other, Google-owned Waze
allows motorists to warn one another of car crashes and traffic backups, but
also if there are police officers or radars nearby.

The debate on whether the public can monitor the police and to what extent
this can be done grabbed the headlines late last year, when Los Angeles
police chief Charlie Beck wrote a public statement linking the killings of
two New York police officers to Waze use by the shooter at some point before
the crime.

Writing to Google chief executive Larry Page, Beck says that Waze "poses a
danger to the lives of police officers in the United States."

The company has since responded, saying that "police partners support Waze
and its features, including reports of police presence, because most users
tend to drive more carefully when they believe law enforcement is nearby."

  Snatching the login credentials of a locked computer just got easier and
  faster, thanks to a technique that requires only $50 worth of hardware and
  takes less than 30 seconds to carry out.  Rob Fuller, a principal security
  engineer at R5 Industries, said the hack works reliably on Windows devices
  and has also succeeded on OS X, although he's working with others to
  determine if it's just his setup that's vulnerable.  The hack works by
  plugging a flash-sized minicomputer into an unattended computer that's
  logged in but currently locked.  In about 20 seconds, the USB device will
  obtain the user name and password hash used to log into the
  computer. Fuller, who is better known by his hacker handle mubix, said the
  technique works using both the Hak5 Turtle ($50) and USB Armory ($155),
  both of which are USB-mounted computers that run Linux.

almost 800,000 accounts, probably originally hacked back in 2012, fell into
his hands.

The stolen database is just one of the many Keen has on file, in fact, and
each one can involve thousands or even millions of Internet accounts.
Vigilante.pw continually archives past data breaches as a way to warn the
public.  "I figured it would be a good way to raise awareness about

  Natural language models need annotations that teach the models the
  sentiment of a tweet, for example, or that a string of words is a question
  about the status of an online purchase.  Before a computer can know or
  "see" these things itself, it must be shown many confident positive and
  negative examples (aka ground truth or gold standard data). And you can
  only get that certainty from the right human annotators.  So what happens
  when you don't consider carefully who is annotating the data? What happens
  when you don't account for the differing preferences, tendencies and
  biases among varying humans? We ran a fun experiment to find out.

Subject: Re: Parking garage makes it easier for stalkers (RISKS-29.73)

It's not necessary to tie into the DMV computers to restrict tracking to the
authorized person. From my experience, paid parking garages issue a ticket
at time of entry that you hand in at exit, so the collector can verify how
long you have been parked (and therefore the appropriate payment). If a
serial number (run through a hashing routine to avoid the stalker guessing
the serial number based on another ticket issued close to the time of the
target's arrival) were printed on the ticket (camera can match plate to the
ticket issued), require the person requesting tracking to enter both the
license plate and the number from the ticket. The person who parked the car
but can't remember exactly where in the garage they did so will have the
ticket in their pocket/wallet/etc., and will therefore have access to the
number printed on it. A stalker won't have the ticket, so it would be pure
guesswork trying to find the number (tracking application should detect and
slow down response in cases of multiple incorrect entries - and when a
correct number is given, tell the user not only where their car is, but that
there have been X attempts to guess the "password").
