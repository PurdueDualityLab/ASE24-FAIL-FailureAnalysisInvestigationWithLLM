Subject: A Tesla driver was caught sleeping on Autopilot at
  high speed, police are charging him criminally

A Tesla driver was caught sleeping on Autopilot with their seat *fully
reclined* at high speed, according to police who criminally charged the
driver.

Alberta RCMP (Canada federal police) reported on a strange incident
involving a Tesla vehicle on Autopilot.

``Alberta RCMP received a complaint of a car speeding on Highway 2 near
Ponoka. The car appeared to be self-driving, traveling over 140 km/h [87
mph] with both front seats completely reclined and occupants appeared to be
asleep.''

With this report, they shared the picture of a Tesla Model S vehicle on
Twitter:

Tesla Autopilot is not a ``self-driving'' system but a suite of driver
assist features.

While it can technically drive autonomously on highways without driver
interventions, Tesla asks drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and to
pay attention at all times.

The automaker also implemented a system that requires drivers to frequently
apply light torque to the steering wheel in order for Autopilot to stay
active.

Some Tesla drivers have been getting around the system by *attaching a
weight to the steering wheel*

Subject: Weakened Encryption: The Threat to America's National Security
  (ThirdWay)

*Takeaways* For years, law enforcement officials have warned that, because
of encryption, criminals can hide their communications and acts, causing law
enforcement to struggle to decrypt data during their investigation -- a
challenge commonly referred to as ``going dark.'' They called on technology
companies to build a process, like a ``master key,'' to enable law
enforcement to unlock encrypted communications. While this may seem like a
tempting idea, it would have grave implications for our national security.
As more and more of our communications move online, users seek out encrypted
services to protect their privacy. Unlike telephonic communications, and
despite repeated requests by law enforcement to do so, Congress has not
required Internet communications platforms to give law enforcement access to
intercept user communications or access stored communications. In this
paper, we assess the national security risks to a requirement to provide
that master key (referred to throughout as ``exceptional'' or ``backdoor''
access) to encrypted communications and propose alternative approaches to
address online harms.

In short, requiring exceptional access to encrypted technologies would
undermine national security by:

   1. Weakening protections for the information that the national security
      community relies upon, especially as it flows over foreign networks.
      2. Creating a vulnerability in encrypted communications that could be
      accessed by foreign adversaries.
      3. Encouraging other countries to require tech and Internet companies
      to provide equivalent access to communications within their boundaries.
      4. This does not mean that the Internet should be a lawless zone. Law
      enforcement and the private sector can and should cooperate in addressing
      crimes on the Internet and can do so without undermining a protection as
      fundamental as encryption.  [...]

Subject: Mobile phone radiation may be killing insects: German study
  (phys.org)

https://phys.org/news/2020-09-mobile-insects-german.html

"Mobile phone and Wi-Fi radiation in particular opens the calcium channels
in certain cells, meaning they absorb more calcium ions.

"This can trigger a biochemical chain reaction in insects, the study said,
disrupting circadian rhythms and the immune system."

"Peter Hensinger of the German consumer protection organisation Diagnose
Funk said closer attention must be paid to the possible negative effects of
radiation on both animals and humans, particularly with regard to the
introduction of 5G technology."

The insect apocalypse threatens to disrupt food chains and our ecosystem. Do
WiFi and cellular device and tower radiation exposure also contribute to
premature insect mortality?

Photon energy is determined by E = h*f
   (h == Planck's constant, f == frequency).

Ultraviolet-C photons, known to cause melanoma, range in energy between
~4.5-12.4 eV (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet). 4.5 eV ~= 1100
THz; 12.4 eV ~= 3000 THz. A microwave oven operates @ ~2.5 GHz (~0.01
milli-electron volts).

5G technology (at a maximum) operates at ~30GHz (0.03 THz) or ~0.12
milli-electron volts which is insufficient, via the photoelectric effect, to
ionize an atom in a DNA's amino acid during reproduction and elevate genetic
mutation probability.

A certain species of bacteria has evolved a mechanism to survive ionizing
radiation exposure. See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans. Doubtful that insects
inherited this capability. Humans do not possess these genes.

Note that room temperature of 300 degrees Kelvin (25 degrees Celsius or ~77
degrees F) ~= 0.026 eV which is ~200X greater than the energy of a 30 GHz
radio-wave photon. Ambient thermal energy, inside or out, swamps cell phone
radiation. DNA evolved to accommodate heat exposure.

Do RF sources influence insect cell membrane ion mobility and initiate
premature death? https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22271-3
(MAR2018) documents effects of RF exposure on several insect species using
2-120 GHz radio-waves. Their conclusion: "This could lead to changes in
insect behavior, physiology, and morphology over time due to an increase in
body temperatures, from dielectric heating." 'Could' is the operative word.

What happens when Drosophila Melanogaster are exposed to 30 GHz radio-wave
radiation for 1 hour each day? Fruit flies experience slight warming for 1
hour. Atmospheric garden heat exposes a fruit fly to 200 times the photon
energy emitted by cellular radio-wave photons.

To my knowledge, there are no established (meaning non-conflicted,
independent peer-review) links to non-ionizing radiation and vitality, be it
insect or human. Ambient RF radiation contribution to mortality, human or
insect, is impossible given physics.

Where are the epidemiological clusters and studies of human glioblastomas
(brain cancer) or other malignancies from earlier generations of cellphone
use and persistent exposure to ambient RF from cellphone towers or radio and
TV broadcasts? They do not exist.

Habitat loss and pesticide exposure are known, obvious insect mortality
contributors. Atmospheric influences (such as extra CO2, CH4, SO2, or
pollution or aerosols ) on insect populations are likely contributors (see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_in_insect_populations#Causes_and_consequences).

Subject: Listening To An IPhone With AM Radio

Electronic devices can be surprisingly leaky, often spraying out information
for anyone close by to receive. [Docter Cube] has found another such leak,
this time with the speakers in iPhones. While repairing an old AM radio and
listening to a podcast on his iPhone, he discovered that the radio was
receiving audio the from his iPhone when tuned to 950-970kHz.

[Docter Cube] states that he was able to receive the audio signal up to 20
feet away. A number of people responded to the tweet with video and test
results from different phones. It appears that iPhones 7 to 10 are affected,
and there is at least one report for a Motorola Android phone.  The
amplifier circuit of the speaker appears to be the most likely culprit, with
some reports saying that the volume setting had a big impact. With the short
range the security risk should be minor, although we would be interested to
see the results of testing with higher gain antennas. It is also likely that
the emission levels still fall within FCC Part 15 limits.  [...]

Subject: A Quick Note on Voting Twice

> But if each ballot voted has to be checked to make sure it is not
> a second ballot, then the disruption factor is ENORMOUS.

Actually, not every ballot needs to be checked. Here's how it works:

If you vote by mail, when the envelope is received and your signature
validated, it's recorded that you voted. If you send in another vote by mail
ballot, when they try to validate your signature, the system will report you
have already voted. This is automatic and done when your signature is
checked.

So let's say you go to vote in person.

If you are doing a same-day registration, you vote conditionally. The
conditional ballot is handled the same as a provisional ballot.

If you have your vote by mail ballot and surrender it to the election
workers, they then print you a new ballot, and you vote in person.

If you do not have your vote by mail ballot, you then vote provisionally.

In all cases, if you have already signed the poll book, you vote
provisionally.

So the time-consuming checking is in processing the provisional and
conditional ballots. That can take quite a while; according to the election
officials in my county (Yolo), it can take 2-3 weeks to process them. It
took a bit longer at the last election due to COVID-19, but the Secretary of
State extended the dates.

Hope this clarifies things.

  [Of course, some precincts don't use electronic poll books, and are
  manual.  Mine has a paper list that one has to sign that cannot indicate
  whether you have already voted absentee.  When the absentee ballots are
  tallied later, the paper record would have to checked.  PGN]

Subject: The future is cyborg: Kaspersky study finds support for human
  augmentation (Reuters)

Nearly two thirds of people in leading Western European countries would
consider augmenting the human body with technology to improve their lives,
mostly to improve health, according to research commissioned by Kaspersky.

As humanity journeys further into a technological revolution that its
leaders say will change every aspect of our lives, opportunities abound to
transform the ways our bodies operate from guarding against cancer to
turbo-charging the brain.

The Opinium Research survey of 14,500 people in 16 countries including
Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Spain showed that 63% of people would
consider augmenting their bodies to improve them, though the results varied
across Europe.

In Britain, France and Switzerland, support for augmentation was low - at
just 25%, 32% and 36% respectively - while in Portugal and Spain it was
much higher - at 60% in both.

``Human augmentation is one of the most significant technology trends
today,'' said Marco Preuss, European director of global research and
analysis at Kaspersky, a Moscow-based cybersecurity firm.

``Augmentation enthusiasts are already testing the limits of what's
possible, but we need commonly agreed standards to ensure augmentation
reaches its full potential while minimising the risks,'' Preuss
said.  [...]

Subject: Police Across Canada Are Using Predictive Policing Algorithms,
  Report Finds (Nathan Munn)

Nathan Munn, *Vice*, 1 Sep 2020 (via David Farber)

Police across Canada are increasingly adopting algorithmic technology to
predict crime. The authors of a new report say human rights are threatened
by the practice.

<https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7q55x/police-across-canada-are-using-predictive-policing-algorithms-report-finds>

Police across Canada are increasingly using controversial algorithms to
predict where crimes could occur, who might go missing, and to help them
determine where they should patrol, despite fundamental human rights
concerns, a new report has found.

To Surveil and Predict: A Human Rights Analysis of Algorithmic Policing in
Canada is the result of a joint investigation by the University of Toronto's
International Human Rights Program (IHRP) and Citizen Lab. It details how,
in the words of the report's authors, ``law enforcement agencies across
Canada have started to use, procure, develop, or test a variety of
algorithmic policing methods,'' with potentially dire consequences for civil
liberties, privacy and other Charter rights, the authors warn.

The report breaks down how police are using or considering the use of
algorithms for several purposes including predictive policing, which uses
historical police data to predict where crime will occur in the
future. Right now in Canada, police are using algorithms to analyze data
about individuals to predict who might go missing, with the goal of one day
using the technology in other areas of the criminal justice system. Some
police services are using algorithms to automate the mass collection and
analysis of public data, including social media posts, and to apply facial
recognition to existing mugshot databases for investigative purposes.

``Algorithmic policing technologies are present or under consideration
throughout Canada in the forms of both predictive policing and algorithmic
surveillance tools.''

Police in Vancouver, for example, use a machine-learning tool called GeoDASH
to predict where break-and-enter crimes might occur. Calgary Police Service
(CPS) uses Palantir's Gotham software to identify and visualize links
between people who interact with the police -- including victims and
witnesses -- and places, police reports, and the properties and vehicles
they own. (A draft Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) conducted by CPS in 2014
and mentioned in the report noted that Gotham could ``present false
associations between innocent individuals and criminal organizations and
suspects'' and recommended measures to mitigate the risk of this happening,
but not all the recommendations have been implemented.)

The Toronto Police Service does not currently use algorithms in policing,
but police there have been collaborating with a data analytics firm since
2016 in an effort to ``develop algorithmic models that identify high crime
areas,'' the report notes.

The Saskatchewan Police Predictive Analytics Lab (SPPAL), founded in 2015,
is using data provided by the Saskatoon Police Service to develop algorithms
to predict which young people might go missing in the province. The SPPAL
project is an extension of the ``Hub model'' of policing, in which social
services agencies and police share information about people believed to be
``at risk'' of criminal behavior or victimization. The SPPAL hopes to use
algorithms to address ``repeat and violent offenders, domestic violence, the
opioid crisis, and individuals with mental illness who have come into
conflict with the criminal justice system,'' the report reads.

``We've learned that people in Canada are now facing surveillance in many
aspects of their personal lives, in ways that we never would have associated
with traditional policing practices,'' said Kate Robertson, a criminal
defense lawyer and one of the authors of the report, in a phone call with
Motherboard.

``Individuals now face the prospect that when they're walking or driving
down the street, posting to social media, or chatting online, police
surveillance in the form of systematic data monitoring and collection may be
at work,'' Robertson added.

The authors note that ``historically disadvantaged communities'' are at
particular risk of being targeted for surveillance and analysis by the
technology due to systemic bias found in historical police data.

Subject: Re: 44 Square Feet: A School-Reopening Detective Story (RISKS-32.26)

Take 2m physical distance guide, square for area/person, which seems

$ units \(2m\)^2 ft^2
43.055642 ft^2

One Canadian indoor store selling outdoor goods seems to have gone an order
higher:

$ units 20m^2 yd^2
23.919801 yd^2

Take care. Thanks, Brian Inglis, Calgary, Alberta, Canada
