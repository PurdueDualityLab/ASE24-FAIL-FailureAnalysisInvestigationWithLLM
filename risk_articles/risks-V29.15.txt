Subject: Reboot not a solution -- especially for commercial aviation

Terrestrial-bound computer users blindly accept a system reboot as a problem
solution.  In my experience this remains a constant in Windows (version 7
and below... I have no experience with 8 or above, thanks), and various
Apple OS's.  (My Linux boxes just keep on running).  This mindset has crept
into the maintenance practices of the commercial airlines.  For many years I
have read frequently the exploits of in-flight failures resolved by cycling
a circuit breaker; of a "maintenance engineer" doing much the same on the
ground to fix a "glitch".

I think a read of the NTSC's report on the crash of an Indonesia Air Asia
Airbus A320-200 which killed all aboard on 27 December, 2014, is worthy for
its potential to sober flight crews, maintenance and regulators:

     avherald.com/h?articleGf6abc7/0028&opt=0

That CRM, basic recovery procedures, and a host of other
allegedly-well-trained responses went out the window, including the
continued lack of side stick conflict detection in Airbus designs, can, I
think, be implicated in this mess... but it all began with a hard failure
and a "reboot", taking us back to the old principle of the straw that breaks
the camel's back.

In flight, system restarts must remain the option of the crews.  The very
hint of restricting flight crew access to the hardware meets with a strong
objection.  However, we also see in this instance that the act of shutting
off a system completely was not met with an appropriate crew response.
Reversion to lower levels of flight dynamic protections simply return the
airplane to stick and rudder. One may rightly ask why this is so
problematic.  In the thinner upper levels, with tighter speed/stall margins,
are crews simply not familiar enough to manage these extremes?

Among the lessons: things that go bump in the night tend to leave bits
floating on the ocean.  Need a reboot?  There's a good reason why.  Let's
abandon the cheap and easy way out as it only puts off the inevitable
disaster.

Subject: Working on Cheaper Sensors, Deeper Learnings

Automotive Intelligence - Consumer Technology Association

It is crucial for an autonomous car to be able to understand and learn
behaviors, weigh factors and make judgment calls, not simply to follow
rules, asserts Jim Buczkowski, global director of electronic systems,
research and innovation at Ford Motor Co. in Dearborn, MI. "I don't think
you can program for every single individual situation but you can't have a
situation where the machine comes back and says, 'I don't know what to do,'"
he says. Further, autonomous vehicles must be engineered for "graceful
failure" when technology can't function -- for example, when one of the
vehicle's sensors is blocked by dirt or inclement weather -- meaning "you
still have some capability for driver assistance, but you don't have full
autonomy," he explains. "Those are things that are part of the strategy that
folks are looking at and working on."

CIO via NNSquad
http://www.cio.com/article/3011576/ehr/why-electronic-health-records-arent-more-usable.html

  EHRs are designed to support billing more than patient care, experts say
  ... It shouldn't come as a surprise that most doctors are unhappy with
  their electronic health record (EHR) systems, which tend to be clunky,
  hard to use and may actually get in the way of truly excellent patient
  care ... Doctors' biggest complaint about the EHR is that it slows them
  down, especially in the documentation phase. "Compared to handwriting or
  dictating, EHRs take doctors nine times longer to enter the data,"
  Anderson says. "Sure, you have more information in the EHR than in paper
  records, but it takes more time." ... Other alerts go off to prevent
  adverse drug interactions with other medications, allergies, or foods.
  Many of these are inapplicable to particular patients, and after a while,
  doctors may stop paying attention to them or turn them off. Three quarters
  of EHRs don't allow the customization of these alerts, according to
  Anderson.

A (long) story of exposed passwords and lax security.

"The sales guy started renewing my Vodafone subscription and therefor needed
to log in at a dealer portal from Vodafone. He didn't remember the login
password, and, here it comes, on the screen he opened an Excel file which
contained *all* their passwords.

Is this happening for real? I had just told him minutes ago I'm an

Curiously and intensively I looked on the screen to get a picture of the
treasure trove that was in front of me. Passwords to view and modify
customer data of KPN, Vodafone, Telfort, T-Mobile, UPC, Tele2 and other
companies were right in front of me.

ABC 7, Chicago, 4 Dec 2015, Port St. Lucie, FL

A hit-and-run mystery was solved and a woman arrested in Florida after an
unusual call to 911.  It wasn't the driver who picked up the phone, but
instead it was the car itself that called for help.

Port St. Lucie police say a car safety feature helped them to track down
57-year-old Cathy Bernstein, who they say hit a truck and then [p]lowed
through a van on Prima Vista Boulevard.

Bernstein allegedly fled the scene, but her car's emergency assistance
feature didn't just make a record of the crash, it automatically contacted
911.

  The employee fired after being blamed for a massive data breach at the

  scapegoat by the agency.  In an exclusive interview with The Atlanta
  Journal-Constitution, longtime state programmer Gary Cooley said he did
  not have the security access to add millions of Social Security numbers
  and birth dates to a public data file -- something Secretary of State
  Brian Kemp accused him of doing.  And while he acknowledged a role in the

Kashmir Hill, Fusion, 30 Nov 2015
http://fusion.net/story/238742/tor-carnegie-mellon-attack/

Law enforcement has been complaining for years about the Web "going dark,"
saying that encryption and privacy tools are frustrating their ability to
track criminals online.  But massive FBI operations over the last year that
have busted 'hidden sites' used for the sale of drugs, hacking tools, and
child pornography suggest the digital criminal world has gotten lighter,
with law enforcement bragging that criminals can't "hide in the shadows of
the Dark Web anymore."  While mysterious about its tactics, law enforcement
indicated that it had found a way to circumvent the tool on which these
sites relied, a software called Tor.  But criminals are not the only ones
who rely on it.

to a concert and got backstage by on the spur of the moment editing the
band's Wikipedia web page to include his name as a step-brother to one of
the band members. He showed it to the guard at the door to the backstage
area ("See? Here's my ID, here's what it says on the Wikipedia web page
about the band - I'm his step-brother!"). Luckily, the guy and the band got
along well when he met them in the green room, and they deemed him "a

  who use computers moderately show modest gains over those who rarely do,
  heavy technology use has a negative impact.  "Students who use computers

Subject: "Why Node.js waited for OpenSSL security update before patching"
  (Fahmida Y. Rashid)

Fahmida Y. Rashid, InfoWorld Tech Watch, 4 Dec 2015
Node.js Foundation fixed two critical vulnerabilities in its open
source server-side JavaScript platform and addressed the newly patched OpenSSL
http://www.infoworld.com/article/3012157/security/why-nodejs-waited-for-openssl-security-update-before-patching.html

selected text:

The fact that Node.js Foundation chose to delay its patches to incorporate
OpenSSL fixes highlights the reality of open source code.  There are so many
dependencies between various projects that maintainers have to track bugs in
related libraries along with vulnerabilities in their own code. Modern
software development typically consists of only 10 percent original code and
90 percent from third-party libraries, said Christopher Frohoff, a security
researcher with SourceClear. It's the developer's responsibility to make
sure the applications don't link to vulnerable libraries.

Even though Node.js 0.10.x (Maintenance) was not impacted by the
above-mentioned vulnerabilities, users should still upgrade to the new
Maintenance version because it depends on OpenSSL v.1.0.1.

Many developers don't even know all the components being used in their
applications, making it difficult to tell when a vulnerability in a project
actually impacts their code. They may be aware of the libraries they're
calling, but not what additional libraries those libraries are including,
and the nesting can be several layers deep.  And some of those buried
libraries may never show up in the program's dependency tree.

=== End of Quotes ==
  Now that I have covered that risk, let me add another one.  I recently
  installed some software whose licencing agreement stated that I was
  responsible for any violations with libraries used by the product.  If the
  programmers of a package have difficulty keeping track of the
  dependencies, imagine how much tougher end users have it.  (Please do not
  bother stating that such terms would not hold up in court, because 1) they
  just might, and 2) even being threatened with court action can get
  expensive.)  [GW]

Having watched "A LEGO Brickumentary" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3214286/

have prototyped an automatic Lego garage parking tiny Lego cars before going

It sounds like some of these robogarages were built by the people who've
created car-crushing machines. Combining those functions would be efficient
-- push one button, park the car. Push the other, crush it into a cube.

Software and hardware mishaps, including some that have smashed or trapped
cars, have occurred at robotic garages around the country, but dozens of
them are proposed or underway.

  In some cases, Internet companies have been criticized for not taking down
  websites that belong to the Islamic State, only to have it discovered
  later that the sites were critical of it. Matthew Prince, chief executive
  of CloudFlare, a San Francisco company, said that in one case Internet
  activists criticized his company for keeping several Islamic State
  websites online when, in fact, the sites in question were
  pro-Kurdish. "It's particularly risky to take a bunch of tech companies
  that are not certified policy experts and insert them into Middle East
  politics," Mr. Prince said. Pulling all terror-related content is not
  always preferred by law enforcement. In several cases, tech executives
  say, they have been asked to keep terror-related content online so that
  law enforcement agents can monitor terrorist networks or because the
  content was created by law enforcement agents to lure terrorists into
  divulging information. The issue is thornier for companies like Facebook,
  in which the bulk of posts are meant to be private. "Do you want Facebook
  looking at over 1.5 billion people's posts?" said Zeynep Tufekci, an
  assistant professor in technology policy at the University of North
  Carolina at Chapel Hill. "And if so, then for what?"

I am not a physicist (or a pilot), but from photos I have seen it seems
clear the jet is relatively intact immediately after the missile hit. It
doesn't seem implausible that the control surfaces are working well enough
that it could indeed make a sharp turn at that point while the pilot decides
if ejection is necessary (or, indeed, jumps out of his skin while holding
the joystick).  So is everyone lying? I'm not sure we can infer it from an
analysis based on the premise that as soon as the missile hits the aircraft
becomes entirely inert.

Abstract: In the past several election cycles, presidential campaigns and
other well-funded races for major political offices have become data-driven
operations.  Presidential campaign organizations and the two main parties
(and their data consultants) assemble and maintain extraordinarily detailed
political dossiers on every American voter.  These databases contain
hundreds of millions of individual records, each of which has hundreds to
thousands of data points.  Because this data is computerized, candidates
benefit from cheap and nearly unlimited storage, very fast processing, and
the ability to engage in data mining of interesting voter patterns. [...]
