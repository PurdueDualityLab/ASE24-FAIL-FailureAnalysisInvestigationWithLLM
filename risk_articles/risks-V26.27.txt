Airlines unable to handle calls after snowstorm, *The Boston Globe*,
29 Dec 2010  [typo fixed in archive]

As airlines were scrambling to get flight schedules back to normal
yesterday, stranded travelers were struggling to reach them, sometimes being
left on hold for more than an hour - or worse, disconnected from the call.

Cali Archon of Portsmouth, N.H., tried calling JetBlue Airways for four
hours yesterday morning to rebook her 15-year-old daughter's flight to Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. But each time, after about five minutes of recorded
messages, the system told her: "Please try back at a later time. We are
doing the best we can to manage our call volumes at this time. This call
will end now.''

And then it did. ...

http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/top_stories/x1295283307/New-drug-law-will-track-more-prescriptions

Massachusetts residents face a new routine when they pick up certain
prescription drugs at the pharmacy on 1 Jan 2011.  Under a law passed last
summer, they will have to show a driver's license or another approved ID
before the druggist can give them prescriptions ranging from addictive
opiates to certain medicines for diarrhea. Their purchases will be recorded
in a massive database that will include their names, addresses and the kinds
and amount of pills they take.

The goal of the law is to combat the growing problem of prescription drug
abuse, particularly among teens and young adults. According to one federal
survey, Massachusetts ranked 8th among those 18-to-25 who have used drugs
not prescribed to them.

Mass State Rep. Harriet Stanley: ``This bill is a great example of how costs
increase without you realizing. We thought we had a grip, but we have to

typically used to prosecute crimes such as identity theft or stealing trade

Subject: Banks' Reaction to Broken-Chip-and-PIN is Broken

The UK Card Association, which represents organisations who offer
financial-card transactions in the UK, has written to the University of
Cambridge, http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/20101221110342233.pdf ,
asking it not to publish on the WWW some work by Omar Choudary on breaking
the Chip-and-PIN protocol used on most bank cards debit cards, and credit
cards. Reported in The Independent newspaper:
http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/banks-attempt-to-suppress-maths-students-expos233-of-chip-and-pin-2170396.html
and on Ross Anderson's Security Group blog
http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/ . Choudary's short blog post describing
his work is at
http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2010/10/19/the-smart-card-detective-a-hand-held-emv-interceptor/

The public knowledge that Chip-and-PIN is broken is almost a year old. It
was reported in German trade publications at the beginning of February 2010,
for example
http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/PIN-Pruefung-im-EMV-Verfahren-bei-EC-und-Kreditkarten-ausgehebelt-929528.html
(in German). The original work won a Best Paper award at the IEEE Symposium
on Security and Privacy in May 2010.

Apparently the banks have had about a year to fix a broken protocol and
haven't managed to promulgate one. So now their associations are writing to
people to ask them not to publish. That process has been known to be broken
for far longer than Chip-and-PIN.

On the other hand, maybe the banks shouldn't worry too much about word
getting around. I received in October a letter from American Express saying
that, with their new cards issued in January 2011, rather than just
signature on a transaction, they are introducing Chip-and-PIN "so you are
better protected from card abuse". Hadn't they heard?

Almost a year to the date after the landmark RockYou password hack, we have
seen another large password breach, this time of Gawker Media. While an
order of magnitude smaller, it's still probably the second largest public
compromise of a website's password file, and in many ways it's a more
interesting case than RockYou. The story quickly made it to the mainstream
press, but the reported details are vague and often wrong. I've obtained a
copy of the data (which remains generally available, though Gawker is
attempting to block listing of the torrent files) so I'll try to clarify the
details of the leak and Gawker's password implementation (gleaned mostly
from the readme file provided with the leaked data and from reverse
engineering MySQL dumps). I'll discuss the actual password dataset in a
future post.  ...

I think these folks misunderstand the concept of "security". The clout comes
from "three strikes and your locked out". Who cares what character the User
uses? And, limiting its length, specifying a character set, limiting the
character set, or creating other hurdles is down right dumb. Especially when
teamed up with an unlimited number of mistakes.  More and more people are
relying of "password memorize-ers" like Roboform, Keypass, or
LastPass. Seriously, when are folks going to realize how "Julius Caesar-ish"

Subject: When it comes to the cloud, fight it... or join it?

The US Veterans Administration has discovered that its employees in at least
9 hospitals were using commercial providers like Google and Yahoo to store
and share patient information in calendars and other documents, in violation
of VA policies.  The VA CIO says this shows that they need to make more
cloud services available to employees, lest the employees bypass official
systems in favor of commercial systems which do not have the same level of
protection.  (Let's ignore for a moment the assumption that VA systems *are*
any more secure.)

I'm ambivalent about this - on the one hand, just because the service is
available commercially doesn't mean that it should be provided to everyone
in an organization like a VA hospital.  On the other hand, it's pretty clear
that people will bypass security systems if they don't provide adequate
capabilities.  So the security organization is in a difficult position of
what to provide.

There seems a pretty clear parallel to multilevel secure systems -- if it's
too hard to move data from classified to unclassified systems, people will
figure out ways around it (cf Wikileaks).  But does that mean we should
allow easy interconnection and data movement?

Unfortunately, rejoicing (in this article as well as the previous one about
the inclusion of email within 4th Amendment protection) is premature.  IMHO
the WikiLeaks affair only shows that authorities had not caught up with the
Internet yet; but considering China as a case in point, the future looks
rather bleak.

Just as it is now impossible to drive a car legally on public roads anywhere
in the world without having registered both the vehicle and driver with the
authorities first, the situation in cyberspace is going to gravitate towards
the same level of control.  We all connect through a rather small number of
ISP's, all of whom depend on governments in many ways, and must obey local
laws and regulations.

Once legislators and regulators catch up, sites like WikiLeaks would suffer
the same fate as women driving in Saudi Arabia.  I'm afraid that this is
going to happen sooner than anyone dares to predict.

  has enormous impacts all around -- on the government security policies

Cryptographers Chosen to Duke It Out in Final Fight
New Scientist (12/13/10) Celeste Biever

The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has selected
five Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-3) entrants as finalists for its competition
to find a replacement for the gold-standard security algorithm.  The
finalists include BLAKE, devised by a team led by Jean-Philippe Aumasson of
the Swiss company Nagravision, and Skein, which is the work of computer
security expert and blogger Bruce Schneier.  "We picked five finalists that
seemed to have the best combination of confidence in the security of the
algorithm and their performance on a wide range of platforms" such as
desktop computers and servers, says NIST's William Burr.  "We wanted a set
of finalists that were different internally, so that a new attack would be
less likely to damage all of them, just as biological diversity makes it
less likely that a single disease can wipe out all the members of a
species."  The finalists incorporate new design ideas that have arisen in
recent years.  The Keccak algorithm from a team led by STMicroelectronics'
Guido Bertoni uses a novel idea called sponge hash construction to produce a
final string of 1s and 0s.  The teams have until Jan. 16, 2011, to tweak
their algorithms, then an international community of cryptanalysts will
spend a year looking for weaknesses.  NIST will pick a winner in 2012.

Hmmm...that didn't seem quite right.

24 hours later, the same Web page listed the tracking number twice,

  (Jon Borland)

[Source: Jon Borland, wired.com]

Speaking at the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Congress in Berlin on Tuesday, a
pair of researchers demonstrated a start-to-finish means of eavesdropping on
encrypted GSM cellphone calls and text messages, using only four sub-$15
telephones as network "sniffers," a laptop computer, and a variety of open
source software.

While such capabilities have long been available to law enforcement with the
resources to buy a powerful network-sniffing device for more than $50,000
(remember The Wire?), the pieced-together hack takes advantage of security
flaws and shortcuts in the GSM network operators' technology and operations
to put the power within the reach of almost any motivated tech-savvy
programmer. ...

It might work differently elsewhere, but here in the USA, the "standard"
is to sue everyone: the manufacturer, the airline, the FAA, the pilots,
all the way down to the mechanics that last touched the airplane.

Most engineering bodies have a code of ethics that includes something
similar to:

  Engineers, in the fulfillment of their professional duties, shall:
  Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.

These devices may not have been created by licensed professional engineers.
Most states in the USA allow design and manufacture of equipment without a
license, as long is it not something like a bridge, dam, or road.  (This is
called the "industrial exemption".)

Well, there are a couple of differences.

1. When an airliner crashes, it kills many people.  Big splashy headlines.
That's why the terrorists keep trying for airliners.  They could blow up a
bus, but a bus holds, what? 40 people?  Even a 737 holds 130 people.  A
mid-sized craft like the DC-8 holds over 250, and the 747 can seat over 500.
When there is "operator error" on a medical device, it kills one person.
All told, maybe a dozen people die before the normal checks built into our
hospital & clinic system(*) detect that something is wrong and take
countermeasures: replacing the device, special warnings, whatever it takes.

So a medical device failure just isn't as exciting as an airliner crashing.

2. Harm should be balanced against good.  Let's say you have a choice: you
can build a device and get it out the door in 6 months, or you can adopt
standards equivalent to those used for EAL-7 in the security community, and
get it out five years from now.  How many people will die of cancer or other
treatable diseases during those 4.5 years?  If you kill 5 people with
accidental overdoses, and save 20, aren't you ahead?

[Yeah, I know, but what if I'm one of the 5?  True, but I never know in
advance whether I'll be one of the 5, or one of the 20.  Overall, I'll take
those odds when I have an otherwise fatal -- or debilitating -- disease.]

AFAIK that already happens.  You can bet that every one of the patients
killed (or injured) by an accidental overdose has received compensation, or
soon will.  Does it really make a difference if the initial payer is a
hospital/clinic whose employee "misused" the device, or the manufacturer.
Either way, the insurance industry will sort out who pays how much.

One thing to consider: it is impossible to make something foolproof, because
fools are so ingenious.  I'm reminded of a news story I read a couple of
decades back:

  A nuclear sub came limping into port with inadequate power.  Technicians
  came on board to see what was wrong, and found that one of the engines was
  installed upside down (and hence, wasn't producing much power, if any).
  Now... the engineers who designed the engine knew that it would be
  installed by average Navy seamen -- which is to say, people with an IQ of
  around 100.  Not total dummies, but not especially smart either.  So they
  built it in the shape of a trapezoid: the top and bottom were of different
  widths.  And the space it was installed into was similarly shaped.

That didn't stop the installers.  When it wouldn't fit, they just used a
bigger hammer.

So yes, it would be nice if life-critical systems had better failure modes
and were less subject to operator error.  And in some cases, yes, the
manufacturer could and should have anticipated that and taken appropriate
steps to prevent it.

*But* nothing is ever perfect.  And the perfect is the enemy of the good.

   http://lists.csl.sri.com/mailman/listinfo/risks
 Alternatively, to subscribe or unsubscribe via e-mail to mailman
 your FROM: address, send a message to
   risks-request@csl.sri.com
 containing only the one-word text subscribe or unsubscribe.  You may
 also specify a different receiving address: subscribe address= ... .
 You may short-circuit that process by sending directly to either
   risks-subscribe@csl.sri.com or risks-unsubscribe@csl.sri.com
 depending on which action is to be taken.

 Subscription and unsubscription requests require that you reply to a
 confirmation message sent to the subscribing mail address.  Instructions
 are included in the confirmation message.  Each issue of RISKS that you
 receive contains information on how to post, unsubscribe, etc.
