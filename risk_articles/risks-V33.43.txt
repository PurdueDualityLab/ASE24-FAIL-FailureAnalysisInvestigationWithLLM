A technology enabling the transmission of fake locations to carry out murky

Subject: Amazon Solar Array Fires

The large flat rooftops on Amazon warehouses would seem to be ideal
locations for solar panel arrays. Indeed, Amazon has installed a significant
amount of PV capacity on their warehouses. However, poor design and/or poor
maintenance has resulted in a number of fires in these panel arrays.

While Amazon has not disclosed details of the PV systems involved in these
fires, we can hazard (!) a guess.

There are several major risks associated with solar panel arrays, mainly due
to the *direct current* (DC) coupling found in most older PV arrays.

DC-coupled PV panels are typically series-connected with voltages
up to 600V or more -- roughly the same voltage found in the "third
rail" of subway train systems, so *electrocution risk* is quite high.

DC-coupled PV panel strings run at 10 amps or more, providing a
rough equivalent to a low-grade *arc welding* system. This high
amperage, plus the high DC voltage, means that once an arc starts,
it may continue even after the conductor melts away and increases the
size of the arc gap.

Hail and other damage to PV arrays can thus later result in arcs and
fires.

Many of these risks can be reduced through the use of AC-coupled PV panels
which incorporate so-called 'microinverters' which convert DC to AC within
each individual PV panel.

Amazon took all U.S. solar rooftops offline last year after flurry of fires,
electrical explosions

"Between April 2020 and June 2021, solar panels atop Amazon fulfillment
centers caught fire or experienced electrical explosions at least six
different times."

"Some 220 solar panels and other equipment at the facility, known as FAT1,
were damaged by the three-alarm fire, which was caused by "an undetermined
electrical event within the solar system mounted on top of the roof," Leland
Wilding, Fresno's fire investigator, wrote in an incident report."

"The documents, which have never been made public, indicate that between
April 2020 and June 2021, Amazon experienced "critical fire or arc flash
events" in at least six of its 47 North American sites with solar
installations, affecting 12.7% of such facilities. Arc flashes are a kind of
electrical explosion."

Subject: U.S. Freight Rail Crisis Threatens More Supply-Chain Chaos (WiReD)

Federal regulators and the White House have been scrambling to prevent poor
service and a possible strike from jamming up a vital but often overlooked
network.

US freight railroads cut staff in recent years as part of a shift toward a
leaner and more profitable operating model dubbed Precision Scheduled
Railroading (PSR). It was invented by a Canadian railroad executive and
later replicated in the US, with the intention of simplifying a complex rail
network by running fewer, longer trains, replacing single-commodity trains
with mixed freight, and slashing labor. US freight trains grew 25 percent in
length between 2008 and 2017 and now sometimes reach 3 miles long. And while
the profits materialized, the promised service improvements have not always
followed.

The scammers used a fake email account to send phony billing requests to
Virginia Commonwealth University, authorities allege.

Prosecutors said Egbinola controlled an email account that sent phony
billing requests to Virginia Commonwealth University on behalf of Kjellstrom
and Lee, a construction company that had been doing contract work for the
university in Richmond.

The emails from "Rachel Moore" in fact came from an impostor account
mimicking the construction company's real domain name, according to
prosecutors. After communicating with Moore over several months, VCU
officials wired almost $470,000 in December 2018 to a bank account that
U.S. officials said was controlled by Egbinola's associates.

Subject: FBI Warns Individuals Employed in the Healthcare Industry of the
 Ongoing Scam Involving the Impersonation of Law Enforcement and Government
 Officials (FBI)

BALTIMORE -- he FBI is warning individuals employed in the healthcare
industry of ongoing widespread fraud schemes in which scammers impersonate
law enforcement or government officials in attempts to extort money or steal
personally identifiable information (PII).

Scammers, as part of a large criminal network, research background
information of their intended targets through a medical practice's website
and/or social media and supplement this information with information found
on common social media websites such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.,
to make themselves appear legitimate.

Scammers will often spoof authentic phone numbers and names and use fake
credentials of well-known government and law enforcement agencies to notify
the intended target they were subpoenaed to provide expert witness testimony
in a criminal or civil court case. The health care professional is notified
since they did not appear in court, they are in violation of the subpoena,
have been held in contempt, and an arrest warrant has been issued for them.

The targeted victim is told if they pay a court fine, they will no longer be
held in contempt. Scammers use an urgent and aggressive tone coupled with
scare tactics that claim the target victim is currently under surveillance
and an arrest warrant will involve an early morning police raid. The
intended victim is warned non-compliance will result in their medical
license being revoked.

Payment is demanded in various forms, with the most prevalent being prepaid
cards, wire transfers, and cash, sent by mail or inserted into
cryptocurrency ATMs. Victims are asked to read prepaid card numbers over the
phone or text a picture of the card. Mailed cash will be hidden or packaged
to avoid detection by normal mail scanning devices. Wire transfers are often
sent overseas and at times in person cash payments or drop offs are
completed.

If victims make money payments, a new reason to send additional funds is
used, such as additional court costs for having to continue the court
hearing. Often the scammers will change tactics and impersonate law
enforcement officers stating their victim has been identified as a
participant of a scam and are currently under investigation for their part
in sending money to the criminals. They are then told another payment will
exonerate them from their part of the scam.

Subject: Hand-counting elections riskier than computer counts? (CNN)

The US is seeing a growing liberal hostility to checking election results.
CNN and ACLU say that counting votes twice, by hand and by computer, is more
risky than counting just by computer. This may surprise many states which
use hand counts to check computer counts and many countries which just count
by hand. The Nevada ACLU director says the hand count "is going to give them
the opportunity to tamper with an election," as if computers are immune from
tampering. Election staff have always been partisan, and are constrained by
bipartisan procedures and public observation, which are easy to provide for
hand counts.

Election officials and security experts in the U.S. are concerned that
conspiracy theories related to the 2020 presidential election could
encourage interference with, or even attempts to sabotage, voting machines
during this fall's elections. Such concerns were highlighted on the last day
of voting in the Pueblo County, CO, June primary, when a poll worker found
an error message on a voting machine's screen. Election officials can take
measures to ensure unauthorized devices don't infect voting equipment, by
for example, configuring systems to recognize only proprietary devices. In
the Pueblo County case, the tamper-evident seal on the voting machine
appeared to be disturbed. The case remains under investigation.

Subject: Face Recognition Struggles to Recognize Us After Five Years

Matthew Sparkes, New Scientistm 24 Aug 2022,
via ACM TechNews, 29 Aug 2022

A test designed by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology's
Marcel Grimmer and colleagues found that facial recognition algorithms start
running into difficulty identifying people after they have aged five years.
The researchers used open-source alternatives to face recognition tools used
by police and smartphone manufacturers, as well as AI-generated images of
50,000 humans aged synthetically. Grimmer said the tools' accuracy declined
continuously from the point the reference image was captured. The algorithms
used to age faces synthetically from reference images also proved more
effective when the target was between 20 and 40 years, compared to children
and older adults. The implication is that new photos may be needed more
often to maintain accuracy and security.

Subject: Quantum AI Breakthrough: Theorem Shrinks Appetite for Training Data
 (LANL)

Los Alamos National Laboratory, 23 Aug 2022, via ACM TechNews, 29 Aug 2022

A proof devised by a multi-institutional team of scientists demonstrates
that quantum neural networks can train on minimal data. "The need for large
datasets could have been a roadblock to quantum AI, but our work removes
this roadblock," said Patrick Coles at the U.S. Department of Energy's Los
Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Coles said quantum AI training occurs in
a mathematical construct called a Hilbert space, and the theorem shows that
navigating this space requires only as many data points as the number of
parameters in a given model. The researchers could ensure that a quantum
model can be compiled in far fewer computational gates relative to the
volume of data. LANL's Marco Cerezo said, "We can compile certain very large
quantum operations within minutes with very few training points -- something
that was not previously possible."

https://orange.hosting.lsoft.com/trk/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-2f1c9x23590bx069928&

  [This makes no sense at all in the real world.  This proof seems to assume
  (among other things) that the model is absolutely correct with respect to
  even the most stringent unstated assumptions, and that the parameters are
  well defined.  Who is proving that those assumptions hold?  I suppose the
  next proof will be that Quantum Computing requires NO TRAINING WHATSOEVER
  irrespective of the quantumware and the software, under ill-defined or
  undefined assumptions.  PGN]

So, I understand that printing 3D guns is illegal in Canada and probably

It is not illegal, in general, to manufacture guns here. In fact, it iss a
profitable business for many companies. So if someone were to start a
business manufacturing guns using 3D printer technology, would that be a
legitimate business? If they were manufacturing, say, gardening tools using
