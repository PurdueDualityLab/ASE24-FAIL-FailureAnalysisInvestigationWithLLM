Subject: Bobby Tables and electoral fraud

The RISKS of online voting are well-known, and need not be covered again;
well, not for a while anyway.  However, there could be a new threat, should
SQL be involved in the counting process.  As usual, it involves
SQL-injection, or the "Bobby Tables attack" (named after the famous XKCD
comic).  Although doubtless meant as a joke, the following URL should make
hairs stand up upon one's neck:

http://alicebobandmallory.com/articles/2010/09/23/did-little-bobby-tables-migrate-to-sweden

(Basically it injects a "DROP TABLE" command.)

There seem to be many such examples; another one is if you want to clear
your driving record of speeding tickets:

http://hackaday.com/2014/04/04/sql-injection-fools-speed-traps-and-clears-your-record/

(That one drops the entire database.)

It's all a joke right now, of course, but how long will it be before it
becomes for real?

Subject: Using AI-Enhanced Malware, Researchers Disrupt Algorithms Used in
  Antimalware (Michael Kassner)

Michael Kassner, TechRepublic, 4 May 2017, via ACM TechNews, 5 May 2017

Researchers at Peking University in China have found machine learning-based
malware-detection algorithms cannot be used in real-world applications if
they are easily bypassed by some adversarial techniques.  The Chinese team
reached this conclusion based on previous Google research demonstrating a
technique to bypass malware-detection algorithms using altered information
that maximized malware classification errors; this made it impossible for
the detection algorithm to spot malware.  The Peking University researchers
built on the Google study by proposing the use of a generative neural
network, called MalGAN, and altering the original samples to make input and
output adversarial examples.  The team trained a MalGAN generator to create
adversarial examples that were capable of deceiving malware detectors.
"Experimental results show that the generated adversarial examples are able
to effectively bypass the malware detector," note Peking University
researchers Weiwei Hu and Ying Tan.

  Decisions (Matthew Hutson)

Matthew Hutson, *Science*, 2 May 2017, via ACM TechNews, 5 May 2017

A new study led by the Illinois Institute of Technology suggests artificial
intelligence can outperform legal scholars in the prediction of U.S. Supreme
Court rulings.  The researchers built a general prediction algorithm based
on the Supreme Court Database, drawing on 16 elements of each justice's
vote, supplemented with other variables.  For every year from 1816 to 2015,
the team built a machine-learning "random forest" statistical model that
reviewed all prior years and uncovered associations between case elements
and decision outcomes.  The model then examined the features of each case
for that year to anticipate rulings, and was fed data about the rulings so
it could update its approach and move on to the next year.  The algorithm
correctly forecast 70.2 percent of the high court's decisions and 71.9
percent of the justices' votes, while an earlier study found even
knowledgeable legal scholars are only about 66 percent right in comparison.

  [Whether this is this statistically significant may be less important than

  might start using this AI analysis to resolve difficult cases where they

Subject: Critical Level Firmware-level Security Vulnerability in Intel
  server chips

CVE-2017-5689, reports vulnerabilities in the implementation of remote
management features on Intel chips

Intel has reported a set of vulnerabilities in the remote management of its
business-grade processors (consumer-grade processors are reported not to be
affected). The vulnerabilities permit non-authorized access to Intel's
Active Management Technology, Intel Standard Manageability, or Intel Small
Business Technology.

The Intel chips contain a separate management processor with access to the
integrated Ethernet. Intel's advisory notes that AMT and ISM are exploitable
from the network; all three are vulnerable locally. The Register's article
notes that the remote management processor uses "network port 16992"
(unclear whether TCP or UDP; from context, probably TCP). Since this is a
feature of the management firmware, it is below all OS and VM-level
firewalls.

* From The Register:

  "In March 2017 a security researcher identified and reported to Intel a
  critical firmware vulnerability in business PCs and devices that utilize
  Intel Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel Standard Manageability
  (ISM), or Intel Small Business Technology (SBT)," an Intel spokesperson
  told The Register.

Intel is providing a signed firmware update by way of manufacturers.  The
Intel bulletin also includes interim mitigations.

Subject: The Lost Picture Show: Hollywood Archivists Can't Outpace
  Obsolescence (IEEE Spectrum)

Studios invested heavily in magnetic-tape storage for film archiving but now
struggle to keep up with the technology

Digital technology has also radically altered the way that movies are
preserved for posterity, but here the effect has been far less salutary.
These days, the major studios and film archives largely rely on a magnetic
tape storage technology known as LTO, or linear tape-open to preserve motion
pictures. When the format first emerged in the late 1990s, it seemed like a
great solution. The first generation of cartridges held an impressive 100
gigabytes of uncompressed data; the latest, LTO-7, can hold 6 terabytes
uncompressed and 15 TB compressed. Housed properly, the tapes can have a
shelf life of 30 to 50 years. While LTO is not as long-lived as polyester
film stock, which can last for a century or more in a cold, dry environment,
it's still pretty good.

The problem with LTO is obsolescence. Since the beginning, the technology
has been on a Moore's Law-like march that has resulted in a doubling in tape
storage densities every 18 to 24 months.  As each new generation of LTO
comes to market, an older generation of LTO becomes obsolete. LTO
manufacturers guarantee at most two generations of backward compatibility.
What that means for film archivists with perhaps tens of thousands of LTO
tapes on hand is that every few years they must invest millions of dollars
in the latest format of tapes and drives and then migrate all the data on
their older tapes -- or risk losing access to the information altogether.

We'll just call that a coincidence. Today that time period is referred to as

that is not the topic for today -- nor is the topic about the default on

bit of psychology is what is built in to new versions of software -- it is
both condescending and malevolent at the same time.

*How many apps are there in the out-of-box experience? *Well, we're talking
about the operating system of the device and every single application that
is installed on it.  And the list of applications is a default set --

– a charming multi-device app
<https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2017/02/google-hangouts-temporary-issues-with-firefox.html>,
right? But if you have a brand new Galaxy S8, the default for Hangouts is to
enable permissions to access the phone's Camera, Contacts, Location,
Microphone, Phone, SMS and Storage, each of which must individually have App
Permissions set to Off -- because the defaults are set to On
<http://www.androidcentral.com/run-permissions-why-change-android-60-may-make-you-repeat-yourself>.
So let's say this phone sells between 25 million or more

say that 42% of those buyers are 65+.

10 million seniors globally will buy this new phone. Examining the
permissions, setting the defaults to Off in individual apps

Subject: Senseless Government Rules Could Cripple the Robo-Car Revolution

Few technological advancements bring to mind the American spirit of
innovation like Henry Ford and his Model T. In the wake of his
transportation innovation, the horse and buggy became an anachronism as the
mass-produced automobile reshaped our cities, led to the emergence (for
better or worse) of the suburbs, and revolutionized how we move goods and
people.

Now, there's little doubt that autonomous vehicles are the next frontier of
transportation. These vehicles are projected to make our roads safer,
potentially reducing fatalities by orders of magnitude. Along the way,
however, there are a number of roadblocks to surmount: infrastructure
issues, restrictive state licensing policies, driver education,
cybersecurity and privacy vulnerabilities, and more. For innovators,
regulators, and policymakers, solving these problems will involve a long
to-do list, but a pointless regulatory scuffle over technology standards
should not be on it.

So why is the federal agency responsible for our road safety looking to
introduce a totally avoidable roadblock to automotive innovation by
mandating a severely flawed technological standard for vehicle
communications?

Here's the debate: Autonomous vehicles of the future will need to
communicate with each other and the infrastructure around them, signaling to
avoid collisions and informing other cars about traffic and road
conditions. Cars will need to sense pedestrians and wildlife, and generally
become better drivers than we are. There are two leading contenders for how
this communication will happen: Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC)
and next-generation wireless 5G networks.

Subject: Re: Autonomous vehicle... (Shapir, RISKS-30.25)

I would hope that an autonomous vehicle would act more like an intelligent
driver than a really stupid driver.

An autonomous vehicle should detect the fact that it is approaching a
junction, check the visibility of the other roads into the junction and
approach at a safe speed given the visibility and seen and potential unseen
traffic.

The autonomous vehicle should also detect the road markings that are usually
present along with a stop sign.

An autonomous vehicle that dangerously "blows through" a junction because it
did not detect the stop sign is dangerous in many other situations: a blind
junction without a stop sign, a junction with the road markings but no stop
sign, a junction where the stop sign has fallen down or been obscured by a
tree, and so on.

This is a fairly difficult problem.  For example, "apple" is in fact five

mixed-script names a long time ago, but it's going to be a challenge to
identify strings entirely written in one script that happen to look like

outlaw one or the other.

Perhaps the US Government could set up some kind of national registry where

Then, all you have to do is persuade the cops to check this number.

According to the "birthday problem" you only need 23 "John Smiths"

According to whitepages.com there are 1,791 John Smiths in New York.

  [Sarcasm does not overcome the problem.  We have had cases in RISKS where
  two people with the same birthdate and name actually had the same SSN,
  unbeknownst to each other.  There are cases where many people (e.g.,

  employer?).  And then there are people with multiple identities and
  multiple SSNs (for nefarious purposes?).  PGN]

It seems that the team that designed the DMV's system did not include a
Catholic or Anglican person.  Many churches keep a calendar of saints, where
each day of the year commemorates a certain saint; newborn babies are often
given the name of the saint on whose day they were born.

This custom greatly increases the odds that people born on the same date
would also have the same first name, especially if that name is rare.

Another time I lost my phone, and even though the new phone had the same

and the TOTP seeds in the Google Authenticator app.  Oops.  (For the latter,
when I reset the accounts I scanned the seeds both on my phone and on my

I've also had the battery die in keyfob code generators.  Oops.

2FA is a useful defense against some kinds of password stealing attacks, but
it definitely has its own failure modes.

It's the stuff corporate nightmares are made of.  The video of Dr. David Dao
being dragged off United Express Flight 3411 on April 9, 2017, his face
bloodied, quickly went viral. People (read: potential customers) questioned
why a passenger who was already seated and held a proper boarding pass would
be forcibly removed to make space for an airline employee.

Social media feeds were swamped with bitter commentary.  Ad parodies
included the taglines such as ``We beat our competitors -- not our
customers'' and ``The only things we pull out of the plane are your two free
checked bags.'' Jimmy Kimmel, Ellen DeGeneres and other entertainers had a
field day.  Down the road, the incident is likely to become a business
