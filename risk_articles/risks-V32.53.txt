Subject: Confusing computer-interface complexity causes train crash

In November 2019, the driver of an "Intercity Express" class 800 train was
heading into the maintenance depot at Neville Hill, near Leeds, England.
Another empty train was in front of him on the same track into the depot, so
he waited for it to start moving, then put on power at the lowest setting.

About 30 seconds later the two trains collided.  (There were no injuries,
but his train was derailed and both trains needed repairs.)

Although an experienced driver, the man was relatively unfamiliar with the
class 800, and didn't realize that even the lowest power setting would
accelerate this train so fast.  So he'd assumed it was safe to look down at
the computerized controls for a little while.

The reason he needed to do this was that, partly for political reasons, the
class 800 is equipped both with on-board diesel engines and with a
pantograph for overhead electric power.  So the pantograph should be raised,
and the diesels turned off, if and only if there *is* an overhead wire.
Rather than leave the control of this to fallible humans, it is implemented
by computer ("Automatic Power Changeover" or APCO).

Trackside beacons mark the key positions where things have to be done, and
the specific train service must be identified to the computer by the driver
typing its 4-character code into the control console touchscreen.

The train's previous code of 5D29 had expired when it got to Leeds, and the
driver should have changed it to 1D29 to go into the depot, but the system
would not accept it.  This was because, after typing the 4 characters, he
was supposed to touch a "Check Stops" button, which would cause the computer
to display a list of the stops for this train service, and then a "Home"
button to return the console to the home screen.  Well, the driver knew
there weren't any stops before getting to the depot, so he skipped Check
Stops and just touched "Home".  But what his training on the controls had
*not* mentioned was that this canceled the change of code.

Seeing that this hadn't worked, and not wanting the diesels to come on
unnecessarily, he used the controls to disable the APCO, and then when he
passed the last beacon before the depot, re-enabled it -- as he had been
trained to, so that the next driver wouldn't be confused.  And it was the
re-enabling step what distracted him from avoiding the crash.

Subject: Expectations of GPS accuracy contribute to train derailment

In January 2020 a freight train derailed on an overpass over a road in north
London, England.  There were no injuries, but the train was damaged as well
as a considerable length of track.

The track on the bridge was supported on wooden beams running lengthwise
under the rails (like on the old Great Western Railway) and connected by
steel cross-members.  This design is lighter than conventional track and
therefore allowed the bridge to be more lightly built, but the long-term
plan is to eliminate it from use.

In this case the configuration did not allow the wood to be easily
inspected, and it had deteriorated, but this was not known.  What could
readily be done, and was done regularly, was to check the position of the
rails by running a track-recording train over the line, and repair any
problems seen.

On several occasions in the preceding months, this train had reported a
problem in the area of this bridge: the rails were wide to gauge, i.e. too
far apart.  Crews were sent out to the location it reported, repaired some
faults they saw in the track, and then checked that the rails were within
the allowed tolerance of the correct gauge.

But the train had reported its position using GPS, and while this was
claimed to be accurate to 1 meter, it wasn't.  Crews were expected to use
handheld GPS devices to locate the same position within 3 meters, but the
work they did was a few meters west of the bridge, not where they might have
seen the actual problem.

This wasn't the only cause of the accident, but it is the one I'm mentioning
here.  Full report at:

Subject: Boeing calls for global grounding of 777s with Pratt&Whitney engines
  (NYTimes)

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/21/business/faa-boeing-777-engines.html

"Boeing said on Sunday that all 128 of its 777 jetliners powered by a
particular Pratt & Whitney engine model should be grounded worldwide until
the Federal Aviation Administration determines the best way to inspect the
engines."

Several hundred passengers experienced "the flight of their lives" in two
incidents, apparently due to engine blade fracture from metal fatigue.

Curiously, discloses the FAA met a few days before the UAL 328 incident on
20FEB2021 to discuss airline engine inspection frequency.
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/24/politics/faa-meeting-engine-inspections/index.html

The investigatory dust will eventually settle. A revised Pratt & Whitney jet
engine inspection protocol will become regulation standard operating
procedure.

The flying public relies on trained and qualified professionals to certify
an aircraft as safe-to-fly. Their ethics, competence, and professional
judgment are key to sustain aircraft maintenance life cycle, and the air
transportation industry reliability. Public safety depends on inspection to
determine essential aircraft maintenance actions.

Aircraft maintenance is an example of the "expert service problem." It is a
well-known subject in economics. See "When Trust in an Expert Is Unwise,"
via https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/07/business/07leonhardt.html
  "...the same expert who is diagnosing the flaw is the one who will be paid
  to fix it. In most of these cases, consumers aren’t sophisticated
  enough to make an independent judgment. That’s why they went to the
  expert."

Jet engine blade fracture from metal fatigue exemplifies the expert service
problem. Jet mechanics and engineers apply procedures and tools to diagnose
engine problems and recommend maintenance. They are paid to repair engines
to achieve safety compliance.

Consumers rely on jet engine maintenance experts to sustain safe-to-fly
readiness. Faulty, or compromised, expertise can intensify consumer air
transportation risks. These incidents are notable, and sometimes
spectacular.

Aircraft maintenance records are apparently analogous to personal medical
records: they constitute confidential information requiring protections
against disclosure. Devastating economic consequences would materialize if
aircraft maintenance records were stolen, manipulated or falsified, and
leaked.

Hypotheticals:

How many  passengers involved  in these two  incidents would have  chosen to
book a different flight if they knew the engine blades on their flights were
identified as vulnerable to fracture from metal fatigue? How many passengers
would be  deterred from booking the  flight given the chance  to examine the
engine inspection records at the point-of-sale?

Risk: Aircraft maintenance record disclosure.

Subject: New Browser Attack Allows Tracking Users Online With JavaScript
  Disabled (The Hacker News)

Researchers have discovered a new side-channel that they say can be
reliably exploited to leak information from web browsers that could then be
leveraged to track users even when JavaScript is completely disabled.

"This is a side-channel attack which doesn't require any JavaScript to run,"
the researchers said. "This means script blockers cannot stop it. The
attacks work even if you strip out all of the fun parts of the web browsing
experience. This makes it very difficult to prevent without modifying deep
parts of the operating system."

In avoiding JavaScript, the side-channel attacks are also architecturally
agnostic, resulting in microarchitectural website fingerprinting attacks
that work across hardware platforms, including Intel Core, AMD Ryzen,
Samsung Exynos 2100, and Apple M1 CPUs =E2=80=94 making it the first known
side-channel attack on the iPhone maker's new ARM-based chipsets.

The *findings* <https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04952>, which come from a group
of academics from the Ben-Gurion Univ. of the Negev, the University of
Michigan, and the University of Adelaide, will be presented at the USENIX
Security Symposium in August 2020.

Side-channel attacks typically rely on indirect data such as timing, sound,
power consumption, electromagnetic emissions, vibrations, and cache behavior
in an effort to infer secret data on a system. Specifically,
microarchitectural side-channels exploit the shared use of a processor's
components across code executing in different protection domains to leak
secret information like cryptographic keys.

Additionally, studies have also previously demonstrated fully automated
attacks such as Rowhammer <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.06955v1.pdf> that rely
on nothing but a website with malicious JavaScript to trigger faults on
remote hardware, thereby gaining unrestricted access to systems of website
visitors.  [...]

Subject: Calling All Ham Radio Operators

I'd have thought if they were smarter they'd have used a more obscure code,
but this was readily available and reasonably ubiquitous.

https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-phishing-attack-uses-morse-code-to-hide-malicious-urls/

Writer Lawrence Abrams describes the attack as follows:

  An email includes an HTML attachment named in such a way as to appear to
  be an Excel invoice for the company. These attachments are named in the
  format '[company_name]_invoice_[number]._xlsx.hTML.'  The attachment
  includes JavaScript that maps letters and numbers to Morse code. For
  example, the letter '*a*' is mapped to '*.-*' and the letter '*b*' is
  mapped to '*-...*', etc.

The script then calls a decodeMorse() function to decode a Morse code string
 into a hexadecimal string. This hexadecimal string is further decoded
into JavaScript tags that are injected into the HTML page.These injected
scripts combined with the HTML attachment contain the various resources
necessary to render a fake Excel spreadsheet that states their sign-in timed
out and prompts them  to enter their password again.

Once a user enters their password, the form will submit the password to a
remote site where the attackers can collect the login credentials.

This campaign is highly targeted, with the threat actor using the
logo.clearbit.comservice to insert logos for the recipient's companies into
the login form to make it more convincing. If a logo is not available, it
uses the generic Office 365 logo.

Subject: Microsoft's dream of decentralized IDs enters the real world (WiReD)

The company will launch a public preview of its identification platform this
spring -- and has already tested it at the UK's National Health Service.

For years, tech companies have touted blockchain technology as a means to
develop identity systems that are secure and decentralized. The goal is to
build a platform that could store information about official data without
holding the actual documents or details themselves. Instead of just storing
a scan of your birth certificate, for example, a decentralized ID platform
might store a validated token that confirms the information in it. Then when
you get carded at a bar or need proof of citizenship, you could share those
pre-verified credentials instead of the actual document or data. Microsoft
has been one of the leaders of this pack -- and is now detailing tangible
progress toward its vision of a decentralized digital ID.

  teaching us (guardknox.com)

https://blog.guardknox.com/what-the-worldwide-shortage-of-semiconductor-chips-is-really-teaching-us

"After the start of development, every change request requires a lengthy
process to approve, as suppliers are attempting to increase the impact of
the change (due to financial and risk considerations) and the OEMs are
trying to downplay the change (to reduce costs). This leads to a very
inflexible process. This is made worse by the fact that introducing
additional suppliers or specialized suppliers to solve a particular issue,
is almost impossible. This is true for software level changes, and even more
so for hardware level changes."

"The Resilient Enterprise: Overcoming Vulnerability for Competitive
Advantage," by Yossi Sheffi teaches that whipsawing multiple suppliers on
price and quantity procurement affords a reflexive means to sustain
manufacturing capacity.
(https://www.amazon.com/Resilient-Enterprise-Overcoming-Vulnerability-Competitive/dp/0262693496)

But if there's a supply shortage? One cannot whipsaw during a supply deficit
without procurement cost escalation (aka biding war).

The semiconductor manufacturing shortage reveals a global capacity gap
arising from pandemic-driven demand signals, similar to commodity shortages
(oil or rare earth metals) when demand out-paces supply.  Semiconductor
manufacturing is principally performed in Asia; the US and Europe dominate
semiconductor design, but find greater profit margins from license
royalties.

What drove the semiconductor manufacturing exodus from US and European
shores? Follow the money: "The Private Equity Party Might Be Ending.

Subject: Why a YouTube chat about chess got flagged for hate speech (WiReD)

AI programs that analyze language have difficulty gauging context. Words
such as *black*, *white*, *attack* can have different meanings.

Last June, Antonio Radic [with superscript c overstrikc '], the host of a
YouTube chess channel with more than a million subscribers, was
live-streaming an interview with the grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura when the
broadcast suddenly cut out.

Instead of a lively discussion about chess openings, famous games, and
iconic players, viewers were told Radic's video had been removed for
*harmful and dangerous* content*. Radic saw a message stating that the
video, which included nothing more scandalous than a discussion of the
King's Indian Defense, had violated YouTube's community guidelines. It
remained offline for 24 hours.

Exactly what happened still isn't clear. YouTube declined to comment beyond
saying that removing Radic's video was a mistake. But new study suggests it
reflects shortcomings in artificial intelligence programs designed to
automatically detect hate speech, abuse, and misinformation online.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56195288

"From autonomous harvesting robots and drones that can spray crops, to
artificial intelligence, and the use of 'big data', farmers around the world
are turning to high-tech solutions to address issues ranging from food
insecurity, to climate change, and pandemic-induced staff cuts.

"Collectively, this increased use of technology in agriculture is known as
'precision farming', and it is a booming industry. One report suggests that
its global value will reach $12.9bn (£9.1bn) by 2027, with average annual
growth of 13% between now and then."

US Department of Agriculture estimates 2019 agricultural and food sector
economy @ US$ 1.1T.

Subject: Spy agencies have big hopes for AI

  [Thanks to Ross Anderson]

*The Economist* has just run a piece that's bang on topic:

https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/03/02/spy-agencies-have-big-hopes-for-ai

Spy agencies have big hopes for AI; This isn't their first attempt
*The Economist*, 2  Mar 2021

When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), spy agencies have been at it
longer than most. In the cold war, America's National Securit Agency (NSA)
and Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) explored early
AI to help transcribe and translate the enormous volumes of Soviet
phone-intercepts they began hoovering up in the 1960s.

Yet the technology was immature. One former European intelligence officer
says his service did not use automatic transcription or translation in
Afghanistan in the 2000s, relying on native speakers instead. Now the spooks
are hoping to do better. The trends that have made AI attractive for
business -- more data, better algorithms, and more processing power to make
it all hum -- are giving spy agencies big ideas, too.

On February 24th GCHQ published a paper on how AI might change its work.
``Machine-assisted fact-checking'' could spot faked images, check
disinformation against trusted sources and identify social-media bots.  AI
might block cyber-attacks by ``analysing patterns of activity on networks
and devices'', and fight organised crime by spotting suspicious chains of
financial transactions.

This sort of thing is now commonplace. The Nuclear Threat Initiative, an
NGO, recently showed that applying machine learning to publicly available
trade data could spot previously unknown companies suspected of involvement
in the illicit nuclear trade. But spy agencies are not restricted to
publicly available data.

Some hope that, aided by their ability to snoop on private information, such
modest applications could pave the way to an AI-fueled juggernaut.  ``AI
will revolutionise the practice of intelligence, gushed a report published
on March 1st by America's National Security Commission on Artificial
Intelligence, a high-powered study group co-chaired by Eric Schmidt, a
former executive chairman of Alphabet, Google's parent company; and Bob
Work, a former deputy defence secretary.

The report does not lack ambition. It says that by 2030 America's 17 or so
spy agencies ought to have built a "federated architecture of continually
learning analytic engines" that crunches everything from human intelligence
to satellite imagery to foresee looming threats.  The commission points
approvingly to the Pentagon's response to covid-19, which integrated dozens
of data sets to identify covid hotspots and manage demand for supplies.

Yet what is possible in public health is not always so easy in national
security. Western intelligence agencies must contend with laws governing how
private data may be gathered and used. In its paper, GCHQ says that it will
be mindful of systemic bias, such as whether voice-recognition software is
more effective with some groups than others, and transparent about margins
of error and uncertainty in its algorithms. American spies say, more
vaguely, that they will respect `human dignity, rights, and These
differences may need to be ironed out. One suggestion made by a recent task
force of former American spooks in a report published by the Centre for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington was that the Five
Eyes intelligence alliance -- America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New
Zealand -- create a shared cloud server on which to store data.

In any case, the constraints facing AI in intelligence are as much practical
as ethical. Machine learning is good at spotting patterns -- such as
distinctive patterns of mobile-phone use -- but poor at predicting
individual behaviour. That is especially true when data are scarce, as in
counter-terrorism. Predictive-policing models can crunch data from thousands
of burglaries each year. Terrorism is much rarer.

That rarity creates another problem, familiar to medics pondering
mass-screening programs for rare diseases. Any predictive model will
generate false positives, in which innocent people are flagged for
investigation. Careful design can drive the false-positive rate down.  But
because the "base rate" is lower still -- there are, mercifully, very few
terrorists -- even a well-designed system risks sending large numbers of
spies off on wild-goose chases.

Even the data that do exist may not be suitable. Data from drone cameras,
reconnaissance satellite and intercepted phone calls, for instance, are not
currently formatted or labeled in ways that that are useful for machine
learning. Fixing that is a ``tedious, time-consuming, and still primarily
human task exacerbated by differing labeling standards across and even
within agencies'', notes the CSIS report. That may not be quite what
would-be spies signed up for.

https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/more-top-tier-companies-targeted-by-new-type-of-potentially-serious-attack/

Ars Technica article by Dan Goodin:

  The goal of these attacks is to execute unauthorized code inside a
  target's internal software build system.  The technique works by uploading
  malicious packages to public code repositories and giving them a name
  that's identical to a package stored in the target developer's internal
  repository.

Two attack mechanisms are mentioned in the article: putting evil code in a
module with the same name as a target developer's code but with an
apparently newer version, or putting the evil code in a post-install script
which is part of the fake package.

The people tricked by these attacks trusted external repositories and
package manager programs that turned out to be vulnerable.  Ken Thompson's
1984 "Reflections on Trusting Trust" is a clear description of the risk.
"The moral is obvious. You can't trust code that you did not totally create
yourself."  https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/358198.358210

Subject: Thousands of Android and iOS Apps Leak Data From the Cloud (WiReD)

It's the digital equivalent of leaving your windows or doors open when you
leave the house -- and in some cases, leaving them open all the time.

For years, simple setup errors have been a major source
<https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-s3-data-exposure/> of exposure
<https://www.wired.com/story/magecart-amazon-cloud-hacks/> when companies
keep data in the cloud. Instead of carefully restricting who can access the
information stored in their cloud infrastructure, organizations too often
misconfigure their defenses. It's the digital equivalent of leaving the
windows or doors open at your house before going on a long vacation. That
leaky data problem applies to more than just the web services that typically
grab headlines. Mobile security firm Zimperium has found that these
exposures pose a major problem for iOS and Android apps as well.

Zimperium ran automated analysis on more than 1.3 million Android and iOS
apps to detect common cloud misconfigurations that exposed data. The
researchers found almost 84,000 Android apps and nearly 47,000 iOS apps
using public cloud services -- like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, or
Microsoft Azure in their backend as opposed to running their own servers. Of
those, the researchers found misconfigurations in 14 percent of those totals
-- 11,877 Android apps and 6,608 iOS apps -- exposing users' personal
information, passwords, and even medical information.

  (Mother Jones)

Its interests probably transverse the U.S. government more than any other
company.

Everything about Amazon is big. It's the second-biggest retailer
in the world. Its founder, Jeff Bezos, possesses the biggest fortune in the
world. And the company has developed a big revolving door in Washington
through which government officials and employees whisk and land in
well-paying jobs at Amazon, which has a big list of interests it seeks to
protect and advance in the nation's capital.

A Mother Jones investigation has identified at least 247 US government
officials and employees -- with about 150 hailing from the intelligence,
cybersecurity, law enforcement, and military fields -- who were hired by
Amazon in the past 10 years or so. About 200 of them have been retained by
the fast-growing company since the start of 2017. This list is not
comprehensive and represents what is likely only a portion of federal
employees who left government service for Amazon. It was compiled by
searching LinkedIn and locating people who, according to their profiles, had
worked in the federal government directly before moving to Amazon; it relies
on information provided by the platform's users. There are no public records
that track all the US officials and employees hired by Amazon or other
firms.

Subject: Too much choice is hurting America (NY Times)

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/opinion/deregulation-health-care-electricity.html

"But the argument that more choice is always good rests on the assumption
that people have more or less unlimited capacity to do due diligence on
every aspect of their lives -- and the real world isn't like that. People
have children to raise, jobs to do, lives to live and limited ability to
process information."

Due diligence fulfillment is exhausting, and requires specific subject
matter expertise to competently pursue. A consumer cannot conceivably
comprehend all supply chain intricacies that either promote or suppress
product risks. Restricted product information disclosure conceal industrial
trade secrets or other intellectual property, information essential to aid
consumer safety or health determination. The law and regulation, when
enforced, usually deters irresponsible and harmful products from entering
the marketplace.

Public trust abuse accrues from product failures. These unfortunate, often
spectacular, events elevate awareness of product risks. Public trust erodes
when these incidents are traced to industry-influenced political decisions
and legislation directing regulators to cede approval
authority. Self-certification authority is a political choice that empowers
businesses to deprioritize public health and safety interests.

Krugman concludes, "So the next time some politician tries to sell a new
policy -- typically deregulation -- by claiming that it will increase
choice, be skeptical. Having more options isn't automatically good, and in
America we probably have more choices than we should."

Self-certification accelerates product approvals and marketplace
introduction, but diminishes consumer protections to a legal thread dangling
by "terms of service," a frail substitute for independent oversight and
skilled judgment of product safety -- the last line of consumer defense. The
self-certification juggernaut might sail on, but disaster trails its wake.

Risk: Deregulation.

Subject: The problems with anti-vaccers' precautionary principle arguments
  (The Logic of Science)

Invoking the precautionary principle is a favorite tactic of anti-vaccers,
anti-GMO activists, and various other groups that are prone to opposing
scientific advances, but there are numerous issues with this strategy. The
exact definition of the precautionary principle is a bit amorphous and
variable, but the general concept is that before taking an action that has
potential risks (particularly with the application of something new), the
burden of proof should be on the proponent to demonstrate the safety of that
action before taking it.  There is certainly an element of validity to
this. I absolutely agree, for example, that new medications should be tested
and shown to be safe before being made publicly available (indeed, that is
part of why we have organizations like the FDA that regulate the approval of
new drugs). Similarly, months ago when COVID vaccines were in early stages
of testing, I and many other ardent pro-vaccers stated that while the
vaccines were promising, we wanted to see the results of the tests before
drawing any conclusions. That is a completely rational, evidence-based way
to approach the situation. New drugs, vaccines, and technologies certainly
have the potential to cause harm. So, it is not unreasonable to want safety
testing prior to their use.

Where this becomes problematic, however, is in determining what constitutes
reasonable evidence. Groups like anti-vaccers have a tendency to stretch the
precautionary principle to unreasonable limits and use it as an excuse for
science-denial, rather than a legitimate decision-making tool. Usually, what
I see is an incorrect insistence that the precautionary principle demands
absolute assurance of safety and that it should be used in a strictly binary
decision tree where any possible risk means that the thing in question
should not be used, regardless of the known benefits. This is very bad risk
assessment and ignores important aspects of how science actually works. As
I'll explain, science is about probabilities, not absolutes, and you must
consider both the risk and benefit of an action.

highlights the need for strong public policy to enable people more likely to
deal with employment discrimination, like women and older workers, to obtain
basic IT skills. Pavlou said, "Workers are expected to obtain these IT

Subject: ES&S hashcode testing is wrong in 3 ways

We just published this article:
Andrew Appel and Susan Greenhalgh
Voting Machine Hashcode Testing: Unsurprisingly insecure, and surprisingly
  insecure
https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2021/03/05/voting-machine-hashcode-testing-unsurprisingly-insecure-and-surprisingly-insecure/

The accuracy of a voting machine is dependent on the software that runs it.
If that software is corrupted or hacked, it can misreport the votes. There
is a common assumption that we can check the legitimacy of the software that
is installed by checking a hash code and comparing it to the hash code of
the authorized software. In practice the scheme is supposed to work like
this: Software provided by the voting-machine vendor examines all the
installed software in the voting machine, to make sure it's the right stuff.

There are some flaws in this concept: it's hard to find ``Call the installed
software in the voting machine,'' because modern computers have many layers
underneath what you examine.  But mainly, if a hacker can corrupt the
vote-tallying software, perhaps they can corrupt the hash-generating
function as well, so that whenever you ask the checker ``does the voting
machine have the right software installed,'' it will say, ``Yes, boss.''
Or, if the hasher is designed not to say ``yes'' or ``no,'' but to
report the hash of what's installed, it can simply report the hash of what's
supposed to be there, not what's actually there. For that reason, election
security experts never put much reliance in this hash-code idea; instead
they insist that you can't fully trust what software is installed, so you
must achieve election integrity by doing recounts or risk-limiting audits of
the paper ballots.

But you might have thought that the hash-code could at least help protect
against accidental, nonmalicious errors in configuration. You would be
wrong. It turns out that [ https://www.essvote.com/ | ES&S ] has bugs in
their hash-code checker: if the ``reference hashcode'' is completely
missing, then it'll say ``yes, boss, everything is fine'' instead of
reporting an error. It's simultaneously shocking and unsurprising that
ES&S's hashcode checker could contain such a blunder and that it would go
unnoticed by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission's federal certification
process. It's unsurprising because testing naturally tends to focus on
``does the system work right when used as intended?'' Using the system in
unintended ways (which is what hackers would do) is not something anyone
will notice.

Until somebody does notice. In this case, it was the State of Texas's
voting-machine examiner, Brian Mechler. In [
https://ftt-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/03172500/brian-mechler-ESS-exam-report-EVS6110-aug.pdf
| his report dated September 2020 ] he found this bug in the hash-checking
script supplied with the ES&S EVS 6.1.1.0 election system (for the
ExpressVote touch-screen BMD, the DS200 in-precinct optical scanner, the
DS450 and DS850 high-speed optical scanners, and other related voting
machines). (Read Section 7.2 of [
https://ftt-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/03172500/brian-mechler-ESS-exam-report-EVS6110-aug.pdf
| Mr. Mechler's report ] for details).

We can't know whether that bug was intentional or not. Either way, it's
certainly convenient for ES&S, because it's one less hassle when installing
firmware upgrades. (Of course, it's one less hassle for potential hackers,
too.)

Another gem in Mr. Mechler's report is in Section 7.1, in which he reveals
that acceptance testing of voting systems is done by the vendor, not by the
customer. Acceptance testing is the process by which a customer checks a
delivered product to make sure it satisfies requirements. To have the vendor
do acceptance testing pretty much defeats the purpose.

When the Texas Secretary of State learned that their vendor was doing the
acceptance testing themselves, the SOS's attorney wrote to ES&S to admonish
them about it, pledging to ensure all Counties amend their procedures to
ensure local officials conduct acceptance testing. The attorney may
encounter a problem, though: the ES&S sales contract specifies that ES&S
must perform the acceptance testing, or they [
https://ftt-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/04141319/48428_2018-241-Contract.pdf
| will void your warranty (see clause 7b) ] .

There's another little gem in Mr. Mechler's report, Section 7.3. The
U.S. Election Assistance Commission requires that `` [
https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/document_library/files/VVSG.1.0_Volume_1.PDF
| The vendor shall have a process to verify that the correct software is
loaded, that there is no unauthorized software, and that voting system
software on voting equipment has not been modified, using the reference
information from the [National Software Reference Library] or from a State
designated repository. The process used to verify software should be
possible to perform without using software installed on the voting system. ]
'' This requirement is usually interpreted to mean, ``check the hash code of
the installed software against the reference hash code held by the EAC or
the State.''

But ES&S's hash-checker doesn't do that at all. Instead, ES&S instructs its
techs to create some ``golden'' hashes from the first installation, then
subsequently check the hash code against these. So whatever software was
first installed gets to be ``golden'', regardless of whether it's been
approved by the EAC or by the State of Texas. This design decision was
probably a convenient shortcut by engineers at ES&S, but it directly
violates the EAC's rules for how hash-checking is supposed to work. So, what
have we learned?

We already knew that hash codes can't protect against hackers who install
vote-stealing software, because the hackers can also install software that
lies about the hash code. But now we've learned that hash codes are even
more useless than we might have thought. This voting-machine manufacturer

 * has a hash-code checker that erroneously reports a match, even when you
   forget to tell it what to match against;
 * checks the hash against what was first installed, not against the
   authorized reference that they're supposed to;
 * and the vendor insists on running this check itself -- not letting the
   customer do it -- otherwise the warranty is voided.

As a bonus we learned that the EAC certifies voting systems without checking
if the validation software functions properly.

Are we surprised? You know: fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame
on me. Every time that we imagine that a voting-machine manufacturer might
have sound cybersecurity practices, it turns out that they've taken
shortcuts and they've made mistakes. In this, voting-machine manufacturers
are no different from any other makers of software. There's lots of insecure
software out there made by software engineers who cut corners and don't pay
attention to security, and why should we think that voting machines are any
different?

So if we want to trust our elections, we should vote on hand-marked paper
ballots, counted by optical scanners, and recountable by hand. Those optical
scanners are pretty accurate when they haven't been hacked -- even the ES&S
DS200 -- and it's impractical to count all the ballots without them. But we
should always check up on the machines by doing random audits of the paper
ballots. And those audits should be ``strong'' enough -- that is, use good
statistical methods and check enough of the ballots -- to catch the mistakes
that the machines might make, if the machines make mistakes (or are
hacked). The technical term for those ``strong enough'' audits is [

Subject: At least 30,000 U.S. organizations newly hacked via holes in
  Microsoft's email software

At least 30,000 organizations across the United States -- including a
significant number of small businesses, towns, cities and local governments
-- have over the past few days been hacked by an unusually aggressive
Chinese cyber-espionage unit that's focused on stealing email from victim
organizations, multiple sources tell KrebsOnSecurity. The espionage group is
exploiting four newly-discovered flaws in *Microsoft Exchange Server* email
software, and has seeded hundreds of thousands of victim organizations
worldwide with tools that give the attackers total, remote control over
affected systems.

On March 2, Microsoft released emergency security updates to plug four
security holes in Exchange Server versions 2013 through 2019 that hackers
were actively using to siphon email communications from Internet-facing
systems running Exchange.
<https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/microsoft-chinese-cyberspies-used-4-exchange-server-flaws-to-plunder-emails/>

In the three days since then, security experts say the same Chinese cyber
espionage group has dramatically stepped up attacks on any vulnerable,
unpatched Exchange servers worldwide.

In each incident, the intruders have left behind a ``web shell,'' an
easy-to-use, password-protected hacking tool that can be accessed over the
Internet from any browser that gives the attackers administrative access to
the victim's computer servers.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, two cybersecurity experts who've briefed
U.S. national security advisors on the attack told KrebsOnSecurity the
Chinese hacking group thought to be responsible has seized control over
*hundreds of thousands* of Microsoft Exchange Servers worldwide -- with each
victim system representing approximately one organization that uses Exchange
to process email.

Microsoft said the Exchange flaws are being targeted by a previously
unidentified Chinese hacking crew it dubbed *Hafnium*, and said the group
had been conducting targeted attacks on email systems used by a range of
industry sectors, including infectious disease researchers, law firms,
higher education institutions, defense contractors, policy think tanks, and
NGOs. [...]

Subject: Re: Post Office scandal (RISKS-32.52)

The issues with the Post Office Horizon POS system and prosecutions and
convictions of subpostmasters for alleged fraud has led to what I believe is
the largest referral of possibly-unsafe cases to the Criminal Cases Review
Commission in UK history.

I and a number of colleagues, namely Martyn Thomas, Bev Littlewood, Harold
Thimbleby and barrister Stephen Mason, have written individually and
collectively, and more recently with others, a number of recent papers about
these cases, published in the University of London School of Advanced
Study's journal Digital Evidence and Electronic Signature Law Review, which
Stephen edits.

Volume 17 contains four papers on this issue by Ladkin et al, Ladkin,
Marshall and Christie https://journals.sas.ac.uk/deeslr/issue/view/578
. Paul Marshall was invited in 2020 to submit some considerations about the
probity of computer evidence to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State
for Justice in the UK Ministry of Justice, Alex Chalk MP. A public version
of this submission (Marshall et al) has been published by DEESLR at
https://journals.sas.ac.uk/deeslr/article/view/5240

There are deeper issues involved in this series of cases than that some
people were unsafely convicted. Readers of the above articles will see that
a certain presumption in English law (since a Law Commission recommendation
in 1997) about the correct/incorrect operation of computers comes into
question (addressed by Ladkin et al, and in the MoJ submission by Marshall
et al). Some of the argumentation used in court was technically
spectacularly poor (cf. Ladkin on "Robustness"). And it came to light in a
civil case brought by a large number of suffering subpostmasters against
Post Office Limited that the developers and operators of the system (Fujitsu
and Post Office Limited) had not disclosed pertinent information about the
dependability of the Horizon system to defendants that Post Office Limited
had prosecuted. Indeed, it is as a result of the superb judgment by Justice
Sir Peter Fraser in that civil case that the large number of convictions
were referred to the CCRC as possibly unsafe. Fraser J's judgment is at
https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bates-v-post-office-judgment.pdf

It is over 300pp long but bears close reading for those interested in the
behaviour of large IT systems; I anticipate it will become a "landmark
judgment".

Because of these deeper issues, I anticipate that these cases will continue
to reverberate for some time in the English judicial system. Some people
have worked on this matter for decades. Stephen Mason is one. He obtained
and published the transcript in DEESLR of the criminal case of subpostmaster
Seema Misra. It is because of Stephen's persistence that Martyn, Bev, Harold
and I became involved. A blog with extensive, detailed references is

The ACH system suffers from having been cutting edge when it was set up, and
is now aging badly. The U.S. is also unique in having over 4000 banks and
5000 credit unions. Some are large and well known but there is a long tail
that are very small and not very sophisticated. (By comparison, France and
the UK each have about 400 banks.) I hear that some of the small banks still
do their ACH transfers with a daily FTP session.

The Federal Reserve is working on a faster and more modern payment system
called FedNow, but the rollout will be slow as all of those tiny banks and
credit unions have to figure it out and get connected.  Since this is the
US, some big banks have a competing system called TCH which they claim is
just as good, no need for FedNow, but it is unlikely to reach all those
small banks, at least not at a price they can afford.

It must be interesting to live in a world where insurance does not exist.

For the most part, it's true, paying the marginal price is more cost
effective. But there is a huge difference between "the most part" and
"always". For the most part, it is more cost effective to pay your medical
bills as they occur rather than paying for insurance. But then you're hit
but a bus, your bills are a million dollars and you do not have a million
dollars. Now what? The market solution is too bad, you die.

In the middle of the freeze, there was no market clearing price. Much of the
cheaply built generation system failed so there was no more power to be had,
while people with electric heat can't just turn it off or they and their
water pipes will freeze. That's why the other 49 states spend money to make
their electric system resilient even though it makes the day to day costs a
little higher. Ask people in El Paso whether they think they'd be better off
with cheaper ERCOT power.
