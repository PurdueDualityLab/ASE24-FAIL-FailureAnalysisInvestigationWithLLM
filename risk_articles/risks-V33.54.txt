I picked this up via Mark E Jeftovic's Axis of Easy, and it's worth paying
attention to:

https://www.zerohedge.com/political/lawsuit-claims-massachusetts-installed-covid-19-spyware-1-million-devices

I merely summarize:

1. Software was installed by Google, sorry, Alphabet on behalf of a
   government without the user's involvement or knowledge;
2. This installation was explicitly hidden from the user;
3  Alphabet appears to have means to enable data downloads explicitly
   against the wishes of the user.

Subject: The airport of the future is the airport of today -- and that's not
 good.  (PapersPlease)

A case study and post-pandemic holday travel horror story:
https://papersplease.org/wp/2022/11/23/the-airport-of-the-future-is-the-airport-of-today-and-thats-not-good/

Today, the day before Thanksgiving, will probably be the busiest day for air
travel in the USA since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020.
If you are flying this week for the first time in three years, what will you
see that has changed?  Unfortunately, many of the most significant changes
made during the pandemic are deliberately invisible -- which is part of that
makes them so evil.

During the pandemic, largely unnoticed, the dystopian surveillance-by design
airport of the future that we've been worried and warning about for many
years has become, in many places, the airport of today.

While travelers were sheltering in place during the COVID-19 pandemic,
airports have taken advantage of the opportunity to move ahead with
expansion and renovation projects. While passenger traffic was reduced,
and terminals and other airport facilities were operating well below
capacity, disruptions due to construction could be minimized.

A characteristic feature of almost all new or newly-renovated major airports
in the U.S. and around the world is that they are designed and built on the
assumption that all passengers' movements within the airport will be tracked
at all times, and that all phases of passenger processing will be carried
out automatically using facial recognition.

In the airport of the future, or in a growing number of present-day
airports, there's no need for a government agency or airline that wants to
use facial recognition to install cameras or data links for that purpose.
As in the new International Arrivals Facility at Sea-Tac Airport, which
opened this year, the cameras and connectivity are built into the facility
as common-use public-private infrastructure shared by airlines, government
agencies, and the operator of the airport -- whether that's a public agency
(as with almost all U.S. airports) or a private company (as with many
foreign airports).

This integrated and as-invisible-as-possible surveillance infrastructure
exemplifies the malign convergence of interests between government agencies
that want to identify and track travelers for pre-crime predictive profiling
and control, and airlines and airports (motivated by business efficiency
even when they are operated by instrumentalities of state and local
governments) that want to use the same hardware, and data from government ID
databases, for business process automation and revenue maximization.

That malign convergence of interests extends to an interest in making
surveillance tech inconspicuous and, if it is visible at all, making it
appear normal and unavoidable. Neither government agencies nor travel
companies nor airports want travelers to notice or question what is
happening, or want to take responsibility for it. If travelers ask
questions, airlines want to be able to answer, ``the Federal government made
us do it'', even if that isn't true (as it unquestionably isn't for
U.S. citizens or any domestic flyers within the U.S.).

The integration of facial recognition into the airport structure makes these
surveillance systems and practices much less visible -- by design -- than
retrofitted or standalone surveillance cameras.  Their positioning along the
flow of passengers from airport entrance to aircraft door makes it almost
impossible to pass through the airport and board a plane without being
photographed, identified, and tracked.

Opting out is, in these new airports and terminals, a purely theoretical
option for travelers who already know their rights (without being given
notice of them), figure out how to assert them (again without notice) and
who are willing to put up with additional questioning, search, and/or delay.

Subject: The World Generates So Much Data, New Unit Measurements Were
 Created to Keep Up (NPR)

Ashley Ahn, NPR, 19 Nov 2022

Four new prefixes to the International System of Units were announced by the
27th General Conference on Weights and Measures on 18 Nov 2022, marking the
first expansion of the metric system since 1991. The new prefixes are ronna
(27 zeroes after the first digit) and quetta (30 zeroes) at the top of the
measurement range, and ronto (27 zeroes after the decimal point) and quecto
(30 zeroes) at the bottom.  Said the UK's National Physical Laboratory
(NPL), "The change was largely driven by the growing requirements of data
science and digital storage, which is already using prefixes at the top of
the existing range (yottabytes and zettabytes, for expressing huge
quantities of digital information)." NPL indicated ronto and quecto will be
useful in quantum science and particle physics.

  [And of course it will never stop.  Y'otta do something abyte it.  Maybe
  ronna contest for the next prefixes, send a ronto to toRonto, hold a
  ban-quetta.  We already have the Irish Zetta.  I wonder how many people
  will confuse ronna and ronto.  PGN]

Subject: Twitter, Mastodon Handle, and App

I think we're seeing an Elon Musk blindspot. Essentially: he's purchased a
*social network*, but seems to think that the secret to making it work is
the same as the solution for Tesla and SpaceX -- namely: excellent
engineering. Undoubtedly, there are ways to improve the Twitter platform,
as Mudge has pointed out. But what has kept users coming to Twitter and
*giving it* high-quality content is the social network bit, not the
platform, per se. It is having people you respect there, alongside you,
sharing ideas and engaging in conversations. Musk -- who is clearly not
gifted in person-to-person interactions -- just misses that. That's also why
he doesn't see why the *TwitChan* platform he's unleashed, in which trolls
hurl racial, misogynistic and antisemitic epithets, conspiracy theories, and
unbridled hate speech without consequence will drive people *away* from the
commons rather than draw them to it.

You can have an amazing social media platform, but without creatives to
provide it with content, Twitter is doomed. Looking at Twitter purely from
the engineering/coding perspective misses this bigger, deeper *truth* for
Twitter. Alas, Musk has missed the window to get this right, hold on to the
critical 10% of creatives and thinkers who provide 90% of the content and
promote Twitter as a "pro social" platform with -- perhaps -- a slightly
more coarse filter (literally).

Next stop: bankruptcy.

  [Borrowed with permission from another group.  New-ants instead of Nuance?
  Although `formal' is not the root of formaldahyde, `formic' is the root of
  all ants.  Perhaps twitter should be embalmed, and placed in its full
  nakedness on permanent public view for all to see.  PGN]

Subject: Idle Crypto Is the Devil's Workshop (The New YorkTimes)

The newest monetary system in the world may be undone by the oldest problem
there is.

A few weeks ago, Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX cryptocurrency exchange collapsed
in a classic run. Investors were spooked by evidence that the exchange had
mismanaged their money and couldn't pay them back, so they panicked. And
they were right. They couldn't get their money back.

The blockchain technology behind cryptocurrency was supposed to make events
like this a thing of the past. But FTX's business was to serve as a gateway
into (and out of) cryptocurrency. That business still depends on humans to
serve as honest gatekeepers. And we've seen over and over that humans can't
resist the main temptation that comes with this role: to use their
customers' money for their own purposes.

From: Lauren Weinstein <lauren@vortex.com>
Subject: Elon's phone confusion

It was amusing yesterday hearing Musk talking about "building his own phone"
if #Twitter is tossed from the #Apple and #Google app stores for violations
of their Terms of Service. Notably, his comment gives us instant insight
into his lack of knowledge in this area. Let's review:

1) There was already supposed to be a Tesla Pi phone to be available by
perhaps the end of this year. Maybe it will arrive in a fully self-driving
Tesla without a human driver.

2) He doesn't actually need to build his own phone. If he wants an Elon
phone, he could just rebrand one of the many Chinese Android clone phones
(though notably, most of these will not have Play Store access, see below).

3) The phone isn't the problem for a toxic Twitter. The *ecosystems* are the
issue. The Apple and Google smartphones ecosystems are built to provide
end-to-end security for apps, best effort protection against malware (e.g.,
Google's Play Store "Play Protect" that scans apps for malware), and so
on. If an app is not in the app stores, you can't easily run that app. Sure,
Elon could sell a clone phone with his pay-to-play Twitter app already
installed, but that phone would not be expected to have access to the Google
Play Store for other apps unless they were preloaded also. Now you also need
an update mechanism for the apps. Essentially, you have to build an entire
new ecosystem.

4) Apple currently locks down their iOS devices tightly against non-app
store apps. This will be changing with new EU rules coming into force. On
the other hand, Google has always permitted sideloading of (non-Play Store)
Android apps by knowledgeable users. Technically, Elon could promote users
sideloading a Twitter app on Android (and presumably eventually iOS) to
bypass app store restrictions. However, there is definitely significantly
increased friction and potential for user confusion in this model.

5) We've heard Elon complain about the cut that the Apple and Google app
stores take from app revenues. This of course only is an issue if your app
isn't free and/or is charging users for something. This tends to validate
the observation that Elon wants to turn all Twitter users into an ongoing
profit center -- thus his talk about crypto, banking, etc. via Twitter, and
his "anything app" fixation. While he may be able to convince significant
numbers of users to pay him continuously for now worthless blue checks, the
extent to which large numbers of Internet users will want to participate in
a "your entire life belongs to Elon" app/banking ecosystem remains to be
seen. -L

Carbon offsetting

<https://t.sidekickopen84.com/s3t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8bWDTTW1C5FXw59hl3kW7_k2841CX6NGN36PYCpvfv7lW7vZ0Py3jpv0Sf197v5Y04?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW4mKLS-4cRxF8W3F7sbd3ZSz4qW3FbmCt3XvbfRW3K3psD3K76ZWW3P8KrX3zgCBpW41p0wR3M7MSgf4fJfX_V3&si=8000000023715636&pi=b900d744-9de6-431f-eb58-041670f2b14f>

Projects estimate the emissions they have prevented by predicting how much
deforestation and land clearing would have occurred without them. The
reductions are then sold on as credits. We found their predictions were
often inconsistent with previous levels of deforestation in the area and in
some cases, the threat to the trees may have been overstated.

There is a reason that Indigenous Environmental Network and Indigenous
Climate Action held a protest against offsetting at COP26, the UN's annual
climate conference: Offsetting incentivises the commodification of nature
and allows powerful corporations to take over the lands of vulnerable
communities, risking human rights abuses. Offset schemes often exclude local
and Indigenous Peoples from land management practises that allow them to
grow food and preserve biodiversity.

A research on programs in the Brazilian Amazon headed by scientist and
former project inspector Thales West discovered that initiatives
consistently misrepresented their carbon reductions. The procedures, he
claimed, ``are not robust enough, leaving room for projects to obtain credits
that have no influence at all on the environment.''
