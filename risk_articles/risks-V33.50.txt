Subject: Science Has a Nasty Photoshopping Problem (Elisabeth Bik)

Elisabeth Bik, *The New York Times*, 29 Oct 2022

If this 'scientific disinformation' problem isn't stopped quickly, the
recent rejections of COVID science will seem a walk in the park.

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/29/opinion/science-fraud-image-manipulation-photoshop.html

One evening in January 2014, I sat at my computer at home, sifting through
scientific papers. Being a microbiologist, this wasn't unusual, although I
certainly didn't expect to find what I did that night.

These particular papers were write-ups of medical research, with many
including photographs of biological samples, like tissue. One picture caught
my eye. Was there something familiar about it? Curious, I quickly scrolled
back through other papers by the same authors, checking their images against
each other.

There it was. A section of the same photo being used in two different
papers to represent results from three entirely different experiments.

What's more, the authors seemed to be deliberately covering their
tracks. Although the photos were of the same sample, one appeared to have
been flipped back-to-front, while the other appeared to have been stretched
and cropped differently.

Although this was eight years ago, I distinctly recall how angry it made me.
This was cheating, pure and simple. By editing an image to produce a desired
result, a scientist can manufacture proof for a favored hypothesis, or
create a signal out of noise. Scientists must rely on and build on one
another's work. Cheating is a transgression against everything that science
should be. If scientific papers contain errors or -- much worse --
fraudulent data and fabricated imagery, other researchers are likely to
waste time and grant money chasing theories based on made-up results.

But were those duplicated images just an isolated case? With little clue
about how big this would get, I began searching for suspicious figures in
biomedical journals.  [...[

By day I went to my job in a lab at Stanford University, but I was soon
spending every evening and most weekends looking for suspicious images. In
2016, I published an analysis of 20,621 peer-reviewed papers, discovering
problematic images in *no fewer than one in 25*. Half of these appeared to
have been manipulated deliberately &mdash; rotated, flipped, stretched or
otherwise photoshopped. With a sense of unease about how much bad science
might be in journals, I quit my full-time job in 2019 so that I could devote
myself to finding and reporting more cases of scientific fraud.

  [Elisabeth appears to be a very gifted sleuth-sayer!]

Subject: 'Deepfakes' of Celebrities Appearing in Ads (Patrick Coffee)

Patrick Coffee, *The Wall Street Journal*, 25 Oct 2022,
via ACM TechNews; 26 Oct 2022

Deepfakes of celebrities have started to appear in ads, with and without
their consent. Experts say the growing use of deepfake software could change
the marketing industry significantly while raising new legal and ethical
issues, making it difficult for celebrities to rein in unauthorized digital
reproductions and brand manipulation. U.S. legislative efforts to contain
deepfakes include criminalization of their use in revenge porn in Virginia,
and a Texas ban on their use in political campaigns. However, experts cite a
lack of legislation addressing deepfake usage in commercials, and anticipate
as a result deepfakes will become increasingly popular in advertising.

2. How to report hate speech, etc. on Twitter to Google Play Store
https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2853570?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid

3. In all seriousness, I wish only the best for @Twitter -- and despite
   Musk's dramatic flare the most interesting thing to watch will be the
   degree to which he acknowledges his lack of experience in this area and
   reaches out to experts who understand the national and global
   implications. -L

4. Musk starts firing execs, having them thrown out of the offices REPORT:
   CEO, CFO, top legal and policy exec, and general counsel fired, one
   "escorted" out of the office. Unclear if he was handcuffed.
     [Twitter informs me that news stories claiming firing of data engineering
     team are FALSE.  -L]

7. Twitter Debates Musk's Proposed 'Moderation Council' as Users Volunteer
https://www.newsweek.com/twitter-debates-musks-proposed-moderation-council-users-volunteer-1755546

9. My sense at the moment is that Twitter under Musk would continue to
   moderate hate speech per se pretty much as they have, but tend to let
   disinformation run amok. The latter has much more potential to have
   political impact, and "fits the profile" so to speak. -L

10. Elon Musk tells Europe that Twitter will comply with bloc's illegal
   speech rules
https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-twitter-dsa-comply/

11. Hate speech vs. disinformation

   There is of course a hazy gray area between hate speech and
   disinformation, and it can be assumed that this will be exploited to the
   maximal extent possible for evil. -L

12. Revenue idea for Elon's Twitter!

   Revenue idea for @Twitter - charge per original tweet sent & number of
   followers. Charging algorithm will add 100x weight for each blue check
   recipient. Average tweet across platform would cost ~$5. You can rake it
   in Elon! Tesla & SpaceX will be revenue babes in comparison! -L

13. Bailing out Elon

   Keep in mind the bottom line. Musk has admitted that he overpaid for
   @Twitter -- and now he wants us to pay for it and essentially bail out
   the richest man on the planet. What's wrong with this picture?

  [Also: Gabe Goldberg:

  Valley moguls used to buy yachts and islands. Now they are rich enough,
  and perhaps arrogant enough, to acquire companies they fancy.

Subject: Facebook's Ad-Delivery Algorithm Discriminates Based on Race,
 Gender, Age (Northeastern)

Cody Mello-Klein, News@Northeastern, 25 Oct 2022,
via ACM TechNews; 26 Oct 2022

Northeastern University researchers found Facebook's ad-delivery algorithm
sends advertising to users based on their race, gender, and age. For
example, "When you choose to include a picture of a woman versus a man, in
general it will go more to women, except images of young women, which go
more to older men," explained Northeastern's Alan Mislove. Facebook's
algorithm is trained on the data parent company Meta has collected from all
ads run on the platform and the responses those ads received. Northeastern's
Piotr Sapiezynski said the algorithm uses race, gender, and age to make
"very crude" estimations about where to transmit ads.

Subject: Confirming Election Results with Risk-Limiting Audits (Rice U.)

Mike Williams, Rice University News, 24 Oct 2022,
via ACM TechNews; 26 Oct 2022

Rice University's Dan Wallach, working with Matthew Bernhard at nonprofit
VotingWorks, found risk-limiting audits (RLAs) can be used to confirm
election outcomes. Bernhard said RLAs offer "a high degree of accuracy and
transparency without the enormous undertaking that is counting every contest
on every ballot by hand." The researchers said most scenarios would fit one
of three RLA levels. Ballot comparison audits, described as most efficient
and precise, involve paper ballots being individually numbered by the ballot
scanner, so auditors can verify the corresponding electronic record. Less
precise are ballot-polling audits, which compare a random sample of ballots
to electronic totals, and batch comparison audits, which compare groups of
ballots.

Subject: Self-Driving Cars Face Uncertain Path to U.S. Deployment (Reuters)

David Shepardson, Reuters. 28 Oct 2022, via ACM TechNews, 31 Oct 2022

The difficult path to deploying autonomous vehicles (AVs) was highlighted by
an announcement on Oct. 26 that Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG would close
their self-driving startup Argo AI, citing the fact that the technology is
still a long way off. This comes as legislation to amend regulations to
include self-driving cars remains stalled in Congress, and officials at the
U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) have not
revealed when they might act on petitions to grant initial approval to
self-driving vehicles without human controls. Meanwhile, lawmakers and
industry representatives have called on U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete
Buttigieg to develop a comprehensive federal framework for AVs to ensure the
nation remains competitive, especially as China has made substantial
investments in autonomous and connected vehicle technologies.

Subject: Re: NYC's Emerg. Med. Svc 911 system was crippled 'cuz ...
 (RISKS-33.49)

This type of snafu was much more common prior to (guess what) Y2K?  In the
years 1998 and 1999, countless computer systems, and their backups were
re-evaluated.  In many cases, they were replaced.  Y2K was a grand excuse
for IT departments to receive generous funding for modernization.  Prior to
then, they had to live with "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."

Prior to 2000, backups were so poorly designed and poorly tested, that
comedic outcomes were almost the norm.  After 2000 less so.  The pinnacle of
success came on 9/11/2001, when the operations centers of hundreds of vial
companies were destroyed.  Every one of them, without exception, transferred
to off-site backups within seconds.  I'm sure that if the attack had
happened prior to 1998, the outcome would have been very different.  The
power grid also was able to contain blackouts to the destroyed city blocks.
There were zero cascading failures.

Of course, prior to 2000 we had companies like Tandem Computers and Digital
Equipment Corporation that offered superbly reliable computers able to fail
over to backups including off-site backups.  However, those technologies
were only used in a tiny fraction of all installations.

If the NYC 911 center was truly modern, that EPO button would have been
pressed dozens of times during acceptance testing, and probably once per
month during testing of fail over to backups.
