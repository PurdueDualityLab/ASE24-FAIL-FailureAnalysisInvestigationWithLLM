Subject: Denver was ground zero for CenturyLink's recent network outage
  ... and it can be explained by a Mickey Mouse movie (Aldo Svladi)

Aldo Svaldi, *The Denver Post*, 11 Jan 2019

https://www.denverpost.com/2019/01/11/centurylink-network-outage-denver/

For about 30 hours, from the early morning hours of Dec. 27 until late on
Dec. 28, chaos reigned on CenturyLink's system. Western states that depend
most heavily on the company's fiber-optic system were hardest hit, but
reports of outages and slower speeds came in from Alaska to Florida,
according to downdetector.com.

"CenturyLink experienced a network event on one of our six transport
networks beginning on December 27 that impacted voice, IP, and transport
services for some of our customers. The event also impacted CenturyLink’s
visibility into our network management system, impairing our ability to
troubleshoot and prolonging the duration of the outage," the company said in
a statement.

Technicians were left scrambling trying to pinpoint the root cause, and that
resulted in them losing time on fixes that didn't work. New Orleans as
ground zero was an early suspect, and then it was San Antonio, Texas. Teams,
which had to make physical site visits, went into action in Kansas City,
Mo., and then Atlanta, and so on.

But as they tried fixes in different areas, the problem didn't go away.
Making matters worse, the reporting system that gathered customer complaints
also failed.

The source of all that turmoil and hours of angst for affected customers
came down to one piece of equipment —- a faulty third-party network
management card in Denver, according to the company.

Subject: Lauren's Blog: Finally, Some Good News About the EU's Horrendous
  "Right To Be Forgotten" Law

via NNSquad
https://lauren.vortex.com/2019/01/10/finally-some-good-news-about-the-eus-horrendous-right-to-be-forgotten-law

I've been highly critical -- to say the least -- of the European Union's
insane global censorship regime -- "The Right To Be Forgotten" (RTBF) --
since well before it became actual, enacted law.

But there's finally some good news about RTBF -- in the form of a formal
opinion from EU Advocate General Maciej Szpunar, chief adviser at Europe's
highest court.

I'm not sure offhand when I first began writing about the monstrosity that
is RTBF, but a small subset of related posts includes:

The "Right to Be Forgotten": A Threat We Dare Not Forget (2/2012):
https://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000938.html

Why the "Right To Be Forgotten" is the Worst Kind of Censorship (8/2015):
https://lauren.vortex.com/archive/001119.html

RTBF was always bad, but it became a full-fledged dumpster fire when (as
many of us had predicted from the beginning) efforts were made to enforce
its censorship demands globally. This gave the EU effectively worldwide
censorship powers via RTBF's "hide the library index cards" approach,
creating a lowest common denominator "race to the bottom" of expanding mass,
government-directed censorship of search results related to usually
completely accurate and still published news and other information items.

In a nutshell, Maciej Szpunar's opinion -- which is not binding but is
likely to be a strong indicator of how related final decisions will turn out
-- is that global application of EU RTBF decisions is usually unreasonable.
While he doesn't rule out the possibility of global "enforcement" in
"certain situations" (an aspect that will need to be clarified), it's
obvious that he views routine global enforcement of EU RTBF demands to be
untenable.

This is of course only a first step toward reining in the RTBF monster, but
it's potentially an enormously important one, and we'll be watching further
developments in this arena with great interest indeed.

Subject: Is it time for Linux?

For decades, Microsoft products have been very vulnerable to viruses and
other exploits. This does not seem to be a solvable problem.

For over two decades, I have used Linux in some form as my primary laptop
or desktop OS, mostly because I'm old enough to have grown up with Unix and
VMS. Back in the day, I would use a Windows VM as a way to run products
like MS-Office, but now the open source alternatives have gotten to the
point where I never do so -- car diagnostic software is the only reason to
fire up the VM. LibreOffice is more compatible with MS-Office than
Microsoft's own Office:mac

Many years ago, Linux support for hardware was variable, now it's rarely a
concern. Installs and upgrades were awkward, now Ubuntu is very slick, and
easy for IT to manage centrally.

The need for Windows to support fat client business software is far less,
as most applications are now thin client requiring only a good browser
(Chrome) and indeed in the cloud.

Is it time for the security community to recommend "run Linux if you can?"

Subject: 'Chipping' Is the Next Frontier for Biohackers (Fortune)

The incredibly promising business behind people injecting themselves with
microchips. Bye-bye keys, passwords, and tickets -- they're all on the chip.

Down a narrow side street in the Swedish city of Gothenburg sits the
Barbarella piercing parlor, a regular haunt for locals who decorate their
bodies with piercings and tattoos, and which claims to offer the area;s
finest collection of ear discs and nose rings. But on a frigid evening in
November, the shop is the setting for a very different kind of body
enhancement: biochips. As darkness falls on the port town of nearly 600,000
people, Jowan Ã\226sterlund wanders in, wearing a baseball cap and
T-shirt, to meet two new clients for his small startup, Â­Biohax
International. From his backpack, he pulls plastic-wrapped syringes, each
containing a tiny, dark microchip that is barely visible from the
outside. Inside the unassuming package is Ãsterlund's prized product, a
window into what today is a fringe tech obsession but which, he believes,
will one day be a giant industry. ``You are creating an entirely new type of
behavior and entirely new types of data that will be massively more valuable
than what we have now.  It is kind of a moonshot. But in the long run, this
is what is going to happen.''

Subject: For Owners of Amazon's Ring Security Cameras, Strangers May Have
  Been Watching (The Intercept)

The `smart home' [isn't] just supposed to be a monument to convenience,
weâre told, but also to protection, a Tony Stark-like bubble of vigilant
algorithms and Internet-connected sensors working ceaselessly to watch over
us.  But for some who've welcomed in Amazon's Ring security cameras, there
have been more than just algorithms watching through the lens, according to
sources alarmed by Ring's dismal privacy practices.

Ring has a history of lax, sloppy oversight when it comes to deciding who
has access to some of the most precious, intimate data belonging to any
person: a live, high-definition feed from around -- and perhaps inside --
their house. The company has marketed its line of miniature cameras,
designed to be mounted as doorbells, in garages, and on bookshelves, not
only as a means of keeping tabs on your home while you're away, but of
creating a sort of privatized neighborhood watch, a constellation of
overlapping camera feeds that will help police detect and apprehend burglars
(and worse) as they approach.  ``Our mission to reduce crime in
neighborhoods has been at the core of everything we do commemorate the
company's reported $1 billion acquisition payday from Amazon, a company with
its own recent history of troubling facial recognition practices. The
marketing is working; Ring is a consumer hit and a press darling.

Despite its mission to keep people and their property secure, the company's
treatment of customer video feeds has been anything but, people familiar
with the company's practices told The Intercept.  Beginning in 2016,
according to one source, Ring provided its Ukraine-based research and
development team virtually unfettered access to a folder on Amazon's S3
cloud storage service that contained every video created by every Ring
camera around the world. This would amount to an enormous list of highly
sensitive files that could be easily browsed and viewed. Downloading and
sharing these customer video files would have required little more than a
click. The Information, which has aggressively covered Ring's security
lapses, reported on these practices last month.

Dan Goodin, Ars Technica, 7 Jan 2019

Governments and police forces around the world are trying harder than ever
to exploit software that is becoming increasingly difficult to compromise.
Market-leading software exploit broker Zerodium recently said it would pay
up to $2 million for zero-click jailbreaks of Apple's iOS, $1.5 million for
one-click iOS jailbreaks, and $1 million for exploits that take over
security messaging apps WhatsApp and iMessage. These prices are up about
$500,000 from previous levels, an indication that the demand for them
continues to grow, and that reliable exploitation of these targets is
becoming increasingly difficult. Zerodium said it sells the exploits only to
lawful governments, although it has never provided details to verify those
claims.

prosecutors working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, after
agreeing to cooperate with their investigation into Russian interference in
the election.

A prohibitionist campaign appeared to be led by supporters of the Republican
Senate candidate in 2017. But it was created by progressives -- the second
such secret effort to be unmasked.

Google search results listings can be manipulated for propaganda
Dutch researcher argues that Google should remove support for knowledge panels.

opening text:

A feature of the Google search engine lets threat actors alter search
results in a way that could be used to push political propaganda, oppressive
views, or promote fake news.

The feature is known as the "knowledge panel", and is a box that usually
appears at the right side of the search results, usually highlighting the
main search result for a very specific query.

  [The article then gives details that, while I have not tried this myself,
  appear to suffice to reproduce the problem.]

Subject: Why it pays to declutter your digital life (bbc.com)

http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190104-are-you-a-digital-hoarder

"With the storage capacity of our devices increasing with every upgrade and
cloud storage plans costing peanuts, it might not seem like a problem to
hold on to thousands of emails, photos, documents and various other digital
belongings.

"But emerging research on digital hoarding -- a reluctance to get rid of the
digital clutter we accumulate through our work and personal lives --
suggests that it can make us feel just as stressed and overwhelmed as
physical clutter. Not to mention the cybersecurity problems it can cause for
individuals and businesses and the way it makes finding that one email you
need sometimes seem impossible."

Digital storage ubiquity promotes monomaniacal behavior.

Is that the Google that removes the little padlock icon from their browser
because "the web is now safe by default"? The one that's pushing https down
our throats to ensure the ads we (don't) see came from bona fide
Google-paying advertisers?

Was it Bruce Schneier who said this isn't techno-feudalism because in
feudalism the feudal actually had obligations towards his vassals?

No obligation indeed.

The initial role of the Internet (in its first incarnation as Arpanet) was
to provide a medium, detached from the phone network, for secure and stable
communication even during a nuclear emergency.

It's ironic is that the same network had become a Trojan horse within the
US national security infrastructure.

Subject: Re: USA Wants to Restrict AI Exports: A Stupid and Dangerous Idea
  (RISKS-31.01)

This is yet another symptom of the "US first" fallacy.  Such laws and
regulations are based on an inherent assumption that the US is first in
everything, so any new technology would be made in the USA, and the only way
adversaries could get it is by export from the USA.

During the encryption exports craze of the 1980's, I came into the US
carrying a computer board for an exhibition; I was employed by an American
company, but the board was designed and built in their Israeli branch.  When
leaving the US, I was stopped by customs -- it seems the board's CPU was too
fast, so it was categorized as an encryption device.  I had no problem just
leaving it there, we had plenty more back home.  (I have no idea if the
company had ever redeemed the board, it may sill be stored in some customs
warehouse at JFK).
