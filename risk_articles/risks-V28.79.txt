Subject: The Golden Age of Surveillance (Peter Swire)

Peter Swire, *Slate*, 15 Jul 2015
The government doesn't need to weaken encryption -- it already has the tools
it needs to catch criminals.
http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2015/07/encryption_back_doors_aren_t_necessary_we_re_already_in_a_golden_age_of.html

   [Excerpt:]

... the Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology report,
released in December 2013, unanimously and clearly recommended that the
U.S. government vigorously encourage the use of strong encryption, stating:

  We recommend that, regarding encryption, the US Government should:

  (1) fully support and not undermine efforts to create encryption standards;

  (2) not in any way subvert, undermine, weaken, or make vulnerable
      generally available commercial software; and

  (3) increase the use of encryption and urge US companies to do so, in
      order to better protect data in transit, at rest, in the cloud, and in
      other storage.

  With full awareness of the `going dark' concerns, we sharply criticized
  any attempt to introduce vulnerabilities into commercially available
  products and services, and found that even temporary vulnerabilities
  should be authorized only after administration-wide scrutiny.  Based on
  the top-secret briefings and our experience, we found these policies would
  best fight cybercrime, improve cybersecurity, build trust in the global
  communications infrastructure, and promote national security.

  At heart, providing access exceptions for U.S. law enforcement and
  intelligence agencies will be harmful, rather than helpful, to national
  security.  The inability to directly access the content of a small
  fraction of these communications does not warrant the subsequent damage
  that would result to privacy and to U.S. economic, diplomatic, and
  security interests.

Peter Swire is the Huang professor of law and ethics at the Georgia
Institute of Technology, senior counsel with Alston & Bird LLP, and a
cyber-fellow with New America.

Designing in Reverse

Utah unveiled the latest iteration of its portal in April, with a new
mobile-first design that uses analytics to provide citizens an online
experience that's localized, personalized and individualized.  ``We are
trying to make Utah.gov something that will stand out for people, keep them
coming back and help them navigate as easily as possible,'' said Utah CTO
Dave Fletcher.  The state also worked to make the redesigned site truly
device agnostic, so it adjusts dynamically and automatically based on the
user. To accomplish this, the portal was designed in reverse. Rather than
creating a wireframe of the site's look and then coding to match that look,
they started with the coding and didn't get to see how the site looked until
later.

*According to *The New York Times*, U.S. government officials will soon
announce all the improvements their IT security teams have made to federal
systems in response to the OPM breach. Unfortunately, says the Times, these
updates only just scratch the surface, and are more to show that the
government is "doing something" than to fix the long-standing problems with
how it handles security. "After neglect that has been documented in dozens
of audits for nearly two decades, the federal government is still far behind
its adversaries. And it is still struggling to procure the latest
technological defenses or attract the kind of digital security expertise
necessary to secure its networks."  It seems each agency has to be hit by a
cyberattack, causing it to go into panic-mode independently, before learning
to properly safeguard its systems. Officials say far too much money is
wasted on figuring out who and what to blame, rather than on ameliorating
the problem. "At the Internal Revenue Service, auditors identified 69
vulnerabilities in the agency's networks last year, but when officials there
told Government Accountability Office auditors this year that they had fixed
24 of those problems, investigators found only 14 had been resolved."*

In the month since a devastating computer systems breach at the Office of
Personnel Management, digital SWAT teams have been racing to plug the most
glaring security holes in government computer networks and prevent another
embarrassing theft of personal information, financial data and national

(Russia Beyond the Headlines):
http://rbth.com/politics/2015/07/14/controversial_new_law_on_right_to_be_forgotten_stirs_debate_in_russi_47745.html

  Russia has adopted a law on the so-called "right to be forgotten," which
  will require internet search engines to remove links to personal
  information at the request of citizens.  Although State Duma deputies
  claim the legislation mirrors that of the European Union, industry players
  strongly oppose the law, predicting a series of lawsuits, while lawyers
  say that such a right is unconstitutional and express concern that the law
  will be used by prominent individuals to selectively edit their past.

Subject: Gun-Firing Drone Raises Some Eyebrows

A video posted on YouTube showing a drone firing a gun in a wooded area has
caused some controversy today.  The short video shows a four-rotored custom
drone with a special rig containing a handgun. The handgun proceeds to fire
four shots, handling the recoil better than might be expected. The user who
posted the video also submitted it to Reddit, where a commenter noted that
the apparent use of a solenoid trigger would class the device as an
automatic weapon under ATF rules.

The Intercept reports: "The plan is described in internal emails from the
Italian company Hacking Team, which makes off-the-shelf software that can
remotely infect a suspect's computer or smartphone, accessing files and
recording calls, chats, emails and more. A hacker attacked the Milan-based
firm earlier this month and released hundreds of gigabytes of company
information online. Among the emails is a recap of a meeting in June of this
year, which gives a "roadmap" of projects that Hacking Team's engineers have
underway. On the list: Develop a way to infect computers via drone. One
engineer is assigned the task of developing a "mini" infection device, which
could be "ruggedized" and "transportable by drone (!)" the write-up notes
enthusiastically in Italian. The request appears to have originated with a
query from the Washington-based Insitu, which makes a range of unmanned
systems, including the small ScanEagle surveillance drone, which has long
been used by the militaries of the U.S. and other countries. Insitu also
markets its drones for law enforcement."

  "Notice of policy update"

  We value our relationship with you and work hard to communicate clearly.
  Recently, however, we did not live up to our own standards.

  Earlier this year, we sent you an email about updates that we planned to
  make to our User Agreement on July 1, 2015. The User Agreement is a
  document we share to help you understand your relationship with PayPal and
  the obligations we both have.

  Unfortunately, some of the language in this update caused confusion and
  concern with some of our customers about how we may contact you.

  To clear up any confusion, we have modified the terms of Section 1.10 of
  our User Agreement. The new language is intended to make it clear that
  PayPal primarily uses autodialed or prerecorded calls and texts to:

     Help detect, investigate and protect our customers from fraud
     Provide notices to our customers regarding their accounts or
       account activity
     Collect a debt owed to us

  In addition, the new Section 1.10(a) and 1.10(b) makes it clear that:

     We will not use autodialed or prerecorded calls or texts to contact
  our customers for marketing purposes without prior express written consent.
     Customers can continue to enjoy our products and services without
  needing to consent to receive autodialed or prerecorded calls or texts.
     We respect our customers' communications preferences and recognize
  that their consent is required for certain autodialed and prerecorded
  calls and texts. Customers may revoke consent to receive these
  communications by contacting PayPal customer support and informing us of
  their preferences.

  Agreement below and by clicking on the links at the bottom of this

  We apologize for any confusion we may have caused. Should you have any
  additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to our customer

  Last month, Parsley presented Depict, a crowd-sourced image description
  tool that could change the experience of the browsing the web for the
  blind and visually impaired. The tool works in two parts--a browser
  extension for blind users that provides user-created descriptions of
  images around the Internet, and a website for sighted users to provide
  those requested descriptions. If a blind user clicks on an image of an
  apple tree, which is not properly described in the HTML code, the photo
  will appear on the crowd-sourced website where sighted users can write
  "apple tree." The highest rated description based on sighted user votes
  will then replace the original description, and be read aloud to any blind
  user that scrolls over the photograph in the future. Parsley's husband
  Jason Sanders helped her develop the final iteration of Depict, which is
  now available as an extension on Google Chrome browsers.

Subject: Heartbleed and beyond: Marine Corps 'cyber range' trains to
  fight off hackers

  [This sure is vague about exactly what this "range" consists of...]

A virtual training range developed for the Marine Corps to prepare troops
for cyber operations has been adapted to do everything from prepare for
offensive actions to secure networks defensively against hacking threats
like the Heartbleed security bug, Marine officials said.

The network was established by defense contractor ManTech within the last
year at a cost of about $9.1 million. Maintained at an office park just
south of Marine Corps Base Quantico, Va., it is used to train not only
troops who focus on cyber operations, but Marines who focus on
communications, intelligence and operational planning.

"Conceptually people might have a harder time picturing this battle space,
but it is battle space," said Col. Gregory T. Breazile, the director of the
service's cyber and electronic warfare integration division, in an
interview. "When we in the Marine Corps look at maneuver warfare, this is
maneuver warfare. It's fighting the enemy's weak points and exploiting those
weak points so that you can defeat your adversary."

Subject: Civil Liability for End2End Encryption? (Conor Friedersdorf)

  [FYI -- OK, if we're going to have civil liability for end-to-end
  encryption, then it should go both ways; those who screw up customers'
  encryption should also have to pay -- e.g., OPM, Sony, Target,
  Neiman-Marcus, etc. -- and a lousy few hundred dollars for "credit
  monitoring" isn't nearly enough by orders of magnitude.  I suspect that
  the vast majority of the money will go to the Neiman customers rather than
  to kidnap victims' parents.]

Do Encrypted Phones Threaten National Security?
A legislator compares manufacturing devices with strong, end-to-end
encryption to dumping toxic waste in a stream.

Subject: Re: Securing networks is harder than it was two years ago (R-28.78)
  (BetaNews)

What does it mean to "secure a network"? Is this like securing glass and
copper?

It's not that networks are harder to secure -- the increased use of
connectivity exposes the naiveté inherent in the idea of securing the
network. This isn't as much a technical issues as a social problem as we
come to terms with the new topologies of relationships.

Of course this is about marketing a particular solution as if automation is
answer. People tend to forget that those algorithms amplify our naiveté
as well as our understanding.
