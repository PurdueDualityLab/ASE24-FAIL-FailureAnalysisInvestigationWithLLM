That a kill switch cannot be prophylacticly applied to all non-emergency
vehicles in the vicinity of a protest exposes pedestrian marchers to heinous
and violent reprisals. A localized kill switch won't halt a '63 Chevy
Impala.

Kill switch vulnerabilities have appeared repeatedly in comp.risks:

https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/27/11#subj3.1
https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/27/84#subj10.1

https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/28/25#subj5.1
https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/30/29#subj4.1

In https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/28/25#subj5.1, Jonathan Zittrain
<zittrain@law.harvard.edu> states:

  "I know I've long inveighed against vendor (and, by proxy, government)
  control over consumer technology, and I still think that's a central
  threat to both open code and free speech. But all of that
  otherwise-worrisome tech applied to weapons seems to invert the equities."

Given that kill switches are not readily viable solutions: Laying traffic
spikes across intersections and at start/end points traversed by protesters
might suppress vehicle ramming incidents.

Public safety offices require advanced notification to deploy traffic spikes
given a march route and duration estimate. Protest planning forbearance
reduces flash-mob spontaneity, but can enhance pedestrian safety that
appears absent today.

https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/06/chrome-extensions-with-33-million-downloads-slurped-sensitive-user-data/

The extensions, which Google removed only after being privately notified of
them, actively siphoned data such as screenshots, contents in device
clipboards, browser cookies used to log in to websites, and keystrokes such
as passwords, researchers from security firm Awake told me. Many of the
extensions were modular, meaning once installed, they updated themselves
with executable files, which in many cases were specific to the operating
system they ran on. Awake provided additional details in this report.

Subject: This sneaky malware goes to unusual lengths to cover its tracks
  (ZDNet)

*Glupteba creates a backdoor into infected Windows systems - and researchers
think it'll be offered to cyber criminals as an easy means of distributing
other malware.*

A malware campaign which creates a backdoor providing full access to
compromised Windows PC, while adding them to a growing botnet, has developed
some unusual measures for staying undetected.

Glupteba first emerged in 2018 and started by gradually dropping more
components into place on infected machines in its bid to create a backdoor
to the system.

The malware is continuously in development and in the last few months it
appears to have been upgraded with new techniques and tactics to coincide
with a new campaign which has been detailed by cybersecurity researchers at
Sophos.
<https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-malware-everything-you-need-to-know-about-viruses-trojans-and-malicious-software/>

The paper <https://news.sophos.com/en-us/?p=67447> describes Glupteba as
"highly self-defending malware" with the cyber criminal group behind it
paying special attention to "enhancing features that enable the malware to
evade detection".

However, its method of distribution is relatively simple: it's bundled in
pirated software, including cracked versions of commercial applications, as
well as illegal video game downloads. The idea is simply to get as many
users to download compromised applications which contain the Glupteba
payload as possible.

To ensure the best possible chance of a successful compromise, the malware
is gradually dropped, bit-by-bit onto the system to avoid detection by any
anti-virus software the user may have installed. The malware also uses the
EternalBlue SMB vulnerability to help it secretly spread across networks.
<https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-the-fixed-windows-eternalblue-exploit-wont-die/>

But that isn't where the concealment and self-defence ends, because even
after installation Glupteba goes out of its way to stay undetected. [...]

Subject: Masked arsonist might've gotten away with it if she hadn't left
  Etsy review (Jon Brodkin)

Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica, 18 Jun 2020
Woman who burned two police cars IDed by tattoo and Etsy review of her
T-shirt.

  To some extent, every Internet user leaves a digital trail. So when a
  masked arsonist was seen on video setting fire to a police car on the day
  of a recent protest in Philadelphia, the fact that her face was hidden
  didn't prevent a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent from tracking down
  the suspect. The keys ended up being a tattoo and an Etsy review the
  alleged arsonist had left for a T-shirt she was wearing at the scene of
  the crime, according to the FBI.

Subject: The Pentagon's Bottomless Money Pit (RollingStone)

When the Defense Department flunked its first-ever fiscal review, one of our
government's greatest mysteries was exposed: Where does the DoD's $700
billion annual budget go?

Contains numerous mentions of huge IT project failures.

https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/pentagon-budget-myst

Just over 50 years ago, Dwight Eisenhower gave his famous farewell address
warning of the power of the "military-industrial complex." The former war
commander bemoaned the creation of a "permanent armaments industry of vast
proportions," and said the "potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced
power exists and will persist."

Eisenhower's warning is celebrated by the left as a caution against the
overweening political power of war-makers, but as we're now seeing, it was
predictive also as a fiscal conservative's nightmare vision of the future.
The military has become an unstoppable mechanism for hoovering up taxpayer
dollars and deploying them in the most inefficient manner possible.

Subject: Testing, testing, testing

Recently, a certain national leader has directed that testing for the
SARS-CoV-2 virus be "slowed" so that the numbers of new cases of the disease
will be reduced.  This is, of course, flatly ridiculous.  Testing does not
cause problems, it just reveals existing problems.  And the lack of testing
doesn't prevent problems, it only blinds you to the scope of the problem.  I
have told my "testing" story before ...

Oh, well, what the hey:

I am reminded of a situation where sales and marketing was supposed to carry
out virus scans before they installed our product. They had previously been
using an inferior product, and I mandated that they using a more accurate
product.  At one point a machine was brought in as a problem. First step in
my process was to scan the machine, and, sure enough, it was infected.

"Did you scan it?"

"Yes."

"Did you use the right scanner?"

"Well, no, we used the old one."

"Why did you use the old scanner, when I've specified that you have to use
the new one?"

"Well, when we use the one you told us to, it finds viruses ..."

I agree this is pretty creepy, but how is this fundamentally different from
the way that EU laws like right to be forgotten make search engines results
in Europe omit stuff that is included other places?

If you're going to operate in a country at all, you have to follow the
country's rules. I expect I would have a different answer to whether I'd
operate in China.
