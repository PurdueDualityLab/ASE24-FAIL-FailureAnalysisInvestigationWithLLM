Subject: Train brake failure; broken valve

<http://www.raib.gov.uk/publications/bulletins/bulletins_2009/bulletin_03_2009.cfm>

During a switching movement at a siding, a locomotive's automatic brake
valve handle suddenly has no effect. Engineer applied independent brakes,
but they can't stop the train due to its weight.

[Broken valve roll pin]

Releasing the deadman pedal was no help because the brake system was
designed to ignore it if the locomotive brake cylinders had at least 30
PSI. There was no other means in the cab to exhaust the train line.

Risks? First, not having a second, independent emergency valve. Second,
the override on the deadman almost lead to dead men.....

MetaRISK? How long have we been making trains with Westinghouse air brakes,
and we still have not found all possible critical failures?

How will we ever do so for complex systems?

Subject: Collision - UK and French Nuclear subs

The report is at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7892294.stm

Quote "*A Royal Navy nuclear submarine was involved in a collision with a
French nuclear sub in the middle of the Atlantic, the MoD has confirmed.*"

What is interesting is the potential causes of this incident.

The British published point of view is that it is a random accident caused
by two extremely stealthy submarines accidentally colliding.

May I suggest two alternative hypotheses?

First: The collision was a result of one of the submarines stalking the
other, and as an unexpected outcome, colliding with the target?

Second: Perhaps current submarine navigation systems constrain the vessels
to travel at specific, and integral, depths and tracks?

The second hypothesis has an all too real correspondent in the present air
navigation systems. The precision of current air navigation systems means
that aircraft fly within metres of expected altitude and track. The result
of such precision is an increased risk of collision in case of accidental
assignment to conflicting air routes. A case in point is the collision on
September 26, 2006 over Brazil.

Subject: Control-Alt-Eject? French Navy grounded...

[Source: UPI, 7 Feb 2009]

A computer virus infected French military databases and grounded some navy
fighter jets for two days last month, a navy spokesman says.  Naval
spokesman Jerome Erulin said the recent computer security breach was limited
but prevented the aircraft from downloading flight plans, The Daily
Telegraph reported Saturday.  "It affected exchanges of information but no
information was lost. It was a security problem we had already simulated,"
Erulin said. "We cut the communication links that could have transmitted the
virus and 99 percent of the network is safe."

The database infection by "Conficker," a malicious software virus publicly
reported by Microsoft last October, likely was the result of negligence,
naval officials said.  *The Telegraph* said, according to a report by French
newspaper *Liberation*, the infection involved France's Villacoublay air
base and the 8th Transmissions Regiment and left fighter jets grounded for
two days starting Jan. 15.

Subject: GCTIP: New Forums for Internet Transparency, Performance, ISP Issues

            Announcing GCTIP - New Forums for Internet Transparency, 
                         Performance, and ISP Issues
                 http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000506.html

Greetings.  I'm pleased to announce the availability of a new venue for
discussion, reporting, analysis, information sharing, queries, and consumer
assistance regarding Internet performance, transparency, and measurement,
plus a wide range of topics associated with consumers and their interactions
with Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

Called GCTIP Forums:
     http://forums.gctip.org
this project -- The "Global Coalition for Transparent Internet Performance"
-- is the outgrowth of a network measurement workshop meeting sponsored by
Vint Cerf and Google at their headquarters in June, 2008 for a number of
academic network measurement researchers and other related parties.  This is
the same meeting that formed the genesis of the open platform M-Lab
("Measurement Lab") project that was recently announced (
http://www.measurementlab.net ).

GCTIP was the original name for the mailing list that I maintained for that
Google meeting and subsequent discussions (full disclosure: I helped to
organize the agenda for the meeting and also attended).

Unless we know what the performance of the Internet for any given users
really is -- true bandwidth performance, traffic management, port blocking,
server prohibitions, Terms of Service concerns, and a wide range of other
parameters, it's impossible for anyone who uses Internet services to really
know if they're getting what they're paying for, if their data is being
handled appropriately in terms of privacy and security, and all manner of
other crucial related issues.

While transparency and related concerns do have impacts on "network
neutrality" issues, neither GCTIP nor GCTIP Forums are oriented toward
network neutrality discussions.

The purpose of GCTIP Forums is to provide a free discussion environment to
act as a clearinghouse for all stakeholders (technical, consumers, ISPs,
government-related, etc.) to interact on the range of "network transparency"
and associated topics.  The focus is on collecting, analyzing, and
disseminating reports relating to Internet measurement/test data -- plus
associated concerns, discussions, etc., in manners that are most useful to
the network community at large.  There are many groups working in the
network measurement area, but surprisingly little data sharing,
coordination, or ongoing reporting in a form that is useful to most ordinary
Internet consumers or other interested observers.

An area of particular concern is helping to assure that measurement tests
and perceived consumer problems with their ISPs aren't misinterpreted by
users resulting in unfair or simply wrong accusations against those ISPs.  I
feel strongly that consumers need a place to go with these sorts of issues
where the broader community and experts can help interpret what's really
going on.  Guilty firms should be exposed, but the innocent must not be
inappropriately branded.

All current GCTIP Forums topics can be viewed without signing up on the
system.  Simple registration is required to post new discussion threads and
replies, but no non-administrative topics are currently pre-moderated (any
reported materials confirmed to be inappropriate will be deleted promptly).

GCTIP Forums exist to enable the exchange of relevant ideas, queries, data,
and other information for anyone concerned about the Internet worldwide.

The Forums are seeded with five top-level discussion topics to get things
rolling, but suggestions for additional categories are welcome.  New threads
(e.g. discussions of particular measurement tools, measurement results,
specific ISP issues and concerns, etc.) can be created by registered users,
starting right now.

Please note that I am running GCTIP on my own dime at this point.  At such a
time as any outside support funding becomes available for the project (which
would be very much appreciated!) it will be publicly announced of course.

Spread the word!  This is your chance to help yourself and everyone else
better understand what the Internet is *really* doing, and by extension,
where it is going tomorrow.

Thanks very much.  Be seeing you ... at: http://forums.gctip.org ...

Subject: The mystery of `Ireland's worst driver': an HR/training problem

This seems to me that this is an HR and training problem.  True -- it
involves a computer database -- but the database is not at fault.  As a
preventative measure you would probably want to have "Driver's Licence" in
as many different languages in said same offence database, but tagged to
indicate as such just in case some untrained person makes a mistake.

Ultimately, in Greater Europe (from Vladivostok to Iceland to Saint Helena)
the traffic-oriented part of the police forces must be trained in knowing
all the variants of driver's permits in their region.

Countries that need to check their own national driving offence databases
for this problem: Southern Hemisphere: Australia, NZ & Fiji.
North America: US, Canada & Mexico.

Max Power  http://HireMe.geek.nz/ 

The mystery of Ireland's worst driver 

Details of how police in the Irish Republic finally caught up with the
country's most reckless driver have emerged, the Irish Times reports.

He had been wanted from counties Cork to Cavan after racking up scores of
speeding tickets and parking fines.

However, each time the serial offender was stopped he managed to evade
justice by giving a different address. 

But then his cover was blown. 

It was discovered that the man every member of the Irish police's rank and
file had been looking for - a Mr Prawo Jazdy - wasn't exactly the sort of
prized villain whose apprehension leads to an officer winning an award.

In fact he wasn't even human. 

"Prawo Jazdy is actually the Polish for driving licence and not the first
and surname on the licence," read a letter from June 2007 from an officer
working within the Garda's traffic division.  "Having noticed this, I
decided to check and see how many times officers have made this mistake.
"It is quite embarrassing to see that the system has created Prawo Jazdy as
a person with over 50 identities."  The officer added that the "mistake"
needed to be rectified immediately and asked that a memo be circulated
throughout the force.

In a bid to avoid similar mistakes being made in future relevant guidelines
were also amended.  And if nothing else is learnt from this driving-related
debacle, Irish police officers should now know at least two words of Polish.
As for the seemingly elusive Mr Prawo Jazdy, he has presumably become a cult
hero among Ireland's largest immigrant population.

Subject: Hiding in plain sight

I recently started working on a project that has a * in the middle of its
name - think of GM's On*Star as an example.  Google (and other search
engines I tried, including Microsoft Live, Yahoo!, and Lycos) all treat the
* as a wildcard, and don't allow wildcard escaping.

Now On*Star isn't hard to find with Google, because the words "on" and
"star" rarely appear together except in this context.  But if you take two
other words that frequently occur together, put a * between them, and then
try to find references to that unique term, you won't get very far.  For
example, stimulus*package would not be a good name, nor would high*tech.

It's not clear to me whether the people who started this project knew that
their project name would make it effectively impossible to find the project
and either did that intentionally or didn't care, or whether it's a
happenstance that is now a problem.  But in any case, it's a way to hide in
plain sight - any websites they have can be indexed by robots, but won't be
found by searchers.

The risk is the interaction between name selection and search engine
operation.  If someone deliberately picks a name this way, and then the
search engines change their behavior, the value (anonymity) instantly
disappears.  The classic security problem of a distributed system with
uncoordinated security policies....

It's one thing when banks and universities screw up by not encrypting their
hard drives, but an unencrypted drive in a military laptop ostensibly filled
with sensitive information in a war-zone has to win first place in the
f**k-up olympics.

"A good price means $800, he says. This would be a steep price in the
secondhand market for a regular Intel Pentium M laptop manufactured in
2004. But this is not ordinary equipment... The computer also contained
dozens of manuals on how to operate, assemble and trouble shoot U.S. Army
equipment - everything from "space heaters" to "up-armored humvees." Some of
the manuals contain restricted information and warn that "distribution is
limited to U.S. government agencies," with instructions to "destroy by any
methods that must prevent disclosure of contents or reconstruction of the
document." But the machine - and all the information inside - was available
for a price in the open market in Peshawar. And it makes an attractive
investment for anyone who has in their possession any form of serious
U.S. military hardware."

laptop. OTOH, maybe it's a honey-laptop? filled with tracking software and

Subject: Risks of reading RISKS

Re: 390,000 to access child database (RISKS-25.55)

One of the risks of reading RISKS is that one may be tempted to believe that
articles described as "Full story at:" do actually contain the full story.

For example, hands up how many of you read "390,000 to access child database
... of all under 18 year-olds in England" and assumed that this means all
390k have full access to the whole database?

It would help if those submitting risks items actually state what they think
the risk is, so that their concerns can be allayed should they be misplaced.

Subject: When a bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing

As has been widely reported (but for whatever reason not in RISKS that I can
find), the ability to find MD5 collisions has been used to create
counterfeit intermediate certificates, thus putting users at risk of
trusting incorrect sites.  More detail at
http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/ and hundreds of news reports, such
as Markoff's blog (*The NY Times) at
http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/30/outdated-security-software-threatens-web-commerce/?pagemode=print

I got an e-mail recently from a colleague who is not a security specialist,
but is a specialist in designing power plants.  He read the news coverage,
interpreted it as "SSL is no longer secure", and decided to roll his own
security protocol for use in a new power plant where he's designing the
control systems.  My reaction, of course, was "NO! don't do that", but I
wonder how many other people out there have drawn the same conclusion, and
don't have a security expert to turn to for advice.

The risk?  In finding security problems, we need to carefully communicate
not only the problem, but also what people should do in response, lest the
cure be worse than the disease.  I think the researchers did a good job of
that -- explaining that use of SHA-1 hashes in certificates are much better
than MD5, and eventually moving to SHA-2 or something else in the
certificates is the long term solution -- but that level of detail got lost
in much of the popular reporting.

Subject: Re: Hoare on Null References (Schaefer, RISKS-25.55)

Rpbert Schaeffer's assertions in Risks-25.55 concerning what I take to be
Goedel's Theorem are misleading. And I am not persuaded by a corrected
version of his argument, either.

Schaeffer asserts: "You can't prove that a system is both correct and
complete without going outside that system."  So, to begin with, let's get a
more accurate expression of what Schaeffer might want to say. He doesn't
explain what "correct" means in his statement. Let me assume he means
"consistent" in its classical sense.

First, given a theory L in first-order logic, you can, contrary to
Schaeffer, indeed prove in L that L is both consistent and complete,
provided that L has the resources to express those statements, if L is
inconsistent. Indeed, you can prove anything in L that L can express.

Second, a partial reverse: given a theory L in first-order logic that
contains Peano arithmetic (indeed, it doesn't need to be full Peano
arithmetic - an substantial fragment will suffice), one can prove
completeness of L in L only if L is inconsistent.

The conditions that Schaeffer missed was that L must be a consistent
classical first-order theory containing an appropriately substantial
fragment of Peano arithmetic. Then you can say that L cannot prove its own
completeness.

Now, consider these conditions one by one. One may think that inconsistent
theories are not useful. One may also think that all useful theories must be
formulated in, or contain, classical first-order logic. One may also think
that all useful theories contain Peano arithmetic. All these conditions may
be questioned when dealing with computer systems of any sort, as follows.

The people who study and develop paraconsistent logics would disagree that
inconsistent theories are not useful. Paraconsistent logics are classically
inconsistent.  There are obvious ways to weaken first-order logics to allow
some statements of the form (A & not-A) to be proved, but not all. And even
if one retains classical inference, if one uses L for reasoning (rather than
for illustrating purely mathematical points) then for practical purposes one
might only be interested in things one can deduce in L through proofs of
bounded length (there is a limit to what we can achieve in the life of the
universe), say length B. If the shortest proof of a statement of the form (A
and not-A) is longer than B, then for one's purposes the inconsistency of L
might not be relevant.

Finally, it is questionable that Goedel's theorem could apply here at all. I
don't know any computer languages or compilers, and certainly no physical
machines, that implement Peano arithmetic, or indeed a sufficiently
substantial fragment. All computer arithmetic I know is finite, and I
confidently expect it to stay that way.

Subject: Re: Tony Hoare: "Null References" (Diamond, RISKS-25.55)

There was an even earlier language, Pascal, that provided all that security,
and more.  It had simultaneous advantages and disadvantages over C:

Pascal was complete.  You didn't need a large standard library.  It was
defined.  This was both an advantage and a disadvantage, since you could
immediately write your software, but the language couldn't evolve as easily
as could C.

The act of having run-time checks, and many compile-time checks, allowed the
checking code to be fairly trivial.  Good systems could expect about a 5%
effect.  In comparison equivalent C checking was (and is) virtually
impossible, or requires exorbitant run-time support.  The same things that
create C advantages (e.g. string storage that can be a great variable) cause
horrible checking problems.

Pascal had an approved ISO standard about 10 years before C.

Pascal suffered greatly from the Borland disease.  Borland implemented a
form of Pascal that did not meet the standards, and still doesn't.  That
meant that programmers never learned the appropriate ways to write code,
especially interactive code.

Pascal had the great advantage of defined i/o systems (files, etc.)  which
were extremely flexible.  However the limitations of some of the standard
procedures affected things.  For example, there was no way to
programatically control the error response on a "read(integer);" call.

Subject: Re: Tony Hoare: "Null References" (Diamond, RISKS-25.55)

The inventors of the C language did not merely omit array bounds checking
from C; they encouraged C programmers to omit manual bounds checking as
well. This is what really bothers me.  Consider:

1. Early C programming books suggested the idiom
	while (*p++ = *q++);
   to copy a string from one area to another. No bounds checking was ever
   suggested.

2. The C library contained several functions that ignored array bounds,
including the infamous "gets" function, which read an input line into a
buffer - and took no length parameter for the buffer.  It was impossible to
use gets safely; no matter what buffer you provide, there was a potential
input line long enough to cause a buffer overflow.

3. When you pass an array as a parameter, its size is lost to the called
function.  As with Fortran, if you care about buffer size, you must pass it
as an additional parameter - a sizable (so to speak) nuisance.

Omitting array bounds checking may have made sense at the time given the
available hardware and compiler technology.  But there was no need to create
"gets" without a size parameter, or to avoid passing array sizes by default.
(Cases where it would have been too inefficient to push the array size
parameter onto the stack could have been handled by distinguishing between
arrays and pointers.)
