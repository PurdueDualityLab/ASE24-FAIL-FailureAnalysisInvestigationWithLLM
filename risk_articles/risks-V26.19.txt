Subject: "Missile Mishap Revives Alarm Over Nuclear Arsenal"

27 Oct 2010 -- Computer glitches, hardware failures and unexplained
communication outages happen all the time. But when the affected systems
control nuclear-armed missiles, it gets a little scary.

That's why Saturday's brief malfunction at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in
Wyoming, disconnecting 50 intercontinental ballistic missiles of the
450-ICBM-strong U.S. arsenal from their human controllers, has raised
concerns just two years after a Defense Department panel said there had been
"an atrophy of the Air Force's nuclear mission."

"It is yet another indication of the risk associated with having these types
of weapons around," said Stephen Young, a senior analyst at the Union of
Concerned Scientists, which advocates a reduction in the atomic arsenals of
the U.S. and other nuclear-armed states.

A Cell-Phone Network without a License
A trial system offers calling, texting, and data by weaving signals around
the chatter of baby monitors and cordless phones.

By Tom Simonite
<http://www.technologyreview.com/communications/26581/?p1=A4>

A trial cell-phone network in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, gets by without
something every other wireless carrier needs: its own chunk of the
airwaves. Instead, xG Technology, which made the network, uses base stations
and handsets of its own design that steer signals through the unrestricted
900-megahertz band used by cordless phones and other short-range devices.

It's a technique called "cognitive" radio, and it has the potential to make
efficient use of an increasingly limited resource: the wireless spectrum. By
demonstrating the first cellular network that uses the technique, xG hopes
to show that it could help wireless carriers facing growing demand but a
relatively fixed supply of spectrum.

Its cognitive radios are built into both the base stations of the trial
network, dubbed xMax, and handsets made for it. Every radio scans for clear
spectrum 33 times a second. If another signal is detected, the handset and
base station retune to avoid the other signal, keeping the connection
alive. Each of the six base stations in xG's network can serve devices in a
2.5-mile radius, comparable to an average cell-phone tower.

"In Fort Lauderdale, our network covers an urban area with around 110,000
people, and so we're seeing wireless security cameras, baby monitors, and
cordless phones all using that band," says Rick Rotondo, a vice president
with xG, which is headquartered in Sarasota, Florida. "Because our radios
are so agile, though, we can deliver the experience of a licensed cellular
network in that unlicensed band."

Subject: Medical errors in Colorado

   [Thanks to dkross]

Unthinkable errors by doctors and surgeons -- such as amputating the wrong
leg or removing organs from the wrong patient -- occur more frequently than
previously believed, a new study suggests.  Over a period of 6.5 years,
doctors in Colorado alone operated on the wrong patient at least 25 times
and on the wrong part of the body in another 107 patients, according to the
study, which appears in the Archives of Surgery.

So-called wrong-patient and wrong-site procedures accounted for about 0.5
percent of all medical mistakes analyzed in the study. Although these
serious errors are rare overall, the numbers seen in the study are
"considerably higher" than previous estimates, researchers say.

Subject: A jail risk of 2^31 in Colorado

Summary: A server reaches a limit of 2^31 records and real-time alerts
ceased for a number of persons being electronically monitored in lieu of
jail

"Boulder County Jail officials are planning to meet next week with a
Boulder-based company that provides GPS, alcohol and electronic monitoring
for offenders at about 900 correctional agencies nationwide after it left
thousands of people unsupervised during a technical failure this week."  "BI
Inc., 6400 Lookout Road, experienced a problem with one of its offender
monitoring servers at 7:29 a.m. Tuesday, temporarily disabling the server's
notification system and delaying violation notifications to customers,
according to BI spokeswoman Monica Hook.  The problem was fixed about 12
hours later, according to Hook, and the BI staff notified customers within
minutes of discovering the issue. The monitoring system continued to operate
and gather information while it was down, but the transmissions were delayed
until the system was restored, according to Hook. All offender activity
logged while the server was down still was processed, and alerts that might
have occurred during that time were sent to the agencies when the system was
back up, Hook said."

"The technical glitch happened when one of BI's servers exceeded its
threshold of 2.1 billion records, according to company officials. The
problem is now resolved, and BI has expanded its database threshold to more
than 1 trillion records. The company also is developing a warning system
that will alert BI in the future if it nears the limit, said Patrick Hyde, a
BI spokesman. The offenders and suspects on the BI monitoring system did not
know their devices were down at the time, Hyde said, and there were no major
problems reported as a result of the technical failure."

Subject: Financial market automated amplification of trades

We've become accustomed to network attackers developing new attacks to
circumvent defenses.  Some of the really clever attacks use amplification -
figuring out how to use the system against itself, in a way that takes away
the need for the attacker to do so much work.  For example, if an attacker
can send a message to a server that causes the server to send out a thousand
messages, then the attacker can launch a Denial of Service attack more
simply.  (There was an attack of this sort at the network protocol level
some years ago, although I've forgotten the details.)

Now we're seeing that amplification approach in the financial space in
Norway, where two day traders figured out how to manipulate the markets in
such a way as to cause robot buyers/sellers to do the dirty work, that they
can then benefit from.  "The two men worked out how the computerized system
would react to certain trading patterns -- allowing them to influence the
price of low-volume stocks."  Although the article gives no indication of
how they did it, the day traders ``gave false and misleading signals about
supply, demand and prices'', which caused the robots to take action -- which
the day traders then took advantage of.

They've been convicted and given jail sentences and fines.

Of course the risk is that when you automate anything, you have to
consider how an adversary may take advantage of that automation!

Subject: Fear the baa of the Firesheep

Rob Coppinger, Mocking the social notworks. *The Inquirer*, 27 Oct 2010
http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1811527/fear-baa-firesheep

More Firesheep fun is to be had as one of its creators has blogged to say
that future versions are still to come.  The extension for Firefox that is
Firesheep caused a wave of Internet gibbering when it was released at the
weekend and shown to allow people to grab personal data from social
networking websites.  As of yesterday, over 120,000 people had downloaded
the app, and probably not for highly moral purposes, either.

Firesheep was created by Ian Gallagher, an IT worker in the insecurity
field, and his pal Eric Butler, a freelance web applications software
developer based in Seattle. They wanted to raise the issue of HTTP session
hijacking, which has been known to be a problem for at least six years, and
is the basis of how Firesheep works.  In a moment of understatement, not
something Americans are known for, Butler said on his blog on 26 Oct, "I
thought there might be moderate interest."

Butler goes on to criticise website owners for just encrypting the initial
use of the username and password and not the subsequent cookie that's
returned. To protect against the vulnerability that Firesheep exploits would
simply require websites to support full encryption everywhere. Alas, the big
beasts of the Internet jungle haven't been bothered.

To quote Butler, "These sites fail to protect you because after you've
authenticated, you're issued a cookie that identifies you throughout your
browsing session." He should have added, "these so called professionals that
make schoolboy errors".

Apparently pleased with his new-found fame and the widespread interest in
Firesheep, Butler said, "Keep an eye on this blog as well as my Twitter feed
for updates on these issues and other new features." We certainly will, with
slightly more than casual interest.

Subject: DC Internet voting trial

In RISKS-26.18, I summarized the results to date on the District of Columbia
Internet voting trial.  Here's an update:

Sometime during the week of 4 Oct 2010, the DC Board of Elections and Ethics
resumed the trial (I don't have accurate notes when).  On 8 Oct, there was a
hearing of a DC City Council committee, where Dr. Alex Halderman from the
University of Michigan revealed that in addition to playing the "fight
song", their team (made up of Dr. Halderman, two of his students, and one of
his colleagues from the IT department) had:

(1) Modified all ballots already cast in the mock election to select
write-in candidates such as HAL 9000 and other robots and computers.
(2) Modified the software so all future votes would also be cast for
their write-in candidates.
(3) Modified the software so they could see all future votes and who cast them.
(4) Obtained the (unencrypted) voter IDs and PINs (effectively
usernames and passwords) for all 900+ authorized voters (*).
(5) Gained control of the routing infrastructure (as a result of
default passwords being unchanged), so they could redirect or block
network traffic. (**)
(6) Gained access to security cameras in the BoEE which were not protected.

(*) These were the IDs for the real November 2010 election, not for
the mock election being tested.
(**) The Michigan team subsequently changed these passwords when they
found evidence of attacks from China and Iran also in progress.  They
did not suggest that this was a targeted attack against the election,
but rather general probing and manipulation of network infrastructure.

At the hearing, DC BoEE announced that the system would be used in the Nov
2010 election for distribution of blank ballots, but would not allow
submission of return ballots.  Ballots may be returned by postal mail,
email, or FAX.  (Of course all of these also have risks.)  BoEE also plans
to move forward with ballot return, although the timelines they gave were
unclear.

Not revealed at the hearing, but discussed in other contexts, Dr. David
Jefferson of Lawrence Livermore Labs and chair of VerifiedVoting.org
discovered that ballots submitted by Macintosh users were blank, but no
warning was given.  Subsequent to the trial period, the instructions for
voting were modified to recommend use of Adobe Acrobat (rather than other
PDF readers) for marking the ballot.

Opinion: The DC BoEE response says that "the toothpaste is out of the tube"
and Internet voting is an inevitability, and that the lesson "lesson learned
is not to be more timid, but more aggressive about solving the problem".
There's no reason to believe that fixing this set of problems is adequate -
in fact, we know from 40 years of experience in testing systems that
penetrate and patch doesn't work.  Simply wishing for better technology
isn't going to get us there, and using a real election as a testbed for
experimentation isn't the answer.  The problem isn't just the implementation
- in fact, I suspect that the quality of the software here was higher than
in most other Internet voting systems.  The problem is that Internet voting
is fundamentally broken (with the possible exception of end-to-end systems -
which have other problems) -- unlike e-banking, e-commerce, or
e-most-anything-else, there's no way for a voter to verify that her vote was
received and counted properly.  We can't count on pro bono teams like
Halderman's to come back and test future Internet election systems -- it's
time to put this idea aside for a decade and let science advance before
trying more experiments with real votes.

Subject: Washington D.C. Internet voting experiment risks (Sean Greene)

  [Please excuse some overlap with Jeremy's note.  PGN]

Sean Greene, D.C. hacking raises questions about future of online voting,
*Stateline* <http://www.stateline.org/live>, 22 Oct 2010
The Pew Center on the States <http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/>

For the upcoming election, Washington, D.C., was preparing to allow some
voters to send their ballots in over the Internet. It's a good thing
election officials tested the system first.
<http://www.dcboee.org/popup.asp?url=/pdf_files/nr_588.pdf>

Just two days after the District of Columbia Board of Elections and
Ethics opened the application for the public to experiment with this
fall, the system was hacked.
<http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/jhalderm/hacking-dc-internet-voting-pilot>

Unbeknownst to D.C. officials, a team of computer scientists from the
University of Michigan took control of the Web site, and changed the code to
make it play the school's fight song.
<http://www.cse.umich.edu/~jhalderm/pub/dc/thanks/>

The fight-song gag was the part of the hacking that elections officials
discovered themselves. More troubling is what they didn't notice.

That was revealed at a recent D.C. Council committee hearing, where J. Alex
Halderman, a University of Michigan professor who led the hacking effort in
order to demonstrate the system's security flaws, testified that his team
had in fact wrested complete control over the elections board's
server. Halderman produced 937 pages of names, addresses and PIN numbers of
test voters who had signed up to try out the system. Had it been a real
election, Halderman said, he could have changed the votes on ballots or
revealed voters' supposedly secret choices on the Internet.  Additionally,
Halderman's crew wasn't the only one rooting around in the D.C. system. They
noticed other attacks occurring, originating in China and Iran.

In response, the elections board decided to shelve the idea of having voters
submit ballots online. Eligible voters in the military and others living
overseas can still use the system to receive blank ballots, rather than
waiting for them in the mail. But they'll have to print the ballots out and
mail them back to Washington.

While the D.C. episode was a setback for voting over the Internet, elections
experts disagree on what it means for the future. Some say the District's
experience demonstrates what computer scientists have been saying for years
-- that the Internet in its current state cannot allow for secure online
voting. Others, including D.C.'s top elections official, still see potential
in online voting. In fact, the state of Arizona
<https://www.azsos.gov/election/military/default.aspx> and eight counties in
West Virginia aren't giving up plans to go ahead with their own online
voting experiments on 2 Nov 2010.

The video attached to this "voter problems" story actually contains
something more disturbing than the allegations in the story itself:
  http://www.fox5vegas.com/news/25511115/detail.html

To wit: the person in charge of the polls says that there is no problem with
the fact that the touch screen sensing a finger touching "English" accepts
that input and proceeds to the next screen (where the ballot is), and if the
person who just selected English hasn't removed their finger "quickly
enough", whatever candidates name was under the same section of screen is
instantaneously checked off, inadvertently.

Now this, IS a comp.risk !

Subject: Stuxnet

Computer security experts are often surprised at which stories get picked up
by the mainstream media. Sometimes it makes no sense. Why this particular
data breach, vulnerability, or worm and not others? Sometimes it's
obvious. In the case of Stuxnet, there's a great story.

As the story goes, the Stuxnet worm was designed and released by a
government--the U.S. and Israel are the most common suspects--specifically
to attack the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran. How could anyone not
report that? It combines computer attacks, nuclear power, spy agencies and a
country that's a pariah to much of the world. The only problem with the
story is that it's almost entirely speculation.

Here's what we do know: Stuxnet is an Internet worm that infects Windows
computers. It primarily spreads via USB sticks, which allows it to get into
computers and networks not normally connected to the Internet. Once inside a
network, it uses a variety of mechanisms to propagate to other machines
within that network and gain privilege once it has infected those
machines. These mechanisms include both known and patched vulnerabilities,
and four "zero-day exploits": vulnerabilities that were unknown and
unpatched when the worm was released. (All the infection vulnerabilities
have since been patched.)

Stuxnet doesn't actually do anything on those infected Windows computers,
because they're not the real target. What Stuxnet looks for is a particular
model of Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) made by Siemens (the press
often refers to these as SCADA systems, which is technically
incorrect). These are small embedded industrial control systems that run all
sorts of automated processes: on factory floors, in chemical plants, in oil
refineries, at pipelines--and, yes, in nuclear power plants. These PLCs are
often controlled by computers, and Stuxnet looks for Siemens SIMATIC
WinCC/Step 7 controller software.

If it doesn't find one, it does nothing. If it does, it infects it using yet
another unknown and unpatched vulnerability, this one in the controller
software. Then it reads and changes particular bits of data in the
controlled PLCs. It's impossible to predict the effects of this without
knowing what the PLC is doing and how it is programmed, and that programming
can be unique based on the application. But the changes are very specific,
leading many to believe that Stuxnet is targeting a specific PLC, or a
specific group of PLCs, performing a specific function in a specific
location--and that Stuxnet's authors knew exactly what they were targeting.

It's already infected more than 50,000 Windows computers, and Siemens has
reported 14 infected control systems, many in Germany. (These numbers were
certainly out of date as soon as I typed them.) We don't know of any
physical damage Stuxnet has caused, although there are rumors that it was
responsible for the failure of India's INSAT-4B satellite in July. We
believe that it did infect the Bushehr plant. [...]
