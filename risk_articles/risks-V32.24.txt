Subject: Cosmic rays may soon stymie quantum computing (phys.org)

https://phys.org/news/2020-08-cosmic-rays-stymie-quantum.html

Quantum computers are likely to require significant shielding to sustain
coherent qubit interactions while they compute solutions. Quantum computers
apply Josephson junctions to host qubit state. The junctions are sensitive
to perturbations at many wavelengths, including those arising from earth
tremor, thermal, x-ray, etc. How deep a basement, with tremor isolation,
ionization shields, etc. will be needed, is yet to be determined. This
experiment demonstrates qubit decoherence potential when high-energy photons
strike.

I am reminded of a similar issue affecting the "old" silicon-based
supercomputers: These massively parallel machines consist of separate
physical memory and cpu modules, each interconnected to each other via a
speedy message-passing network. See
https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/how-to-kill-a-supercomputer-dirty-power-cosmic-rays-and-bad-solder.

The memory modules are prone to cosmic ray intercept. The incident radiation
causes memory bit failures, often permanently disabling use.  Extended
computations (protein folding, nuclear weapon stockpile simulation, etc.)
crash, as does the machine, until triage can disable a row/column of
physical memory.

"In the summer of 2003, Virginia Tech researchers built a large
supercomputer out of 1,100 Apple Power Mac G5 computers. They called it Big
Mac. To their dismay, they found that the failure rate was so high it was
nearly impossible even to boot the whole system before it would crash.

"The problem was that the Power Mac G5 did not have error-correcting code
(ECC) memory, and cosmic ray-induced particles were changing so many values
in memory that out of the 1,100 Mac G5 computers, one was always crashing.
Unusable, Big Mac was broken apart into individual G5s, which were sold one
by one online. Virginia Tech replaced it with a supercomputer called System
X, which had ECC memory and ran fine."

Subject: Sendgrid Under Siege from Hacked Accounts

Email service provider *Sendgrid* is grappling with an unusually large
number of customer accounts whose passwords have been cracked, sold to
spammers, and abused for sending phishing and email malware attacks.
Sendgrid's parent company *Twilio* says it is working on a plan to require
multi-factor authentication for all of its customers, but that solution may
not come fast enough for organizations having trouble dealing with the
fallout in the meantime.

Many companies use Sendgrid to communicate with their customers via email,
or else pay marketing firms to do that on their behalf using Sendgrid's
systems. Sendgrid takes steps to validate that new customers are legitimate
businesses, and that emails sent through its platform carry the proper
digital signatures that other companies can use to validate that the
messages have been authorized by its customers.

But this also means when a Sendgrid customer account gets hacked and used to
send malware or phishing scams, the threat is particularly acute because a
large number of organizations allow email from Sendgrid's systems to sail
through their spam-filtering systems.

To make matters worse, links included in emails sent through Sendgrid are
obfuscated (mainly for tracking deliverability and other metrics), so it is
not immediately clear to recipients where on the Internet they will be taken
when they click.

Dealing with compromised customer accounts is a constant challenge for any
organization doing business online today, and certainly Sendgrid is not the
only email marketing platform dealing with this problem. But according to
multiple emails from readers, recent threads on several anti-spam discussion
lists <https://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=mailop%40mailop.org&q=sendgrid>
<https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SPAMASSASSIN/MailingLists>, and
interviews with people in the anti-spam community, over the past few months
there has been a marked increase in malicious, phishous and outright spammy
email being blasted out via Sendgrid's servers.  [...]

Subject: A bug in Windows 10 could be slowly wrecking your SSD (PC Gamer)

Fortunately a fix is on the way.

Microsoft is currently testing a fix for Windows 10 bug that could cause the
operating system to defragment solid state drives (SSDs) more often than is
needed. While periodic defragging of a mechanical hard disk drive (HDD) is a
good thing, doing it too often on SSDs can actually degrade their integrity
and shorten their lifespan.  [...]

As spotted by Bleeping Computer, when Microsoft rolled out the May 2020
update for Windows 10, it introduced a bug to the Optimize Drives feature
causing it to incorrectly determine the last time a drive has been
optimized. When you open it up, you might notice your SSD says "Needs
optimization" even if the routine was recently run (Windows 10 handles this
automatically).

Subject: Ambulance won't find mislocated addresses

Correct address placement on the map is how the ambulance can find your
house, in rural areas. (And no I'm not talking about G**gle Maps, I'm
talking about official (Taiwan) government e-maps.)

(Junior, a/k/a me, has taken it upon himself to be the unsung local hero,
saving many potential lives as usual, asking for justice for those
precarious misplaced address nodes scattered on the hills on the e-map on my
computer screen.)

So how are these addresses born? Well the applicant brings his stack of
property deeds to the Household Bureau office, and, well, we behind the desk
need to fill in a parcel number on the application form, so, well, just grab
one of the deeds and use that parcel number. Oh yes, visit the site and take
photographs for the records. So new address 35 is recorded as being located
on parcel 1234 instead of actual 1240...

Causing now twenty years later some addresses to be located in orchards or
on slopes hundreds of meters from where their respective actual houses
are. Yup, those parcel numbers are what we now used to place the address
nodes on the spanking new e-maps. Back in the old days some dusty number in
a ledger -- has now become a two-dimensional point on an e-map.

"That's the parcel number they applied with. They need to bring in their
documents to the office if they want to change the location."

Problem is, to the homeowner, there is nothing wrong with their address,
happily attached to their house. And indeed, let's say they are highly
literate (and still alive.) Well they still often won't be able to tell you
which of their stack of title deeds is the one referring to their house's
land vs. the one referring to their orchard.

Also who is going to tell lots of average citizens they need to march down
to the Household Bureau to correct some internal coordinate problem on some
obscure e-map? "Didn't your office take enough photos of my house back when
I applied already?"

Anyway, my suggestion to the Household Bureau is to simply connect to the
Land Bureau's computer and see if (thankfully usually still after all those
years) the parcel with the house belongs to the same person as the parcel
with the orchard, and update the records accordingly.

Or, just let it slide. And be blamed when the ambulance can't find somebody
in need.

And then there are those address nodes that ended up on nobody's land in the
middle of the creek...

https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200826-how-algorithms-keep-workers-in-the-dark

"Giving self-learning algorithms the responsibility to make and execute
decisions affecting workers is called 'algorithmic management.' It carries a
host of risks in depersonalizing management systems and entrenching
pre-existing biases."

The essay cites an example of an algorithm at work:

"At Amazon's fulfillment centre in south-east Melbourne, they set the pace
for 'pickers', who have timers on their scanners showing how long they have
to find the next item. As soon as they scan that item, the timer resets for
the next. All at a 'not quite walking, not quite running' speed."

Reminiscent of "John Henry" (see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_(folklore)). Would the algorithm
increase the interval if a picker tripped or was injured during item
fulfillment?  How does/would it learn of these outcomes? Are there feedback
variables that account for injuries? At what frequency is the algorithm
adjusted to account for under-fulfillment or over-fulfillment? Does the
employee receive better or worse compensation?

That's assuming it isn't the car at fault - a light touch on the indicator
stalk will cause it to flash three times to indicate a lane change, but I
regularly approach a junction, indicate, and it might flash ONCE before
auto-canceling! If I'm concentrating on an unfamiliar junction and an
uncooperative sat-nav, I don't need the additional grief of an auto-cancel
mechanism that keeps killing the indicators. I know on many occasions,
driving in a roughly straight line, I've had to indicate four or five times
approaching the junction because the indicator just won't stay on!

Subject: Re: Driverless cars are coming soon followup (PH, RISKS-32.23)

In saying that: "It is not even possible to brake without brake lights
flaring ", Peter Houppermans ignores the potential to brake using only the
handbrake, which does not (in the vast majority of vehicles) cause the brake
light(s) to illuminate.

Whilst I happily argue that too many designers have taken the versatility of
modern materials to the point that form trumps function, I do feel that the
modern "growing" turn indicator light is more reliable at indicating the
intended direction, especially at night and given the greater brilliance of
other exterior lights.

The above assumes that drivers use their indicators in sufficient time;
however many seem to use them solely to remind themselves what they just
did, rather than to advise other drivers of their intentions.  When I did my
Class 1 driver training with Greater Manchester Police Driving School it was
impressed upon me that hand signals, indicators, brake lights and car
positioning were all about communicating one's intentions to other road
users.  Of course that assumes others actually pay sufficient attention,
which increasingly seems to be less the case than when I started driving.

As to the drivers of some cars not using indicators, it has been reported
that Audi and BMW dealers no longer stock replacement bulbs because of a
lack of demand.

Subject: Driverless cars are coming soon followup (RISKS-32.23)

Possibly one of the most trivial posting to RISKS for a while...  My problem
is that many cars have parking/tail/turn signal/back-up/rear fog lights
crammed into small light clusters, so if the driver brakes and signals at
the same time, which happens quite often, it can be difficult to see the
flashing signal light against the steady bright brake light.  Some buses
have LED lights which just show colourless white when off so there's little
contrast between off and on indications.  I haven't driven overseas very
much, but at least with the American system of a big red rear brake/signal
light at each side it's less ambiguous, though if only one side of the
vehicle is visible (e.g., in a line of traffic), then it's not immediately
obvious if the driver has tapped the brakes or has started signaling.
There's the same problem with 4-way emergency hazard flashers, as if (again)
the vehicle is only visible at one side, it's not clear if the hazard
flashers or turn signals are indicating.

Easy.  Three arguments:

1. Ever tried to sort a large volume of post *without* computers involved?

2. Voting (and associated untruths, fraud, manipulation, funding deprivation
   etc. etc.) has been a staple of RISKS for decades as it represents indeed
   a major RISK to any enterprise, people and country if not done correctly
   and democratically.

3. As someone who integrates risks from various areas, I naturally have an
   interest that goes beyond *my* chosen area of expertise, mostly because
   the most important component (the human) has this pesky habit of not
   sticking to one category either -- they're everywhere!  This shows the
   human component.

The benefit of the RISKS mailing list has been for many years that it brings
together professionals in all walks of life sharing experiences which may
not always fall inside the original defined purpose, but which have a
connection which may even be at best tangential.  It allows people to widen
their perspective.

The items in question show a SYSTEM (hey, look, another subject matter hit)
seeks to repair itself as the pesky humans involved still try to do the
right thing.  That's educational and instructive, hence another argument for
its inclusion.

For the record, one of the reasons I try to read every RISKS is exactly
because it has remained diverse.

I, for one, hope it remains that way.

Frankenskeeters?

Cheap shots are fun, but in this case the costs of doing nothing are
substantial.

The Aedes mosquitoes they are targeting are dangerous to people. They
spread yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and zika. While you may not be
familiar with these diseases, people all over the tropics are. The keys have
had outbreaks of dengue, which is always miserable and at its worst
crippling or fatal. A friend of mine who lives in central America had
chikungunya, one of the less serious ones, and it made him unable to work
for the better part of a year.  You don't want to know what yellow fever is
like.

At this point the mosquito treatment is to spray pesticides into breeding
areas. We know what the consequences of that are, killing other desirable
insects and polluting the shallow waters around the Keys.

The mosquitoes they'll be releasing are males (only females bite) that
produce offspring that die before they mature unless they have tetracycline
in their diet which in the wild they don't. They've been released in Brazil
and other places and knocked down Aedes populations by 95%.

While it certainly possible that there is some effect that nobody has
noticed yet, it's a lot more likely that they'll do what's expected, kill
mosquitoes and prevent disease without toxic pesticides.

Looking at the reports about local opposition, I don't see anything beyond
genetically engineered == scary == bad along with some garbled complaints
about the way the mosquitoes were created.

Seems like maybe The History Channel should start reruns of "Life Without

why we vanished, just the aftermath.

"Welcome to earth: Population: zero."

The show examines possible results of a year, five years, ten, twenty, a
hundred, and so on to as far away as 10,000 years from now. The buildings
turning into rust and crumbling, the refinery explosions, nuclear power
plant meltdowns. family pets trapped indoors, sometimes dying, domesticated
animals going extinct because they needed humans to breed them, and the
cities becoming jungle as grass and other fauna and flora overtake them.

In the end, the world will erase every trace of our existence. The show even
explores this by visiting abandoned cities and settlements after 20 to 50
years, and the process of decomposing is already well along.

Willis Eschenbach, 3 Aug 2019
https://wattsupwiththat.wpcomstaging.com/2019/08/03/greenland-endures/

From that data, we find that the 1981 to 2010 thirty-year average mass
balance for the Greenland ice sheet was a net loss of 103 billion
tonnes. Again, this is a very large number, it seems like a big deal that
would demand our attention -- but is it really?

In order to ask the question ``How big is 103 billion tonnes?'', we have to
ask a related question:

Compared to what?

In this case, the answer is, ``Compared to the total amount of ice on
 Greenland''.

Here's one way of looking at that. We can ask, *if* Greenland were to continue
losing ice mass at a rate of 103 billion tonnes per year, how long would it
take to melt say half of the ice sheet? Not all of it, mind you, but half of
it. (Note that I am NOT saying that extending a current trend is a way to
estimate the future evolution of the ice sheet -- I'm merely using it as a
way to compare large numbers.)

To answer our question if 103 billion tonnes lost per year is a big number,
we have to compare the annual ice mass loss to the amount of ice

in the Greenland ice sheet. The Greenland ice sheet contains about
2.6E+15 (2,600,000,000,000,000) tonnes of water in the form of snow and
ice.

So *if* the Greenland ice sheet were to lose 103 billion tonnes per year
into the indefinite future, it would take about twelve thousand five hundred
years to lose half of it.

In other terms, the Ice Cap is losing  3.96**-5 of its mass every year,
or .00396% per year. Scary number, that is.

The effects of this are best shown graphically: Greenland Mass Balance and
Greenland Total Mass. It is the latter which is the reality. See attached.

Irreversible?  No.  In fact, the sign of the change changes. As recently as
3,500 BP the Greenland Ice Cap was much smaller than at present.

The version suggested by Terje Mathisen (RISKS-32.23) is one that I have
used.

I started working at a monitoring site many years ago that had a program
that needed to do some data logging once per minute (on the minute). The
programming environment did not have a function to return date and time, so
data and time needed to be obtained independently. The
logic in the program was:

 1. Ask for date, save year.
 2. Ask for date, save month.
 3. Ask for date, save day.
 4. Ask for time, save hour
 5. Ask for time, save minute.
 6. If minute has changed since last time through loop, do your stuff.
 7. Remember minute for next pass through loop
 8. Loop.

Yes, they really did do multiple DATE and TIME calls. Probably easier
(lazier?) to program year(now), month(now), day(now) than to create another
variable to store (now) and do year, month and day on the stored value.

Someone may have thought "the time it takes to get the date and time is so
small the chances of them not matching can be ignored." They were wrong (or
never even thought about it.) Yes, in any trip through the loop,. the
chances are small, but in most trips through the loop, the minute isn't
going to change and nothing is done. The only loop that triggers action is
the small fraction of loops where the minute DOES change. When the minute
has changed, it could have happened any time between steps 1 to 5 or going
from step 5 back to 1, and the probability of any one of those five
intervals is probably about equal.

So, the chances that the minute changed between requesting the hour and
requesting the minute is about 20%. And because you are doing things every
minute of the day, and every hour has a minute 59, there is a 20% chance
that at the end of the hour the routine is going to mess up. And you could
see that in the data it requested. four or five times a day, you saw a
sequence like this:

  * request data for 11:57
  * request data for 11:58
  * request data for 11:59
  * request data for 11:00
  * request data for 12:01

The replacement was as Terje suggested:

 1. ask for date, save year, month, and day
 2. ask for time, save hour and minute
 3. ask for date again. If day has changed, go back to 1.
 4. If minute has changed, do your stuff.
 5. Remember minute for next trip through loop
 6. Loop.

Step 3 avoids the date rollover. Using a single TIME call avoids the
hour roll-over.

I never saw a request for hour-old data again.

No matter how well made the dice are, as they are used they will collide with
each other and slowly (or quickly, depending upon the material) become more
and more deformed.  This means they will become less random, and each set of
dice will become less random in a different way.
