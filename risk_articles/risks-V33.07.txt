Subject: The radiation will never be higher in Chernobyl?  oops!

Radiation meters in the extended Chernobyl area have been reading higher and
higher, with many of them reporting numbers of 65500 nanosieverts/hr.

Which is annoyingly high, but likely (hopefully...)  simply a matter of
(formerly) stable contaminated dirt and dust getting kicked up from tanks
running over it and shelling, etc.

But ... this led to the following observation, which does add a bit more
concern:

[Twitter]

"An explanation for my non-IT followers is in order.

"Digital devices often store numerical values in data cells called a
"double" (two times 8 bits).

"The largest number it can store is (2 to the 16th, minus 1, which comes out
to) 65535... which rounded down to the nearest hundred is 65500..."

Subject: 3G shutdown will affect a host of everyday devices

The looming shutdown of 3G networks won't impact just older phones.

With AT&T's 3G network shutting down next week, and other carriers following
suit later this year, a range of products require updates to continue
working, including some home alarm systems, medical devices such as fall
detectors, and in-car crash notification and roadside assistance systems
such as General Motors' OnStar.

Just as many mobile carriers have urged customers to swap their older 3G
iPhones, Android phones, e-readers and other hand-held devices for newer
models ahead of the shutdown, other businesses are urging customers to
upgrade or replace some of the everyday products and services in their homes
and cars before they drop connectivity.

If left unaddressed, the stakes could be high in certain cases. Millions of
cars, for example, may no longer have the ability to contact first
responders after a collision or receive updates such as location or traffic
alerts for built-in GPS systems. Some vehicles, including Chevrolet, Buick
and Cadillac, have software upgrades for drivers to connect their systems to
a 4G network, but other models will reportedly lose this feature for good.

Subject: TurboTax Maker Intuit Faces Tens of Millions in Fees in a
 Groundbreaking Legal Battle Over Consumer Fraud (ProPublica)

At a hearing before U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer, a lawyer for
Intuit complained that â€œthe Keller firm is able to threaten companies
Intuit's not alone - into paying $3,000 in arbitration fees, for a $100
claim.

Breyer questioned whether the proposed settlement was in the best interest
of consumers.

Breyer: ``I did think when I looked at this, and saw that, really, that this
was a way to avoid or otherwise circumscribe arbitration, that it seemed to
be that Intuit was, in Hamlet's words, hoisted by their own petard, I think
arbitration is the petard that Intuit now faces.''  His comments were first
reported by Reuters.

Breyer rejected the settlement in March 2021.

 dangers involved (phys.org)

https://phys.org/news/2022-02-nasa-international-space-station-dangers.html

"The ISS has been described as the most expensive single item ever
constructed.[409] As of 2010, the total cost was US$150 billion. This
includes NASA's budget of $58.7 billion ($89.73 billion in 2021 dollars) for
the station from 1985 to 2015, Russia's $12 billion, Europe's $5 billion,
Japan's $5 billion, Canada's $2 billion, and the cost of 36 shuttle flights
to build the station, estimated at $1.4 billion each, or $50.4 billion in
total. Assuming 20,000 person-days of use from 2000 to 2015 by two-to
six-person crews, each person-day would cost $7.5 million, less than half
the inflation-adjusted $19.6 million ($5.5 million before inflation) per
person-day of Skylab." See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station#Cost, retrieved on
20FEB2022.

Assume construction and total operating costs aggregate to US$ 200B today.
Compare that lump sum to the ~US$ 1B per year (estimated in 2015) of revenue
generated from commercial spin-offs and license royalties.  See "Testimony

boxcar-sized return on investment cited to date, unless you count von Karman

There's some solid science on the ISS: The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer,
Bose-Einstein condensates, and some physiology experiments.

The ISS will be "dumped into the drink" sometime in 2031. Plenty of time to
plan how to dodge any de-orbited debris that misses the intended South
Pacific ocean graveyard burial.

Subject: Man versus machine: Human beings losing out as AI coldly fires
 under-performing workers (Straits Times)

https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/tech-news/man-versus-machine-human-beings-losing-out-as-ai-coldly-fires-under-performing-workers

  "We measure humans by the standards that are appropriate for machines and
  then we tell them we need technology to make them more human. It's
  perverse," said Professor Shannon Vallor, the Baillie Gifford Chair in the
  Ethics of Data and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh.

  Speaking at a recent panel discussion on AI, she said technology should be
  about enhancing people's capabilities and experiences. But, increasingly,
  she is seeing AI being designed to advance its performance, "and humans
  are being twisted into knots in order to make that possible".'

A business corrects processes when public outrage exposes AI deployments
that abuse employee capacities or cause physical harm.

Proactive monitoring of mechanized work, such as snap inspections of
highly-automated, AI-driven factories or warehouses will become impractical
as technological solutions penetrate deeper into manual labor.

Automated oversight of fair labor practices, as might be enforced by
regulations, is problematic in that whomever (or whatever) controls the
input regulatory specification determines compliance.

The automation of U.S. manufacturing robots replacing people on factory
floors is fueling rising mortality rate among America's working-age adults,
according to a new study by researchers at Yale and the University of
Pennsylvania.

Industrial automation accelerates labor dislocation while human despair
accumulates. How will highly industrialized societies sustain economy

To add to the long litany of outages reported in RISKS, my afternoon work

Subject: New Bill Would Bring Mobile Voting To WashDC (DCist)

As written, the bill would require that the Washington DC Board of Elections
create a secure system to allow any voter to fill out and submit a ballot
from their smartphone, tablet, or computer.  [...]

Still, the bill could face stiff opposition from experts who say that while
online security options are improving, mobile voting would still be
susceptible to hacking.

``There is currently no Internet technology available that allows for the
secure transmission of voted ballots while also maintaining voter privacy
and ballot verifiability,'' wrote Mark Lindeman, an expert on voting
security and audits with Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group that focuses
on elections and technology, in a recent letter to legislators in Rhode
Island considering a bill to allow ballots to be returned over the Internet.

Subject: SSL protocol mismatch

Lots of security tools are based on Linux, and the Linux environment tends
towards earlier adoption of updated security guidance.  This has created a
gap.  Kali Linux is intentionally configured to allow older protocols, but
has disabled SSLv3.

https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/openssl-configuration/

Windows as late as Windows 10 still has SSLv3 enabled.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/protocols-in-tls-ssl--schannel-ssp-#pre-tls-standard-protocols-support

It would be worthwhile to ensure your security tools have the older
protocols available for pen-testing.

Subject: Re: Really big electric power refund (Epstein, RISKS-33.06)

The ability to handle large numbers does not necessarily imply that those
numbers are expected to occur normally.For instance, it could have been a
prepackaged software routine that was general purpose enough to accommodate
conceivably huge amounts.

Common Lisp, for example, has the numeric-to-English-output feature built in
to the standard format function.I wrote code to implement this in the Lisp
system that I built for the IBM mainframe in the 1980s, so I know how it
would work.  Once you have established the algorithm to handle thousand,
million and billion, it is fairly straightforward to extend that to trillion
and up.  My code was written to handle amounts up to a vigintillion [?],
with little effort.

(It is said that 80% of the code of a given program is designed to handle
things that happen 20% of the time, or maybe 90%/10%.  Whatever.)

  [Whatever?  That seems irrelevant to RISKS.  It might just be the one line
  that is never expected to be executed that saves the day when it does get
  executed.  PGN]

Subject: Re: Really big electric power refund (BBC)

I am going to assume that someone just grabbed a library that may or may not
have had anything to do with money.

However, there's another risk here: just how big is a trillion?  If you
meant to write a check for "one trillion" in the 10^12 sense, it would be
rather awkward to do so in a jurisdiction where "one trillion" means 10^18.
Even in Zimbabwe that difference would have taken weeks to even out.

Subject: Re: Some Mazda cars stuck on a Seattle Station (RISKS-33.06)

In 2019 Github detailed a bug in the receivers; it's not clear if it is the
same bug or its brother. In either case, Little Johnny Tables
<https://xkcd.com/327/> came to mind.

<https://github.com/Hamled/mazda-format-string-bug#readme>

printf format string bug in Mazda Connect Infotainment System

Bug Description

The Infotainment System's UI (and possibly other software elements) crashes
when a Bluetooth audio source sends track metadata wherein the track name
(at least) includes a "%n" conversion specifier.

Example Case

When the track's title includes the string "99% Invisible" this triggers a
crash.  [...\

Perhaps the most unusual aspect of this from a coder's perspective (this
kind of bug isn't all that uncommon, unfortunately), is actually the 'I'
itself. This is a Microsoft-invented 'upgrade' to the ISO standard C format
specifiers, but it's almost certainly the case that Mazda's Infotainment
System does not use Windows as its operating system.

It turns out that GCC and Clang (the two major compilers for open source
software) have included the 'I' specifier as well, presumably for
compatibility so people can easily move their code from Microsoft's VC++
compiler to them (and back).

Talking about code using natural languages like English is really fraught
with problems! The Reply All episode that discussed this bug involved the
hosts speaking with some coders about using the phrase "percent I" -- but
maybe everyone was assuming "%i" which is much more common.

However for the computer, in its infinitely pedantic manner, "%i" and "%I"
have nothing in common... which means we as coders have to be aware of that
kind of difference. Without that key info, we wouldn't know to look past the
'I' and see that the 'n' is what was causing the crash.  ...
