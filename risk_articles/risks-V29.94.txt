Subject: Mars lander crash caused by 1-second inertial measurement error
  (European Space Agency)

The European Space Agency on 23 Nov 2016 said its Schiaparelli lander's
crash landing on Mars on 19 Oct 2016 followed an unexplained saturation of
its inertial measurement unit, which delivered bad data to the lander's
computer and forced a premature release of its parachute.

Polluted by the IMU data, the lander's computer apparently thought it had
either already landed or was just about to land. The parachute system was
released, the braking thrusters were fired only briefly and the on-ground
systems were activated.

Instead of being on the ground, Schiaparelli was still 3.7 kilometers above
the Mars surface. It crashed, but not before delivering what ESA officials
say is a wealth of data on entry into the Mars atmosphere, the functioning
and release of the heat shield and the deployment of the parachute -- all of
which went according to plan. [...]

*A one-second glitch and a 3,700-meter freefall*

In its Nov. 23 statement, ESA said the saturation reading from
Schiaparelli's inertial measurement unit lasted only a second, but was
enough to play havoc with the navigation system.

``[T]he erroneous information generated an estimated altitude that was
negative.  That is, below ground level. This in turn successively triggered
a premature release of the parachute and the back shell, a brief firing of
the braking thrusters and finally activation of the on-ground systems as if
Schiaparelli had already landed.  In reality, the vehicle was still at an
altitude of around 3.7 kilometers.''  ESA said the sequence of events ``has
been clearly reproduced in computer simulations of the control system's
response to the erroneous information.''

ESA's director of human spaceflight and robotic exploration, David Parker,
said in a statement that ExoMars teams are still sifting through the
voluminous data harvest from the Schiaparelli mission, and that an external,
independent board of inquiry, now being created, would release a final
report in early 2017.

 during election, experts say

  The flood of 'fake news' this election season got support from a
  sophisticated Russian propaganda campaign that created and spread
  misleading articles online with the goal of punishing Democrat Hillary
  Clinton, helping Republican Donald Trump and undermining faith in American
  democracy, say independent researchers who tracked the operation.
  Russia's increasingly sophisticated propaganda machinery -- including
  thousands of botnets, teams of paid human "trolls," and networks of Web
  sites and social-media accounts -- echoed and amplified right-wing sites
  across the Internet as they portrayed Clinton as a criminal hiding
  potentially fatal health problems and preparing to hand control of the
  nation to a shadowy cabal of global financiers. The effort also sought to
  heighten the appearance of international tensions and promote fear of
  looming hostilities with nuclear-armed Russia.  Two teams of independent
  researchers found that the Russians exploited American-made technology
  platforms to attack U.S.  democracy at a particularly vulnerable moment,
  as an insurgent candidate harnessed a wide range of grievances to claim
  the White House.  The sophistication of the Russian tactics may complicate
  efforts by Facebook and Google to crack down on *fake news*, as they have
  vowed to do after widespread complaints about the problem.

Subject: According to Snopes, Fake News Is Not the Problem

Jessi Hempel, BackChannel, 16 Nov 2016
Take it from the Internet's chief myth busters: The problem is the failing
media.
https://backchannel.com/according-to-snopes-fake-news-is-not-the-problem-4ca4852b1ff0

The day after the election, news began swirling around social media that
*New York Times* columnist David Brooks had called for President-elect
Donald Trump's assassination. Snopes managing editor Brooke Binkowski had a
feeling it was fake. Because, come on now, would a prominent columnist for a
reputable news outlet really make that kind of comment?

Snopes has made its business out of correcting the misunderstood satire,
malicious falsehoods, and poorly informed gossip that echoes across the
Internet -- and that business is booming. Traffic jumped 85 percent over the
past year to 13.6 million unique visitors in October, according to
comScore. The site supports itself through advertising, and in the last
three years it has made enough money to quadruple the size of its staff.

Sure enough, a bit of Snopes reporting revealed that Brooks had written a
column
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/opinion/the-view-from-trump-tower.html?_r=0>
saying Trump would likely resign or be impeached within a year. A news item
published on *The Rightists *claimed Brooks had then said in an interview
for KYRQ Radio New York that Trump should be killed. Snopes found *The
Rightists* doesn't even pretend to traffic in truth
<http://therightists.com/about-us/>. In the site's *about* section, it
describes itself this way: ``This is HYBRID site of news and satire.  part
[sic] of our stories already happens, part, not yet. NOT all of our stories
are true!'' What's more, the story's facts didn't add up. For example, the
site claimed Brooks had made the comments on a radio station KYRQ that
didn't exist.

Verdict: FALSE.
<http://www.snopes.com/david-brooks-trump-needs-to-decide-if-he-prefers-to-resign-be-impeached-or-get-assassinated/>

This is the state of truth on the Internet in 2016, now that it is as easy
for a Macedonian teenager to create a website as it is for *The New York
Times,* and now that the information most likely to find a large audience is
that which is most alarming, not most correct. In the wake of the election,
the spread of this kind of phony news on Facebook and other social media
platforms has come under fire for stoking fears and influencing the
election's outcome. Both Facebook and Google have taken moves to bar fake
news sites from their advertising platforms, aiming to cut off the sites'
sources of revenue.

A lawyer representing PM Benjamin Netanyahu sent a letter to an unemployed

It is still a mystery why this particular person was sued, and not the

  Trump online, and I didn't see any of the pro-Trump memes that were in

Subject: Miniature Wi-Fi Device Developed by Stanford Engineers Supplies
  Missing Link for the Internet of Things (Andrew Myers)

ACM TechNews; 23 Nov 2016

Andrew Myers, *Stanford News*, 16 Nov 2016

Stanford University researchers have developed HitchHike, a tiny,
ultra-low-energy wireless radio that enables data transmission using just
micro-watts of energy.  HitchHike "can be used as-is with existing Wi-Fi
without modification or additional equipment," and consumers can use it
today with a cell phone and an off-the-shelf Wi-Fi router, according to
Stanford researcher Pengyu Zheng.  HitchHike requires so little power a
small battery could drive it for a decade or more, and it has the potential
to harvest energy from existing radio waves and use that electromagnetic
energy to power itself, potentially indefinitely.  "HitchHike could lead to
widespread adoption in the Internet of Things," says Stanford professor
Sachin Katti.  HitchHike is a variation on a backscatter radio.  The system
bounces Wi-Fi signals back into the atmosphere, a signal known as
backscatter.  In order to function as a true radio, HitchHike must produce
its own messages, rather than reflect existing messages.  To do that, the
Stanford researchers developed "code word translation."  HitchHike shifts
its new signal to another Wi-Fi channel, thus avoiding the radio
interference between the original signal and the new data stream.
"HitchHike opens the doors for widespread deployment of low-power Wi-Fi
communication using widely available Wi-Fi infrastructure and, for the first
time, truly empower the Internet of Things," Zheng says.

Subject: India demonetization

India has a financial crisis, which they brought upon themselves, by poor
planning.  The economy is at a virtual stand still.

Certain currency is believed to be heavily used by criminals, and citizens
who fail to pay taxes, so India declared that two rupee notes, which had
been legal tender, would no longer be, and the people were given less than 2
months to get that currency converted to the replacement notes, at banks and
post offices.

Since India is a nation where 90% of the population do business by cash, and
85% of it in the rupee notes going away, there has been a stampede to where
they can convert their currency, with hundreds of people standing in line
for a day, all over the nation.

Some small businesses have gone out of business, because they cannot
function with the rupee notes which are still legal tender.

Since there is a ceiling on how much can be converted per person per day,
small businesses have each of their employees and family members doing their
dhare, magnifying how many people waiting in line, than would have been the
case without the daily limit.

Employees of many businesses have abandoned their work, because now they
must wait in line, day after day, to get their currency exchanged.

In the first week, at least 33 people died, because of the long lines, and
the shock.  One person, who needed to get to a hospital, died because a taxi
refused to accept the now banned currency.

ATM machines will take 2 weeks to be converted, having had no advance
warning, but in the mean time issue a much smaller note.

The nation is running out of some of the now legal types of currency,
including the replacement note.  Didn;t they have any idea how much was in
circulation?

There is no limit on how much of the currency, which will be illegal next
year, may be deposited into bank accounts, but then the people will have to
prove they paid taxes on that money, or else suffer severe tax penalties.

Subject: Bruce Schneier: 'The Internet era of fun and games is over'
  (Austin Powell)

   [We noted Bruce's testimony to the Congressional site in the previous
   issue of RISKS.  Here are some snippets.  PGN]

Austin Powell, Daily Dot, 16 Nov 2016
Speaking before members of Congress, the Internet pioneer made clear the
dangers of the Internet of Things.
<http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/bruce-schneier-internet-of-things/>

Internet pioneer Bruce Schneier issued a dire proclamation in front of the
House of Representatives' Energy & Commerce Committee Wednesday: ``It might
be that the Internet era of fun and games is over, because the Internet is
now dangerous.''

The meeting, which focused on the security vulnerabilities created by smart
devices, came in the wake of the Oct. 21 cyberattack on Dyn that knocked
Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, and other major web services offline.

Schneier's opening statement provided one of the clearest distillations of
the dangers posed by connected devices I've seen. It should be required
viewing. He starts around the 1:10:30 mark in the livestream below, but
we've also transcribed most of his remarks.

Here's how he framed the Internet of Things, or what he later called the
*world of dangerous things*:

  As the chairman pointed out, there are now computers in everything. But I
  want to suggest another way of thinking about it in that everything is now
  a computer: This is not a phone. It's a computer that makes phone calls. A
  refrigerator is a computer that keeps things cold. ATM machine is a
  computer with money inside. Your car is not a mechanical device with a
  computer. It's a computer with four wheels and an engine*.  This is the
  Internet of Things, and this is what caused the DDoS attack we're talking
  about.  He then outlined four truths he's learned from the world of
  computer security, which he said is *now everything security*.

1) Attack is easier than defense

Complexity is the worst enemy of security. Complex systems are hard to
secure for an hours' worth of reasons, and this is especially true for
computers and the Internet. The Internet is the most complex machine man has
ever built by a lot, and it's hard to secure. Attackers have the advantage.

2) There are new vulnerabilities in the interconnections

The more we connect things to each other, the more vulnerabilities in one
thing affect other things. We're talking about vulnerabilities in digital
video recorders and webcams that allowed hackers to take websites.  There
was one story of a vulnerability in an Amazon account [that] allowed hackers
to get to an Apple account, which allowed them to get to a Gmail account,
which allowed them to get to a Twitter account. Target corporation, remember
that attack? That was a vulnerability in their HVAC contractor that allowed
the attackers to get into Target. And vulnerabilities like this are hard to
fix. No one system might be at fault.  There might be two secure systems
that come together to create insecurity.

3) The Internet empowers attackers.

Attacks scale. The Internet is a massive tool for making things more
efficient. That's also true for attacking. The Internet allows attacks to
