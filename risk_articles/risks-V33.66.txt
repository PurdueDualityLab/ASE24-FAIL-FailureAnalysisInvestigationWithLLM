Subject: The EU's chat-control legislation is the most alarming proposal
 I've ever read (Matthew Green)

Taken in context, it is essentially a design for the most powerful text and
image-based mass surveillance system the free world has ever seen.

This legislation, which is initially targeted at child abuse applications,
creates the infrastructure to build in mandatory automated scanning tools
that will search for *known* media, *unknown* media matching certain
descriptions, and textual conversations.

The legislation is vague about how this will be accomplished, but the
*impact assessment* it cites is not. The assessment makes clear that
mandatory scanning of images and text, especially in encrypted data, is the
only solution the Commission will consider.  [...]

 colon cancer growths (The Straits Times)

https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/ai-to-act-as-doctor-s-second-pair-of-eyes-to-s
pot-nearly-invisible-colon-cancer-growths

  Developed with the help of biomedical company Medtronic, the tool is able
  to detect roughly 20^ more growths -- or polyps -- that doctors would
  otherwise miss with the human eye, according to studies by SKH.

  Endoscope image processing by AI to discern near invisible (to the naked
  eye) polyps during a gastroscopy.

  FDA's TPLC platform identifies, to date, 4 separate devices under Product
  Code QNP (gastrointestinal lesion software detection system). See
  https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfTPLC/tplc.cfm?id=2260&min_report_year=2018
  for device approval information. The polyp detector stack is defined as,
  ``A gastrointestinal lesion software detection system is a
  computer-assisted detection device used in conjunction with endoscopy for
  the detection of abnormal lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. This
  device with advanced software algorithms brings attention to images to aid
  in the detection of lesions. The device may contain hardware to support
  interfacing with an endoscope.''

No medical device reports for device or patient problems. Stay tuned to this
space.

Among the many procedural risks (e.g., an unsterilized endoscope) for
gastroscopy is perforation -- the endoscope, via the gastroenterologist,
pokes a hole through your intestine.

Need to wonder if the polyp detector false negative/positive outcome might
advise over-aggressive polyp biopsy frequency that elevates perforation
risk.

AI-Powered 'BlackMamba' Keylogging Attack Evades Modern EDR Security

Researchers warn that polymorphic malware created with ChatGPT and other
LLMs will force a reinvention of security automation.

Researchers from HYAS Labs demonstrated the proof-of-concept attack, which
they call BlackMamba, which exploits a large language model (LLM) -- the
technology on which ChatGPT is based -- to synthesize a polymorphic
keylogger functionality on the fly. The attack is "truly polymorphic" in
that every time BlackMamba executes, it resynthesizes its keylogging
capability, the researchers wrote.

The BlackMamba attack, outlined in a blog post, demonstrates how AI can
allow the malware to dynamically modify benign code at runtime without any
command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, allowing it to slip past current
automated security systems that are attuned to look out for this type of
behavior to detect attacks.

Subject: Re: Why I'm sticking up for science (RISKS-33.64-65)

While I also consider the Dawkins editorial to be a rant whose aim,
poorly-circumscribed as it may be, is not fully on topic for RISKS, I find
that zeurkous' response highlights the RISK that the original submission
highlighted.

There is risk to society at large when relativism is placed on equal
standing with empiricism. The "special treatment" afforded to "Western"
science is earned by the fact that all people can, in fact, access and
verify it. There is no special belief system or ancestral qualification
required. It is important to point out that there are traditional beliefs
that are not evaluated by the world at large (yet another RISK!), but when
they are they also become part of this shared science, this consensus
reality that scientists and observers everywhere participate in.

Advocating for the promulgation of beliefs and systems of belief that are
not to be questioned or verified, simply because they have also been held by
some people at some time, erodes solidarity. It erodes the trust that any
person can have in the mass of people, because there is now this doubt about
whether everyone is willing to perceive the same reality.  Unfortunately,
signs point to us all *living* in the same reality -- whether colonized,
colonizer, independent, or uncontacted -- and we cannot play together nicely
if some of us insist on playing another game altogether.

Subject: Re: Why I'm sticking up for science (RISKS-33.64-65)

I suppose I didn't bother to make any response to the post by Geoff
Goodfellow citing in detail a Spectator article by Richard Dawkins because,
as a scientist and a Roman Catholic, I am always astounded by the sheer
ignorance of Dawkins and his ilk about what religion is and - amazingly -
about how science proceeds. This was just more of the same, no doubt causing
eyes of many a reader to glaze over and pass on to the next item.

If I may put this into a way of talking that is actually relevant to the
objectives of this list, the RISK is that the boundaries between religion
and science get deliberately blurred by people who have a naive world view
of both and who promote these world views with sophistical rhetoric and
cheap knock-down arguments against a parody of what religious belief is.

The article cited by Geoff Goodfellow is a good example of how irrational
emotions may be stirred by those peddling this RISKY behaviour, leading to
untenable positions on both topics.

Dr Dick Dawkins goes too far.  It's one thing to argue when pseudo science
gets in the door, but another thing entirely to argue cultural values need
to be kept at arms length.  He does it in The God Delusion -- he undoes his
own arguments with cloying appeals to science as the great reset against
humanist encroachment.  New Zealand has a river and a mountain with
personhood.  It's wonderful progress.  Science will be brought forward and
made stronger.  Does Dawkins still oppose the chiropractic as anti-science?

Subject: Re: Everyone is special, SMS-Based Multi-Factor Authentication

(John and I chatted a little offline about some of this) Unfortunately, at
least insofar as I can see wandering around within my Vanguard account and
talking with Vanguard support, Vanguard does NOT use ONLY whatever 2FA you
have configured; Vanguard REQUIRES a mobile phone, and literally says at the
security key login prompt page "If you don't have your security key, you can
always request a security code".  In other words, as I said initially,
Vanguard (like BoA) lets you buy and set up a physical security token, but
also always allow you to bypass it - making the physical security token of
exactly zero real security value.

I checked in with John about it and he also found the "would you like to
bypass the real user's strong security and use weak security that you can
attack?"  prompt by Vanguard. (eyeroll)

John then observed: >Ugh, you're right.  Vanguard are pretty sophisticated
so I would guess they think that it is a lot more people who forget their
passwords than who get SIM swapped.

Undoubtedly true, though the fallibility of the average user shouldn't mean
that we godlike security people have to accept less security than we're
willing to hamstring ourselves with ... (insert "eye roll" emoji here,
again)

John continued:
>I also wonder if they have different security for different sizes of
>accounts.

Sadly, nope. My parents have one of those "bigger size" accounts, and I've
spoken directly with their named Vanguard representative, who couldn't come
up with anything else/better (and, when pressed, never responded at all...
very disappointing). (Though, as John also noted, maybe in the millions and
millions and ... size accounts? Dunno. Shouldn't have to be in the top 1% to
have adequate security !)

Lastly, in response to the newer comments about why 2FA really is necessary,
about the recent hacks of LastPass, while those hacks are serious, they
don't in the near-term make a secured-with-a-strong-unique-password account
directly vulnerable (the vaults that were stolen remained encrypted, so if
the LastPass master password was good, there's still a practically safe
amount of time before a vault could be brute forced). But, yes, still - 2FA
is unfortunately NEEDED now for ... basically everything.  (And, then, yes,
adequate, at least as safe recoverability for when 2FA fails, is also
needed).

Subject: Re: Why the Floppy Disk Just Won't Die (RISKS 33.65)

Of course, most of the "floppy disks" as referenced in the WIRED article are
not floppy at all. They are mainly the 3.5" diskettes that supplanted the
earlier 5-1/4" disks that were truly floppy, whence the appellation. The
sobriquet was carried forward to their replacement, even though floppiness
ceased to be an attribute. (The WIRED article alludes only to the 3.5" and
much earlier 8" disks without mentioning the once-commonplace 5-1/4" ones at
all.)

I tried to adopt the practice of referring to the 3.5" disks as *stiffs*,

Subject: Re: rm -rf (Bacher, RISKS-33.66)

In response to Steve Bacher's comment:

It's not typically necessary to use subshells with -e or pipefail turned
off: the -e option in bash already has mechanisms to prevent the shell from
terminating when _anticipated_ commands return a nonzero exit status:

  The shell does not exit if the command that fails is part of the command
  list immediately following a while or until keyword, part of the test
  following the if or elif reserved words, part of any command executed in a
  && or || list except the command following the final && or ||, any command
  in a pipeline but the last, or if the command's return value is being
  inverted with !.

The common idiom is to append "&& true" or "|| true" to commands or
pipelines you don't want to trigger the behaviour of -e if they fail, e.g.:

    set -e
    grep pattern "$FILENAME" | wc -l || true

will not cause the shell to exit even if the grep command returns a non-zero
exit status (whether this is because the pattern is not found in the named
file, because the named file does not exist or is not readable, because the
FILENAME variable is not set and "set -u" is in effect, or for any other
reason--so caution is still needed in permitting the script to continue in
not making unwarranted assumptions about the reason the pipeline failed).

Using "|| true" makes the intention of ignoring the success of failure of
the command or pipeline apparent; using "&& true" is perhaps slightly less
intuitive, but has the advantage of allowing the script to evaluate the
return status of the pipeline; e.g., "case $? in 1) [...]".

the html crap from a strictly UTF-8 digest.  Sorry when i don't.]

Yes, that's another approach; I would go further and encase it in a
subshell:

        (cd foo && rm -rf ...)

to ensure that the cd does not affect the remainder of the script.  In that
way you get the same outcome, in terms of the environment, following the
execution of the cd and rm whether the cd "takes" or not.

If you actually want to change the current working directory for the
remainder of the script, this doesn't apply.

Yup, I have the same problem.

Password? Whatp password? Eventbrite lets you enter a mail address
that they don't verify. As you just discovered, if you give Eventbrite
the wrong address, you don't get the tickets so there is a strong
incentive to provide a real address. (Unless, I suppose, the tickets
are delivered in the web transaction and the mail is just a copy. I
haven't bought tix from them for a very long time and don't remember.)

I suppose they could verify the address by sending a test message you have
to click on, but there is a tradeoff: some fraction of people would give up
and not complete the transaction, so I can't really blame them.
