Subject: Dangers of emoticons that we Had Not Considered

Emoticons in texts can rack up huge bills
Jane Wakefield, BBC, 5 February 2015
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-31148424

Many people use icons in text messages as a way of expressing emotions

  'More diverse' emoji faces planned
  New emojis developed for smartphones
  Apple seeks greater emoji diversity

People using emoticons (emojis) that denote happy, sad or other emotions in
their text messages could be racking up big bills, the BBC has learned.
Consumer website MoneySavingExpert has received a large number of complaints
about the issue.  It seems to affect older models of phones, including some
Samsung and Apple handsets.  In Scotland, a woman ran up bills totaling
over £1,000 after adding emoticons to text messages.  Sad face

The issue revolves around how the handset interprets the icons, known as
emoticons or emojis.  In some cases, especially on older handsets, the
emoticons are converted into MMS (multi-media service) messages, which can
cost up to 40p each depending on the network.  [PGN-ed...  This is enough
to make some people emote even more.  (:< ]

Subject: The curious case of the disappearing Polish S*?

This is an interesting story of how a combination events over decades
resulted in a small annoying bug.  The conclusion is that given enough time,
there won't be people around who recognize the history and reasons.  An
implication is that it may be more difficult to find such bugs.

I think the regular RISKS reader can generalize this to a much broader set
of things that may start popping up in decades to come.

Takeaway: assumptions and workarounds are contextual, and context changes
with time.

  The cost and hassle of repairing modern tractors has soured a lot of

  tractors (without all the digital bells and whistles) has picked up.  ``As

Subject: Hackers could open doors of BMW's with "Connected Drive" option

According to BMW this vulnerability has now been patched.

At the time of my initial investigation, ConnectedDrive included six
security vulnerabilities:
  -BMW uses the same symmetric keys in all vehicles.
  -Some services do not encrypt messages in transit between the car
   and the BMW backend.
  -The ConnectedDrive configuration data isn't tamper-proof.
  -The Combox discloses the VIN via NGTP error messages.
  -NGTP data sent via text messages is encrypted with the insecure
   DES method.
  -The Combox does not implement protection to guard against replay
   attacks.

Details:
http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Beemer-Open-Thyself-Security-vulnerabilities-in-BMW-s-ConnectedDrive-2540957.html

My "Risks" lessons - some old stories:

The use of "Global Keys" in a large network is a SIN! (point 1 above)

Vulnerabilities often result from backward compatibility. In this case the
hacker can reverse engineer the oldest (cheapest) BMW he can find with
Connected Drive.

Security through obscurity is vulnerable, because reverse-engineering
techniques have become alarmingly powerful.

The high-level design may be (fairly) secure, but vulnerabilities can be
found in the configuration details.

actually applying Title II properly, in a way consistent with the limits
described here (and his commentary has clearly been inconsistent with this
characterization, both all along and at the moment of this announcement of

Susan Crawford, The Internet Is Back to Solid Regulatory Ground
Feb 5 2015

http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/02/04/regulate-internet-providers/the-internet-is-back-to-solid-regulatory-ground

The news that the head of the Federal Communications Commission just
proposed that the agency should use its authority -- under Title II of the
Telecommunications Act -- to oversee high-speed Internet access services
should be welcomed by all who use the Internet.

But let's be clear about what this is and isn't.

He's not proposing to "regulate the Internet" or the websites of businesses
that use the Internet to reach customers. This would not constrain what
Americans can say online, nor would it constrain the extraordinary
innovation that has come about because of the Internet's borderless and
permission-free nature.

Tom Wheeler is simply saying that the F.C.C. should have solid legal
authority over the physical wires, tubes and towers located in the United
States that move information from Point A to Point B. And that's all he's
doing.

Today, the private operators of this basic, two-way communications
infrastructure -- in effect, the general-purpose replacement for the
telephone network -- are free of any oversight. Left to their own devices,
the companies selling Internet access will reasonably act to discriminate
against existing competitors, make entry by new competitors more difficult,
and make more money any way they can from their existing infrastructure --
including by collaborating with one another to divide markets.

The F.C.C. has been worried about this kind of thing for a while now. But
because a prior F.C.C. had taken a sharp deregulatory turn under
then-chairman (now cable industry advocate) Michael Powell -- who put
high-speed Internet access in an unregulated category under the Telecom Act
-- the Obama-era F.C.C. was powerless to address these problems. The D.C.
federal court of appeals twice told the F.C.C. that it couldn't regulate
with one hand, by imposing "Open Internet" rules, for example, and
deregulate with the other.

Now, the chairman is saying that the F.C.C. will return to the solid
regulatory ground that made the commercial Internet possible in the first
place. High-speed Internet access is indeed a regulated service. This may
not be good news for Comcast, Verizon, AT&T and Time Warner Cable -- who,
among other things, want to make more money by demanding extra payments from
popular online companies like Netflix -- but it is great news for every
other part of American society.

Subject: UK access to NSA mass surveillance data was illegal, court rules
  (David Meyer)

David Meyer, GigaOM, 6 Feb 2015, via Dave Farber
https://gigaom.com/2015/02/06/uk-access-to-nsa-mass-surveillance-data-was-illegal-court-rules/

The system through which U.K. spy agency GCHQ can access data from NSA mass
surveillance programs was in violation of fundamental rights, the
Investigatory Powers Tribunal has ruled. However, the limits of that finding
have left human rights groups dissatisfied.
<https://gigaom.com/2014/10/28/uk-spies-can-get-intercepted-communications-from-nsa-without-warrant-government-lawyers-admit/>

The decision came as a result of a case brought about by Privacy
International, Liberty and other human rights groups regarding the Prism and
Upstream programs. Prism is the scheme through which U.S. intelligence gets
users' communications from service providers in that country, and Upstream
intercepts bulk data from the Internet's core infrastructure.
<http://www.ipt-uk.com/docs/Liberty_Ors_Judgment_6Feb15.pdf>

In December the IPT ruled that it was legal in principle for GCHQ get data
from these programs now -- i.e., from December 2014, in the post-Snowden
world, where people actually know what's going on -- but it held back on
saying whether there had been historical breaches of human rights.
<https://gigaom.com/2014/12/05/uk-cable-tapping-programs-are-legal-spy-court-rules/>

Having subsequently heard out both the complainants and the intelligence
agencies, the tribunal said on Friday that the data-sharing regime had
violated the rights to privacy and free expression, as set out in Articles 8
and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, it reiterated
that it believes the system now no longer does so.
<http://www.ipt-uk.com/docs/Liberty-Order6Feb15.pdf>
<http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf>

In a statement on Friday, Privacy International said it and Pakistani NGO
Bytes For All would ask the IPT, which generally acts as a secret court, to
``confirm whether their communications had been unlawfully collected prior
to December 2014 and, if so, demand their immediate deletion.''
<https://gigaom.com/2014/01/09/pakistani-human-rights-group-sues-uk-government-over-surveillance/>

The groups also disputed the December ruling's assertion that the disclosure
of ``a limited subset of rules governing intelligence-sharing and mass
surveillance'' made everything OK. They will now appeal that ruling with the
European Court of Human Rights, as will Liberty.

Here's what Liberty legal director James Welch said in the statement:

We now know that, by keeping the public in the dark about their secret
dealings with the National Security Agency, GCHQ acted unlawfully and
violated our rights. That their activities are now deemed lawful is thanks
only to the degree of disclosure Liberty and the other claimants were able
to force from our secrecy-obsessed Government.

But the Intelligence Services retain a largely unfettered power to rifle
through millions of people's private communications, and the Tribunal
believes the limited safeguards revealed during last year's legal
proceedings are an adequate protection of our privacy. We disagree, and will
be taking our fight to the European Court of Human Rights.

``We must not allow agencies to continue justifying mass surveillance
programs using secret interpretations of secret laws,'' Privacy
International deputy director Eric King added. ``The world owes Edward
Snowden a great debt for blowing the whistle, and today's decision is a
vindication of his actions.''

Subject: PSA: Your crypto apps are useless unless you check them for backdoors
  (Dan Goodin)

Dan Goodin, Ars Technica, 4 Feb 2015
Paranoid, or: How I learned to stop griping and love digital signatures.
<http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/psa-your-crypto-apps-are-useless-unless-you-check-them-for-backdoors/>

At the beginning of the year, I did something I've never done before: I made
a new year's resolution. From here on out, I pledged, I would install only
digitally signed software I could verify hadn't been tampered with by
someone sitting between me and the website that made it available for
download.

It seemed like a modest undertaking, but in practice, it has already cost me
a few hours of lost time. With practice, it's no longer the productivity
killer it was. Still, the experience left me smarting. In some cases, the
extra time I spent verifying signatures did little or nothing to make me
more secure. And too many times, the sites that took the time to provide
digital signatures gave little guidance on how to use them. Even worse, in
one case, subpar security practices of some software providers undercut the
protection that's supposed to be provided with digitally signed code. And in
one extreme case, I installed the Adium instant messaging program with no
assurance at all, effectively crossing my fingers that it hadn't been
maliciously modified by state-sponsored spies or criminally motivated
hackers. More about those deficiencies later -- let's begin first with an
explanation of why digital signatures are necessary and how to go about
verifying them.

By now, most people are familiar with man-in-the-middle attacks. They're
waged by someone with the ability to monitor traffic passing between an end
user and a website -- for instance, a hacker sniffing an unsecured Wi-Fi
connection or the National Security Agency sniffing the Internet
backbone. When the data isn't encrypted, the attacker can not only read
private communications but also replace legitimate software normally
available for download with maliciously modified software. If the attack is
done correctly, the end user will have no idea what's happening. Even when
Web connections are encrypted with the HTTPS standard, highly skilled
hackers still may be able to seed a website with malicious counterfeit
downloads. That's where digital signatures come in.

A prime candidate for such an attack is the OTR plugin for the Pidgin
instant messenger. It provides the means to encrypt messages so (1) they
can't be read by anyone monitoring the traffic sent between two parties and
(2) each party can know for sure that the person on the other end is, in
fact, who she claims to be. Fortunately, the OTR installer is provided
through an encrypted HTTPS connection, which goes a long way to thwarting
would-be man-in-the-middle attackers. But strict security practices require
more, especially for software as sensitive as OTR. That's why the developers
included a GPG signature users can check to verify that the executable file
hasn't been altered in any way.

I ended up burning about 90 minutes figuring out how to verify the signature
using Gpg4win, the Windows-based e-mail encryption suite Ars wrote about
almost two years ago. No doubt, more technically adept people than me would
have spent only a small fraction of the time I did, but that misses the
point. In a post-Snowden era, encryption is no longer the exclusive domain
of developers, hackers, and technology professionals. Increasingly, it's a
prerequisite for lawyers, journalists, and anyone else duty-bound to keep
secrets.

OTR didn't provide instructions, so I'll show how I did it, with the
understanding that installation of Gpg4win, the Mac-based GnuPG, or a
similar program for Linux is a prerequisite. (Fortunately, Gpg4win is
digitally signed with a key that has been verified by a recognized
certificate authority. The digital signature and checksums available online
provide further verification.) First I downloaded the pidgin-otr-4.0.1.exe
installer, the GPG signature for that file, and the public key the OTR
developers used to generate the signature. I then opened Kleopatra, a key
management program included with Gpg4win, clicked the Import button, and
navigated to the directory storing the public key. (Alternatively, I could
have right-clicked on the signature file and highlighted "More GpgEX
options" and selected "Import keys.") Like magic, Kleopatra showed the key
as belonging to the OTR Dev Team. [,,,]

Terrorists have almost no military strength so they create a spectacle.  How

reflects on the past, and alarming future, of the fear factor

Yuval Noah Harari, 31 January 2015

As the literal meaning of the word indicates, terror is a military strategy
that hopes to change the political situation by spreading fear rather than
by causing material damage.  This strategy is almost always adopted by very
weak parties, who are unable to inflict much material damage on their
enemies.  Of course, every military action spreads fear.  But in
conventional warfare, fear is a byproduct of material losses, and is usually
proportional to the force inflicting the losses.  In terrorism, fear is the
whole story, and there is an astounding disproportion between the actual
strength of the terrorists and the fear they manage to inspire. [PGN-ed ...]
