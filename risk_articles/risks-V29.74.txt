New hacking technique stealthily changes memory of virtual servers,
12 Aug 2016

<http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/dr20160812-new-hacking-technique-stealthily-changes-memory-of-virtual-servers>

For the first time ever a team of Dutch hacking experts managed to alter the
memory of virtual machines in the cloud without a software bug, using a new
attack technique.

With this technique an attacker can crack the keys of secured virtual
machines or install malware without it being noticed. It is a new
de-duplication-based attack in which data can not only be viewed and leaked,
but also modified using a hardware glitch. By doing so the attacker can
order the server to install malicious and unwanted software or allow logins
by unauthorized persons.

De-duplication and Rowhammer bug VUA notes that with the new attack
technique Flip Feng Shui (FSS), an attacker rents a virtual machine on the
same host as the victim. This can be done by renting many virtual machines
until one of them lands next to the victim. A virtual machine in the cloud
is often used to run applications, test new software, or run a Web
site. There are public (for everyone), community (for a select group), and
private (for one organization accessible) clouds. The attacker writes a
memory page that he knows exists in the victim on the vulnerable memory
location and lets it de-duplicate. As a result, the identical pages will be
merged into one in order to save space (the information is, after all, the
same). That page is stored in the same part of the memory of the physical
computer. The attacker can now modify the information in the general memory
of the computer. This can be done by triggering a hardware bug dubbed
Rowhammer, which causes flip bits from 0 to 1 or vice versa, to seek out the
vulnerable memory cells and change them.

Cracking OpenSSH

The researchers of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, who worked together
with a researcher from the Catholic University of Leuven, describe in their
research two attacks on the operating systems Debian and Ubuntu. The first
FFS attack gained access to the virtual machines through weakening OpenSSH
public keys.  The attacker did this by changing the victim's public key in
one bit.  In the second attack, the settings of the software management
application apt were adjusted by making minor changes to the URL from where
apt downloads software. The server could then install malware that presents
itself as a software update. The integrity check could be circumvented by
making a small change to the public key that verifies the integrity of the
apt-get software packages. [...]

selected text [PGN-ed]:

Apple's tax benefits in Ireland are illegal, and the company will have to
pay up to the equivalent of roughly US$14.5 billion in back taxes, plus
interest.  The investigation found that Apple's effective tax rate on profit
reported in Ireland was just 1/2000, falling to 1/20000 in 2014.  Apple and
the Irish tax authority disputed the commission's charges.

Vestager said that Irish tax authorities had allowed Apple to split profit
from the two companies, which were subject to normal taxes, with "head
office" companies that were subject to no taxes, either in Ireland or
elsewhere.  "Splitting the profits did not have any factual or economic
justification. The so-called head office had no employees, no premises, no
real activities," she said. Those head-office companies were allocated
almost all the profits.  This selective tax treatment in Ireland is illegal
under European Union state aid rules, she said, and distorts competition.

John Markoff, *The New York Times*, 1 Sep 2016 [in the 2 Sep paper], via ACM
TechNews, Friday, September 2, 2016

Researchers from Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft are forming
an alliance to establish an ethical standard for artificial intelligence
(AI) development.  Four people involved in the alliance's foundation say the
group's intent is to make sure AI research is focused on societal benefits
and not harm.  One of the group's executives, Microsoft researcher Eric
Horvitz, recipient of the 2015 ACM AAAI Allen Newell Award, sponsors a
Stanford University group that on Thursday issued a report underscoring the
value of the industry effort.  The report's authors warn it will be
impossible to regulate AI, "since there is no clear definition of AI (it
isn't any one thing), and the risks and considerations are very different in
different domains."  Study co-author and University of Texas at Austin
researcher Peter Stone recommends boosting awareness of and expertise about
AI at all levels of government.  Both the AI industry group and a proposed
initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) seek to
investigate AI's social and economic implications, with the latter
discussing the design of new AI and robotic systems with "society in the
loop."  "What we want to do is support and reinforce the social scientists
who are doing research which will play a role in setting policies," says MIT
Media Lab director Joichi Ito.

Subject: You Can Now Chat With Your Hotel Room, and It's Only Going to Get

Last Wednesday, Starwood's tech-centric hotel brand, Aloft unveiled its

talk to their rooms, thanks to the help of Apple's ubiquitous voice-powered
assistant, Siri.
http://www.bloomberg.com/Research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=7685157

  Siri, raise the temperature to 68 degrees, or, Siri, turn out the bathroom
  light, a guest might say -— if they were staying at Aloft's Boston Seaport
  locations, where Project Jetson is currently piloting.  or Santa Clara.

  Depending on your outlook regarding hospitality, that may seem unnecessary
  or frivolous -- or scarily futuristic. But maybe you've already learned
  first-hand that when most of these functions are embedded on bedside
  tablet devices, they quickly get buggy with age. Or maybe you've gotten
  into a tightly tucked bed after a long day of meetings, only to find that
  a light is still on and there's no way to turn it off remotely. Then you
  know that Project Jetson isn't just about technology for technology's
  sake; it's about making your hotel room more intuitive.

I hope it's more deterministic than my car's voice control, only selectively
understanding my verbal commands. On a good day I can change radio stations
or turn on rear window defroster. On a bad day, anything I haven't requested
can happen. I can't wait to experience that suspense and excitement in a
voice-controlled self-driving car. Or even hotel room.

Plus, of course -- the walls will always be listening. I had that experience
recently -- ending phone call, iPad across room. I said "Thanks for your
help" and iPad responded politely with something like "You're welcome". I'm
sure Project Jetson will archive/analyze what it hears purely for analysis
and improvement and will maintain complete confidentiality. The fact that
"privacy" doesn't appear in the article must be just an oversight.

Amy Golod, *U.S. News and World Report*, 31 Aug 2016, via ACM TechNews,
Friday, September 2, 2016

The College Board's new advanced placement (AP) Computer Science Principles
course will introduce computer science and programming fundamentals to
U.S. high school students, with a focus on collaboration and creativity.
Unlike the existing AP Computer Science A course, the new course will not
require previous knowledge of programming languages and technology, and it
is aimed at making computing accessible to underrepresented demographics.
Students will be exposed to a variety of applications and programming
languages through project-based learning.  In addition to algorithms and
programming, the course will concentrate on the global effects of computing
and the ethical usage of data.  "We're focusing not just on the knowledge we
want students to have, but the practices and experiences we want them to
have before they leave the course," says the College Board's Richard Kick.
Now that a three-year pilot program has concluded, Computer Science
Principles will launch in the fall and consist of two projects and a final
exam.  For one project, students will use a digital medium to explain the
development of a computer science application; for the second project,
students will build an app using a programming language of their choice.
The project-based approach is intended to engage classes filled with
students who have varying levels of programming experience.

Subject: Beyond CAPTCHAs to frustration

Choice Hotels (www.choicehotels.com) is using some of the more advanced
CAPTCHAs - e.g., "which of these pictures has a house number".  Today I've
run into a new version which has me completely stumped - a large image
broken into squares, and the question "which of these blocks has a street
sign".  The street signs are frequently split across multiple blocks, and
they're not necessarily American or international standards (e.g., one had
signs in Chinese, but I don't know if those are street signs).  So I'm in
the position of trying to figure out what an image recognition system thinks
is a street sign - e.g., is a small street sign at an oblique angle
something it will recognize?  What if it's the name of a street where some
of the letters are in one block and others in another?  How about a vertical
sign that spans several blocks, where the bottom part of the sign is just a
solid color - does that count?  I've encountered all of these and many more
edge cases in the past few minutes.

After about 10 tries, I have been unsuccessful at getting logged in.  I
wonder if they track the failure rate?

The RISK is that a clever algorithm (in this case image recognition) that a
human is presumed to be able to understand (but a computerized system is
not) may be too smart for its own good.

three key parts that undermine Vermont's popular GMO labeling bill and make
it nearly impossible for Americans to know what's in their food. [...]

In the early 1990s, a European genetic engineering company was preparing to
field test its genetically modified version of /Klebsiella planticola/,
which it had tested in the lab and presumed to be safe. But if it weren't

Extreme? Exaggerated? Valid? Can't tell. But legislating against providing
information seems inherently suspicious behavior. Right up there with
"Nothing to see here, move along."

Subject: Re: They really did remove the streets from Google Maps
  (Jacobson, RISKS-29.73)

Google Maps' de-emphasis of streets is (in my opinion) an improvement for
users traveling rural roads, where road condition is crucial.  Their
previous presentation often showed "roads" which were nothing more than two
tire tracks through a grassy field.  Even in satellite view, their previous
intense white lines often hid the actual condition of the road from view.
