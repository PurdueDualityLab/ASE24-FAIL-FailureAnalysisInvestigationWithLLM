Facebook Inc. on Wednesday banned from its platform a quiz app that could
have exposed the data of up to four million users, after the developers
declined to be audited by the social-media giant as part of its effort to
track down potential abuses.

Facebook said it banned the app, called myPersonality, “for failing to agree
to our request to audit and because it is clear that they shared information
with researchers as well as companies with only limited protections in
place.”

French students are about to get a much-needed detox from their cellphones
now that the government has banned them during school for kids 15 and under.
When will our educational system follow France's lead?

Sadly, most schools in the United States are turning a blind eye to a
looming public health crisis. What are we waiting for? A tragedy? Ten years
of data? A lost generation? Not on my watch. These are my children, their
peers and their friends. As a parent, I will not allow them to be guinea
pigs or data points. We have to do something.

  This company is giving them virtual eyes.  (WashPo)

Trust, by definition, is the firm reliance on the integrity, ability, or
character of a person or thing.

Human-driven vehicles, based on 2016 statistics, are known to cause ~37K
fatalities/year, a fatality rate of 1.18 per 100 million vehicle miles
traveled. This finding indicates misplaced trust in their safety, and a high
dependence that is not easily severed despite the risk.
  <https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812554)>

When silicon-driven vehicles equivalence or over-achieve (meaning greater
than 1.18) this fatality rate, then public trust will have reached a
justifiable tipping point favoring autonomous vehicles. Until this
demonstration, blind trust in a virtually eyed vehicle is a non sequitur.

Subject: U.S. regulation of auto technologies (Car and Driver)

The September 2018 issue asks and answers 20 questions for 2019. Here's
question 10: What sorts of good technologies are we missing out on because
of our plodding governmental bureaucracy?

"Laser and adaptive-beam headlights that precisely brighten areas in the
driver's view are rolling out on luxury vehicles across Europe, but they're
illegal or dimmed down in the U.S. due to government regulations crafted in
the sealed-beam, Scotch-at-the-office era.

"[T]he latest safety innovations -- automated vehicles and semiautomated
driver-assist features -- aren't blocked at all. Instead, the government is
allowing companies to flood our cars with unchecked software without a
national standard or oversight.

"In 2017, lawmakers in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate
introduced legislation that would allow each automaker to exempt tens of
thousands of Level 3, 4, and 5 automated vehicles from Federal Motor Vehicle
Safety Standards that have been in place since 1966. Some states require
manufacturers to obtain permits to test driverless vehicles on public roads,
but others [forgo, not forego] these restrictions altogether. [E]ven
automakers like Toyota admit there's been 'some irrational exuberance'
toward the capability of current automation systems. [T]he auto industry's
attitude toward safety has historically prioritized cost savings over people
(see Ford's infamous Pinto memo suggesting that settling with the victims of
fiery crashes would be cheaper than fixing the affected cars). In this case,
some more plodding from our bureaucrats might be a good thing."

``The death of a woman hit by a self-driving car highlights an unfolding
technological crisis, as code piled on code creates ‘a universe no one fully
understands.' ''

Maintenance consumes more than 80% of software life cycle expense.
Long-term investment is required to sustain viable stack publication
capability.

Institutional memory and knowledge transition, defect history, release life
cycle maturity and discipline, test assets (plans, cases, infrastructure,
etc.), user/design/requirement documentation, and configuration management
consistency/traceability influence stack maintenance.

Maintenance challenges accrue as changes (defect repair or feature
introduction) are introduced and release history evolves, complicated by
staff and management turnover.  A "SMOP" -- small matter of programming --
evolves into an oxymoron.

Do we still have to remind people while hacking challenges are a bad idea?

If their security is really bad, I suppose it's possible someone might crack
it and tell them, along the lines of the recent note about the teenager who
found a hole and deleted the entire vote database.

If nobody cracks it, all that means is that nobody has admitted to cracking
it.  Maybe it's secure, maybe someone broke in and didn't tell them, maybe
nobody broke in but it'll get more serious attention if it's used for close
elections.

This is a problem but it's hardly a high tech issue.  Account churning has
been a problem ever since there were brokers and commissions.  CFR �
240.15c1-7 makes it illegal and was last updated in 1976, but I think it

Subject: Re: Comments on RISKS-30.79 (Drewe, RISKS-30.81)

Almost 16 years ago, my daughter registered the personal domain rossde.com
for me as a gift.  Since then, I have changed E-mail hosts twice without
having to notify anyone of the change.  Each time, all I had to do was
subscribe to the hosting service, prepay the initial subscription fee, and
request the service to have the DNS routing changed.

Renewing that domain now costs US$10.95 per year, about $2 more than it did
when it was first registered.  Registering and renewing are easy.  The
hardest task is deciding what the domain should be after eliminating domains
that are already registered to someone else.

Note however that some hosting services require that subscribers use only
the service's domain in their E-mail address.  It was not hard for me to
find a service that allowed me to use my own domain.

Subject: Re: What3words: putting geographical addresses behind a closed API
  (RISKS-30.80)

IMHO the bigger problem is not that the system is proprietary, but rather a
more basic one: What's the purpose of such a system?  Actually, most of the
world is already using a 3-word scheme: place, street name, house number.
It makes much more sense that similar addresses are close together -- if I
get to 221 Baker st. by mistake instead of 223 Baker st., it's easy to look
around.

There is the opposite problem -- my house is built on a 30m x 30m lot,
which means it has 100 addresses in the proposed scheme!  How can anyone
tell that they all point to the same house (except by searching each one in
their db)?

I also find that addresses of this scheme are impossible to remember, when
none of the 3 words of an address bears any relation to an actual place.
