Subject: GPS Isn't Very Secure. Here's Why We Need A Backup (WiReD)

Earth got a warning shot on January 25, 2016. On that day, Air Force
engineers were scheduled to kill off a GPS satellite named SVN-23—the oldest
in the navigation constellation. SVN-23 should have just gone to rest in
peace.  But when engineers took it offline, its disappearance triggered,
according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a software
bug that left the timing of some of the remaining GPS satellites -- 15 of
them -- off by 13.7 microseconds.

That's not a lot to you. If your watch is off by 13.7 microseconds, you'll
make it to your important meeting just fine. But it wasn't so nice for the
first-responders in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Louisiana, whose
GPS devices wouldn't lock with satellites. Nor for the FAA ground
transceivers that got fault reports. Nor the Spanish digital TV networks
that had receiver issues. Nor the BBC digital radio listeners, whose British
broadcast got disrupted. It caused about 12 hours of problems -- none too
huge, all annoying. But it was a solid case study for what can happen when
GPS messes up.

The 24 satellites that keep GPS services running in the US aren't especially
secure; they're vulnerable to screw-ups, or attacks of the cyber or
corporeal kind. And as more countries get closer to having their own fully
functional GPS networks, the threat to our own increases. Plus, GPS
satellites don't just enable location and navigation services: They also
give ultra-accurate timing measurements to utility grid operators, stock
exchanges, data centers, and cell networks. To mess them up is to mess those
up.  So private companies and the military are coming to terms with the
consequences of a malfunction -- and they're working on backups. [...]

Subject: AI-Aided Cameras Mean No More Car Mirrors, No More Blind Spots
  (IEEE Spectrum)

According to the World Health Organization, more than 1.25-million people
around the world die from road accidents each year. Consequently, the United
Nations has set a target of halving this number by 2020. A new technology
being readied for its debut could be a step forward in achieving that
ambitious goal: greatly improved automotive video cameras meant to replace
mirrors on vehicles.

In its annual R&D Open House on 14 February, Mitsubishi Electric described
the development of what it believes is the industry's highest-performance
rendition of mirrorless car technology. According to the company, today's
conventional camera-based systems featuring motion detection technology can
detect objects up to about 30 meters away and identify them with a low
accuracy of 14 percent. By comparison, Mitsubishi's new mirrorless
technology extends the recognition distance to 100 meters with an 81 percent
accuracy.

“Motion detection can't see objects if they are a long distance away,” says
Kazuo Sugimoto, Senior Manager, at Mitsubishi Electric's Image Analytics and
Processing Technology Group, Information Technology R&D Center in Kamakura,
55 km south of Tokyo. “So we have developed an AI-based object-recognition
technology that can instantly detect objects up to about 100 meters away.”

To achieve this, the Mitsubishi system uses two technology processes
consecutively. A computational visual-cognition model first mimics how
humans focus on relevant regions and extract object information from the
background even when the objects are distant from the viewer.

The extracted object data is then fed to Mitsubishi's compact deep learning
AI technology dubbed Maisart. The AI has been taught to classify objects
into distinct categories: trucks; cars; and other objects such as lane
markings. The detected results are then superimposed onto video that appears
on a monitor for the driver to view.

Currently, this superimposing results in objects being displayed with
colored rectangles surrounding them. For instance, a blue rectangle
designates an approaching truck, a yellow rectangle an oncoming car.  “But
this can be done in a number of ways,” says Sugimoto. “We are now testing
out various ideas to find the best method for drivers.”

http://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/advanced-cars/mitsubishi-electric-develops-highperformance-aibased-mirrorless-car-technology

The risks? Maybe too much displayed, data overload? Displays looking like
video games? or maybe it'll be brilliant.

The Zen of Mobile

Evan Schuman, Computerworld, 12 Mar 2018

opening text:

IT has enough to worry about with traditional data breach issues, but now
researchers from Purdue University and the University of Iowa have found
quite a few new security holes in the popular 4G mobile networks.

The potentially worst hole detailed in the study is an authentication
synchronization failure attack. The danger? It allows bad guys to read
incoming and outgoing messages from an employee, permits "stealthy denial"
of selected services and "location of history poisoning," which simply means
it can manipulate location ready to give false information to systems using
location for identity authentication.

Abstract

This technical report analyzes how ultrasound could have led to the AP news
recordings of metallic sounds reportedly heard by diplomats in Cuba.
Beginning with screen shots of the acoustic spectral plots from the AP news,
we reverse engineered ultrasonic signals that could lead to those outcomes
as a result of intermodulation distortion and non-linearities of the
acoustic transmission medium.  We created a proof of concept eavesdropping
device to exfiltrate information by AM modulation over an inaudible
ultrasonic carrier.  When a second inaudible ultrasonic source interfered
with the primary inaudible ultrasonic source, intermodulation distortion
created audible byproducts that share spectral characteristics with audio
from the AP news.  Our conclusion is that if ultrasound played a role in
harming diplomats in Cuba, then a plausible cause is intermodulation
distortion between ultrasonic signals that unintentionally synthesize
audible tones.  In other words, acoustic interference without malicious
intent to cause harm could have led to the audible sensations in Cuba.

Subject: Report highlights how deep packet inspection could be subverted by
  cybercriminals (Tara Seals)

Tara Seals, FierceWireless, 12 Mar 2018
http://www.fiercewireless.com/dpi-espionage-campaign-targets-turkish-dissidents

A series of deep packet inspection (DPI) middleboxes developed by Sandvine
PacketLogic (formerly known as Procera) are apparently being misused by
state-sponsored cybercriminals for espionage purposes and for commercial
gain.

<http://citizenlab.ca/2018/03/bad-traffic-sandvines-packetlogic-devices-deploy-government-spyware-turkey-syria/
According to a Citizen Lab internet scan, DPI boxes on Turk Telekom's
network are being used to redirect hundreds of mobile and fixed users in
Turkey and Syria to spyware when those users attempt to download certain
legitimate Windows applications. Visitors to official vendor websites,
including Avast Antivirus, CCleaner, Opera, and 7-Zip, were observed being
silently redirected to malicious versions bundled with the StrongPity
spyware, as were those who downloaded a wide range of applications from CBS
Interactive's Download.com and FinFisher.

<http://securelist.com/on-the-strongpity-waterhole-attacks-targeting-italian-and-belgian-encryption-users/76147/
<http://www.finfisher.com/FinFisher/index.html

The scans of Turkey revealed that this redirection was happening in at least
five provinces, and Citizen Lab believes the efforts were being carried out
by the ISP at the behest of the Turkish government.

``Based on publicly available information we found on Wi-Fi router pages, at
least one targeted IP address appears to serve YPG (Kurdish militia) users,
YPG has been the target of a Turkish government air and ground offensive
which began in January 2018.  Areas not controlled by the YPG also appear to
be targeted, including the area around Idlib city.''

The Citizen Lab also found similar middleboxes in the Telecom Egypt network
being used to hijack Egyptian internet users' unencrypted web connections en
masse. In this case, the boxes were being used to redirect the users to
affiliate ads and browser cryptocurrency mining scripts in an effort to line
the criminals' pockets.

This kind of redirection can be done via network injection: A DPI middlebox
operates over connections between a target and an internet site he or she is
visiting. If the connection is unauthenticated (e.g., HTTP and not HTTPS),
then the middlebox can be used to tamper with data to inject a spoofed
response from the internet site. The spoofed response may contain redirects
to exploits or spyware to infect and monitor the target.

The Citizen Lab said that it matched characteristics of the network
injection in Turkey and Egypt to Sandvine PacketLogic devices.

``We developed a fingerprint for the injection we found in Turkey, Syria,
and Egypt and matched our fingerprint to a second-hand PacketLogic device
that we procured and measured in a lab setting,'' the group said in an
announcement. [...]

Subject: More on Google and Military Drones

A bit more of my thoughts on Google's military drone AI effort.

One issue that often comes up in such discussions is the difference between
defensive vs. offensive technologies. I remember having discussions about
topics like this at RAND many, many years ago (not drones of course, but
tech efforts that ostensibly aimed at troop defense rather than offense, for
example). The upshot was that in the final analysis, it was impossible to
"wall off" one from the other.  That is, tech designed for the former always
ended up contributing to the latter, either directly or indirectly (I've had
Pentagon types say this to me explicitly, explaining that this is part of
why they fund what seem to be purely defensive efforts -- they know there
will be an offensive side payoff).

With image analysis and target identification, this connection seems
even more direct.

A counter-argument is that better target analysis could in theory help
avoid civilian collateral damage. But I don't believe that is actually
generally true in practice given the nature of the kinds of targets
that drones are used again. These targets tend to be deep in civilian
areas and travel with civilians (including children, other family
members, etc., who typically have no choice about such matters).  No
drone-based image analysis can separate these. Pentagon planners for
years have used drones for attacks with the explicit understanding
that significant civilian losses are part and parcel of such attacks,
and any tech that increases the viability of drone-based attacks will
increase such losses.

Subject: Egyptian jamming of Sinai cell phones affects Israel, Gaza
  (Dan Williams)

Dan Williams, Reuters, 7 Mar 2018

JERUSALEM, March 7 (Reuters) - Israel and Egypt were working to halt
disruptions to mobile phone service after Egyptian jamming against Sinai
insurgents caused outages in neighbouring Israel and the Gaza Strip, Israeli
officials said on Wednesday.

Under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt has quietly cooperated with
Israel on security in the Sinai, a desert peninsula demilitarised as part of
their U.S.-sponsored 1979 peace treaty but where Cairo's forces now operate
freely.

The jamming appeared to catch Israel by surprise, however, prompting what
its communications minister said were talks across the border to resolve
what he called a "crisis".

rest:
http://af.reuters.com/article/africaTech/idAFL5N1QP267

Egypt's military did not immediately comment.

Cairo launched a major sweep of Sinai jihadis loyal to Islamic State on 9
Feb 2018.  Israeli officials said that on 21 Feb Egyptian forces began
jamming a range of cellphone frequencies in Sinai, disrupting reception in
Israel and Gaza.

"We've never seen anything this intensive or protracted. Even the
Palestinians have been coming to us, appealing to make it stop," one Israeli
official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Phones had been disrupted
as far away as Jerusalem and northern Israel, depending on weather, the
official said.

An Egyptian official who also asked not to be identified confirmed
electronic warfare was being waged in the Sinai. "Obviously, we want to stop
terrorists from communicating," he told Reuters.

The official denied that Israel was the intended target of the jamming, but
he said some Sinai insurgents were suspected of using smuggled Israeli SIM
cards, close enough to the border to link up with Israeli cellphone
reception, "which means that we may need to work against a wide range of
frequencies".

Several Palestinian residents of Gaza, the densely populated enclave on the
Egyptian border, told Reuters they had been experiencing problems with phone
service.

A source at one of the two Palestinian mobile phone companies said its
services were disrupted for a day in the past week in southern Gaza but that
the problem had been resolved.

Israeli cellphone provider Partner said several hundred of its customers had
complained about reception problems, but that its 4G network was working
well.  Other leading Israeli providers, Cellcom and Pelephone, did not
immediately respond to requests for comment.

Interviewed by Israel's Army Radio, Communications Minister Ayoob Kara said:
"Without getting into details, for the first time in the south we have been
experiencing an uncomfortable situation".

But he said understandings were reached "after a very important meeting
across the border" on Tuesday, and he believed the disruptions would end
within the next three days.

Gadi Yarkoni, a mayor representing Israeli communities near Gaza, criticised
the Communications Ministry and threatened to sue the phone companies,
saying the failure to fix disruptions "shows disrespect for the residents of
the Gaza periphery".

The Multinational Force & Observers (MFO), an international body set up
under the Israel-Egypt peace agreement to monitor the Sinai, declined to
comment.

  "Digital radio promises greater capacity, but it is sometimes the subject
  of complaints from some police and first responders, who say the systems
  can become finicky during large-scale events.

  "Officers' frustration with the radios got so bad, they started a social
  media campaign to pressure Motorola Solutions to come back to Cincinnati
  and make fixes. The company did, and Hils says the radios are more
  reliable now.  But he still doesn't completely trust the new generation of
  radios in critical incidents, when many people are trying to communicate
  at the same time.

  "There's even a webpage , run by an engineer and owner of an emergency
  radio systems company in

  California, that collects news media accounts of technical problems with
  newer digital systems.

  "But the manufacturers and other defenders of digital radio say the real
  problem tends to be user error, not the technology itself. In Broward
  County, de Zayas says police and other first responders need "good
  end-user education."

  "Agencies need to train their public safety personnel on how to use their
  radios," says de Zayas. "Constant and continuous training on how to use
  the radio."

Is this really a case of UIAI -- user is an idiot? Certain features are
buggy, certain bugs are features, if you use the gear correctly? With
deterministic behavior a guessing game -- apparently -- does public safety

7 Mar2018

Israeli cellular networks have been experiencing interference since
Wednesday, the Communications Ministry said Thursday -- and the reason is
due to Egyptian military activity in Sinai. The Egyptians are apparently
jamming cellular networks in northern Sinai as part of their campaign
against Islamist groups in the region, the Ministry said, responding to the
complaints it has received in the 24-hour period between Wednesday and
Thursday afternoon.

  Adobe Acrobat Reader DC Document ID Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

Today, Talos is releasing details of a new vulnerability within Adobe
Acrobat Reader DC. Adobe Acrobat Reader is the most popular and most
feature-rich PDF reader. It has a big user base, is usually a default PDF
reader on systems and integrates into web browsers as a plugin for rendering
PDFs. As such, tricking a user into visiting a malicious web page or sending
a specially crafted email attachment can be enough to trigger this
vulnerability.

A specific Javascript script embedded in a PDF file can cause the document
ID field to be used in an unbounded copy operation leading to stack-based
buffer overflow when opening a specially crafted PDF document in Adobe
Acrobat Reader DC 2018.009.20044. This stack overflow can lead to return
address overwrite which can result in arbitrary code execution. In order to
trigger this vulnerability, the victim would need to open the malicious file
or access a malicious web page.

Subject: In the US v. Microsoft Supreme Court Case, an Old Law Leaves
  Few Good Options (WiReD)

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard oral argument in United States v.
Microsoft, a case that many observers believe could have significant
ramifications for how cloud computing and other technology companies
interact with the US government. If it were up to the justices themselves,
however, those implications would end up being short-lived.

The dispute concerns the reach of the Stored Communications Act, a 1986 law
that regulates the ability for the US government to obtain emails and other
communications from technology companies. In July 2016, the Second Circuit
Court of Appeals, a prominent federal appellate court that sits in New York,
ruled that a warrant obtained under the SCA does not allow the government to
require the production of emails stored by Microsoft overseas -- in this
case, on a server in Ireland -- because the relevant provision of the
statute does not apply *extraterritorially* to reach foreign-stored data.

Subject: Browser-based Cryptojacking (Eskandari et al.)

A first look at browser-based Cryptojacking
Shayan Eskandari, Andreas Leoutsarakos, Troy Mursch, Jeremy Clark
http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02887v1

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the recent trend towards in-browser
mining of cryptocurrencies; in particular, the mining of Monero through
Coinhive and similar code- bases. In this model, a user visiting a website
will download a JavaScript code that executes client-side in her browser,
mines a cryptocurrency, typically without her consent or knowledge, and pays
out the seigniorage to the website. Websites may consciously employ this as
an alternative or to supplement advertisement revenue, may offer premium
content in exchange for mining, or may be unwittingly serving the code as a
result of a breach (in which case the seigniorage is collected by the
attacker). The cryptocurrency Monero is preferred seemingly for its
unfriendliness to large-scale ASIC mining that would drive browser-based
efforts out of the market, as well as for its purported privacy features.

In this paper, we survey this landscape, conduct some measurements to
establish its prevalence and profitability, outline an ethical framework for
considering whether it should be classified as an attack or business
opportunity, and make suggestions for the detection, mitigation and/or
prevention of browser-based mining for non- consenting users.

Regarding your column about trackers for keeping track of everything (keys,

IoT industry seems intent on repeating the mistake made in developing the
early Internet: not including robust reliability/privacy/security. Horror
stories about exposures in lightbulbs, thermostats, baby monitors, and other
fancy gadgets show that this technology must be evaluated/adopted cautiously
and conservatively. Who knows how reliable/private/robust all the
devices/services you mentioned are? And what might risks be in revealing
people's/objects' locations?

Subject: Regulation of Internet Companies?!?

Haven't seen anything about this in RISKS so far this year, but recently
there have been calls from various people among the great and good claiming
that Internet companies (e.g., Apple, Facebook, Google, et al.) have become
too big and powerful so must be regulated.  This was a big topic at the
World Economic Forum meeting in Davos in January this year, and arguments
continue, for instance in two of todays' UK newspapers (March 12th):

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5489853/Tim-Berners-Lee-says-internet-weaponised-scale.html

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/03/11/london-mayor-sadiq-khan-tells-tech-giants-not-law/

Looks like lots of RISKS here; who decides what any regulations actually
say, and how to enforce them?  Different governments have different
criteria, so either there's going to have to be widespread international
agreement (seems unlikely), or the world is split into different regions
with different regulatory regimes (another Great Firewall of China?).

Of course some of the campaigning is from existing media businesses so
there's an element of vested interests here.  One line of argument is that
computer companies have effectively become utilities so should be regulated
like them, though as one commentator said, would you prefer your gas company
to be run like Google, or Google to be run like your gas company?  And then
there's the can of worms that is taxation...
