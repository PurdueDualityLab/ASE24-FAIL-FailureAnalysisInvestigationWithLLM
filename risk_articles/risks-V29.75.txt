[Australian news]

It's in the mail: how submarine secrets surfaced in Australia

In late April 2013 a Sydney postman reached into his satchel and pulled out
a small envelope containing the secrets of India's new submarine fleet. ...
This week the contents of that disk have become front-page news in
Australia, India and France as each country grapples with the ramifications
of an Edward Snowden-style leak of confidential documents disclosing the
entire secret combat capability of India's new Scorpene-class submarine
fleet.

Subject: Defense Science Board Summer Study on Autonomy

Last June the Defense Science Board released a study on the application of
autonomy to DoD missions.  The report is available at:
  https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&did=3D794641

The abstract reads as follows:

  At the request of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,
  Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&L)), the Defense Science Board (DSB)
  conducted a study on the applicability of autonomy to Department of
  Defense (DoD) missions. The study concluded that there are both
  substantial operational benefits and potential perils associated with the
  use of autonomy. Autonomy delivers significant military value, including
  opportunities to reduce the number of warfighters in harm's way, increase
  the quality and speed of decisions in time-critical operations, and enable
  new missions that would otherwise be impossible.  Autonomy is by no means
  new to the DoD. Fielded capabilities demonstrate ongoing progress in
  embedding autonomous functionality into systems, and many development
  programs already underway include an increasingly sophisticated use of
  autonomy. Autonomy also delivers significant value a diverse array of
  global markets. Both enabling technologies and commercial applications are
  advancing rapidly in response to market opportunities. Autonomy is
  becoming a ubiquitous enabling capability for products spanning a spectrum
  from expert advisory systems to autonomous vehicles. Commercial market
  forces are accelerating progress, providing opportunities for DoD to
  leverage the investments of others, while also providing substantial
  capabilities to potential adversaries. This study concluded that DoD must
  accelerate its exploitation of autonomy--both to realize the potential
  military value and to remain ahead of adversaries who also will exploit
  its operational benefits.

Samsung halted shipments of the device in the company's home country.
http://www.pcworld.com/article/3114766/android/samsung-halts-galaxy-note-7-shipments-after-reports-of-exploding-devices.html

In response to concerns over defective batteries prone to explosion, Samsung
has offered to exchange current Note 7 phones with a new Note 7 -- as early
as next week.  Current Note 7 owners can also immediately opt to exchange
their phones for a Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge and pocket the price difference.
Note 7 owners can also receive a $25 gift card or bill credit within the
exchange program. Go here for more details on Note 7 exchanges.

Later: Samsung issued an official statement on Friday regarding the Galaxy
Note 7. The company says it has halted sales of the phablet worldwide, and
that previously sold devices will be replaced *in the coming weeks.* The
company says that a battery cell issue resulted in 35 reported problems
worldwide with the Galaxy Note 7. Samsung's statement does not explain what

  When I rent a car, it's fun to get all the bells and whistles like
  navigation, hands-free calls and texts, streaming music and even web
  browsing. But did you know that cars with these features might keep your
  personal information, long after you've returned your rental car? Here are
  some things to keep in mind when renting a connected car.

  What happens when you rent a connected car? When you use the car's
  infotainment system, it may store personal information.  It may keep
  locations you entered in GPS or visited when travelling [sic] in the
  rental car -- like where you work or live.

  If you connect a mobile device, the car may also keep your mobile phone
  number, call and message logs, or even contacts and text messages. Unless
  you delete that data before you return the car, other people may view it,
  including future renters and rental car employees or even hackers.

Subject: Re: Half of people click anything sent to them (RISKS-29.74)

I'd like to suggest that this is evidence that counter-phishing training is
working astoundingly well.  We have constructed computer systems in which
clicking on things is how you get things done, in which clicking on things
is essential to both doing your job, watching cute cats, and becoming
outraged by the latest outrage.  (The wisdom of this design is subject to
debate, that we have designed things this way is not.)

The broad world trains people to click, and rewards them for doing so.
Cormac Herley, in "So Long, And No Thanks for the Externalities: The
Rational Rejection of Security Advice by Users" points out that "if users
spent even a minute a day reading URLs to avoid phishing, the cost (in terms
of user time) would be two orders of magnitude greater than all phishing
losses."

That counter-phishing training created a situation in which people didn't
click is an astounding achievement.  Of course, we could design technical
systems which detect that you that you've never before heard from this
correspondent, that you have never received email from their domain, that
the link goes to a domain you have never visited, and so reduce the need for
such training and the effort involved in evaluation.

>Extreme? Exaggerated? Valid? Can't tell.

A few minutes of googlage suggests that it's nonsense.  The article claims
that the alcohol made by the bacterium would kill all the plants on whose
roots it grew, because plants can't tolerate more than one 1 ppm of alcohol.
In fact the tolerance is all over the place and many plants including food
crops like maize (corn in the US) produce enzymes that can metabolize
alcohol.

We can certainly talk about the biological and legal issues that GMOs can
cause, but the anti-GMO crowd totally ignores the fact that GMOs have
concrete and well-documented benefits, notably less use of pesticides and
low-till farming to reduce soil erosion.  It's a trade-off, like most other
technical changes, and extremists on each side are utterly unhelpful.

  [Trade-offs are fine -- necessary to get anything done.  But pro-GMO crowd
  totally ignores arguments [*] in favor of labeling.  Sugar/fat/etc.
  content is shown on labels, why not GMOs, even given they're so far deemed
  benign?  I think resistance to labeling hinders acceptance.  Foods are
  labeled kosher, people don't resist them; try it for GMOs too.  Gabe
  Goldberg]

    [* They aren't arguments, they're assertions.  A lot of us think that
    the goal of GMO labeling is to scare people, not to inform them.  If
    there are indeed dangers to GMOs, they are better dealt with at the farm
    where issues like jumping to weeds can be addressed, not at the grocery
    store where they can't.

    How about if they said this: "this product contains genetically modified
    ingredients, which decades of research have shown to be safe to eat"

    That is at least true.  John Levine

    PS: I see a lot of potato chips and such that say in smallish type on
    the back that they contain GMOs, so you might be right that most people
    don't care.]

      [Argument is for right to know, regardless of safety -- separate from
      any assertions about non-safety. Realistically, resisting labeling
      supports conspiracy theories: if GMOs are so safe, why are they so
      militant about NOT labeling them; what are they hiding?

      I'm not arguing against GMOs; I don't know enough to have a position
      except that apparently they're currently deemed safe by most credible
      experts.  But I believe in label disclosures *and* that resisting
      labeling is counter-productive for acceptance.  Gabe Goldberg]

Deepwater Horizon: A Systems Analysis of the Macondo Disaster
Harvard University Press
Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England
September 2016
ISBN 978-0-674-54523-6

Book Foreword by PGN

This is an extraordinary book that digs deeply into the demise of the
Deepwater Horizon.  Readers are likely to be On Edge in every chapter.
Although this book is a factual account, it reads somewhat like a novel in
being such an unusually detailed, thorough, and authoritative analysis of a
disaster.  It also enumerates many realistic precautions, each of which
could have helped prevent the Macondo disaster.  In reality there was no one
weakest link; instead there were many weak links, and attention to them
could have avoided what happened.

The book is also unusual in the ways it explores the depth and breadth of
the causal factors that can be identified throughout -- involving many
layers of corporate and operational personnel, and multiple factors relating
to technology, management, standard practices that do not adequately cover
contingencies, and much more.  In this analysis of the Macondo case, these
factors are clearly multidimensional, multifaceted, widely distributed, and
crying out for the retrospective analysis that this book achieves.

Many lessons are here for everyone involved in the exploration and
production of oil and gas.  But much deeper, this book is an incisive
parable for almost everyone involved in risky endeavors, even in completely
different areas.  It stresses the importance of planning for disasters,
establishing detailed monitoring practices, carefully documenting
instructions for seemingly routine operations, and even more important,
carefully documenting changes in what must be done to anticipate and respond
to possible effects -- especially whenever the risks happen to be greatly
increasing in real time.  Even though it can be very difficult to
realistically assess dynamic changes in risks in real time, it is absolutely
essential.

The book's notion of the need to establish a pervasive and properly enforced
"safety culture" is very timely in a world that emphasizes cost reductions
and short-term optimization, to the deprecation of safety measures.  Many
organizations depending on life-critical systems might claim that they
already have a safety culture, but it requires much more than lip service --
it requires deep awareness of issues such as those considered here.

Furthermore, a similar observation also applies more generally to the need
for a culture of predictable dependability and trustworthiness, whether or
not human safety is a primary issue.  Many computer-related endeavors
require much greater reliability, resilience, security, privacy, and other
mission-critical desiderata.  In almost all disciplines, holistic thinking
that encompasses concerns such as those considered in this book -- and many
more -- is becoming a lost art.  The need for ubiquitous risk awareness and
risk avoidance (not just "risk management"), rigorous system practices,
preventive maintenance, and many other factors is increasingly being widely
ignored or given a much lower priority, typically in the quest for greater
profits.  As a consequence, the lessons of this book are enormously
important in most technologically based enterprises, and are vitally
compelling.
