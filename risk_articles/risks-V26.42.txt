Subject: Mark another security problem done and solved. Web login systems are flawless and here to stay.

It's been nearly ten years since the the USENIX Security [1] "cookie
eaters" paper [2] and the humor-less talk [3] that provided a secure
cookie authentication scheme and claimed to demonstrate weaknesses in
commercially deployed web login systems at places like the Wall Street
Journal [4].  Follow-up discussion appeared in a 2001 CACM Inside
Risks column [5].  I've finally decided to come clean; I'd like to
officially recant the 2001 USENIX Security paper for three reasons:
Web login systems are inherently flawless [6] and any problem is the
user's fault; no one has ever found any problems in a realistic
scenario [7], and the authors cannot possibly be real people.
Scientists occasionally publish erroneous results.

First, the problems were way overblown.  I mean, who even logs into web
sites today anyway?  Gopher and FTP have the most opportunity to gain
mind share; the Web is already saturated.  The New York Times [8]
recently followed suit with the WSJ paywall to install secure web
authentication systems.  It's flawless.  And if you really need extra
security, just use a two factor authentication dongle [9].  Or pick a
password like changeme123 [10].

Second, neither count thou two [11].

Third, the authors are not real. It turns out I had nothing to do with
this paper at all.  I mean, just look at the photo of those four kids
at USENIX Security [12].  Have you ever seen me wear tennis shoes and
jeans?  Clearly that should have been a tip off that some
Fu-doppelgänger was involved.  Nick [13] and Emil [14] might have been
duped, and Dan Wallach was certainly was a replicant.  I mean, look at
Dan [12].  He's wearing khakis.  There's no way that's really Dan [15]. 
And has anyone ever seen Kendra [16]?  Some think that she saw
our totems and tricked us into inception of this cookie authentication
fable.  For all we know, she probably joined the NSA!

Only a few years ago did I awake from my cryogenic suspension after
SCADA systems [17] for the local power substation failed.  In the
meantime, this Fu doppelgänger managed to build up my publication
record.  Thank goodness for Stuxnet [18] or I might never have woken.
Let me explain what happened.  After dabbling with Merkle trees in
file systems [19] in the late 1990s, I asked Ralph Merkle for a good
place for ice cream because Tosci's was closing at the MIT student
center [20].  But he misinterpreted and sent me to his cryogenic
chamber [21].  One you log in, you don't log out.  Upon thawing, I was
quite surprised to learn that Christof Paar and Ari Juels tricked my
doppelgänger into organizing a workshop on aphid security and privacy
[22].  The poor little bugs get such a bad wrap because they are so
tiny yet can damage the leaves of a Merkle tree.  If you are still
reading this, you must be depressed about the state of security of web
authentication and everything else---whether it's 2001 or 2010. 
April Fools!

	Cheers,
	Kevin
