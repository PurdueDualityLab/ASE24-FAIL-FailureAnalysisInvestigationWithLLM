Subject: Boeing's 737 Max Is a Saga of Capitalism Gone Awry (NYTimes)

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/sunday-review/boeing-737-max.html

"Yet in recent decades, Boeing -- like so many American corporations --
began shoveling money to investors and executives, while shortchanging its
employees and cutting costs."

Profit pressures undercut engineering process and problem solving culture in
a business that was a consumer product safety icon. FAA oversight capacity,
neutered by self-certification measures, accelerated product life cycle
completion with compromised safety.

Product safety, especially for software, and computer-based systems
generally, implies the institutionalization of effective defect escape
suppression mechanisms. Defects discovered earlier in a life cycle afford
more time to consider their repair prioritization BEFORE release for
sale. This practice assumes accountability for product life cycle process
fulfillment. If governance profit or schedule pressures force accountability
shirks, defects will free-flow to the customer.

Unlike the medical device industry, where device problem/patient problem
history is consolidated for public inspection by the FDA's MAUDE and TPLC
repositories, Boeing product defect escapes emerge via accident or mishap
investigations.

Justice Louis Brandeis said, "Sunlight is said to be the best of
disinfectants." Public visibility into Boeing's release and qualification
processes (test plans, test results, defects) should not be necessary or
required. Restoration of shattered public trust requires demonstrated
capability that overachieves both consumer expectations and flight safety
metrics.

Tesla has always prided itself on its so-called over-the-air updates,
pushing out new code automatically to fix bugs and add features. But one
security researcher has shown how vulnerabilities in the Tesla Model X's
keyless entry system allow a different sort of update: A hacker could
rewrite the firmware of a key fob via Bluetooth connection, lift an unlock
code from the fob, and use it to steal a Model X in just a matter of
minutes. [...]

From the archives: Say hello to the KGB software model that forecasted
mushroom clouds.

"Let's play Global Thermonuclear War."

Thirty-two years ago, just months after the release of the movie WarGames,
the world came the closest it ever has to nuclear Armageddon.  In the movie
version of a global near-death experience, a teenage hacker messing around
with an artificial intelligence program that just happened to control the
American nuclear missile force unleashes chaos.  In reality, a very
different computer program run by the Soviets fed growing paranoia about the
intentions of the United States, very nearly triggering a nuclear war.

https://techxplore.com/news/2020-11-robots-car-easy-lessons.html

"When we go into the world of cyber physical systems, like robots and
self-driving cars, where time is crucial, linear temporal logic becomes a
bit cumbersome, because it reasons about sequences of true/false values for
variables, while STL allows reasoning about physical signals."

STL == Signal Temporal Logic to accelerate AI training processes by enabling
discernment of correct v. incorrect outcome detection.

Achievement of driverless vehicle (DV) fleet deployments with guaranteed
accident and fatality reduction risk potential requires much more than a
technological solution.

A sustained transition from human-driver-in-the-loop supremacy to
DV-in-the-loop supremacy is required. This transition will be challenging
for drivers, both silicon and carbon-based, especially in the earliest
phases of widespread deployments.

DV hailing app terms of service may require passengers to indemnify the
fleet operator against class action suit in the event of accident subject to
fleet operator-sponsored arbitration, and mandatory acceptance of terms
before DV boarding commences. No acceptance, no ride.

NHTSA regulations appear to green light DV fleet deployment. If the federal
government generously underwrites an liability insurance pool, deployment
will accelerate.

The latest US motor vehicle traffic fatality statistics can be found here
https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813021
(retrieved on 20NOV2020). Whether or not STL, if integrated into the
dv-onics, can reduce these fatalities remains to be seen.

Subject: Looking for ways to prevent price collusion with AI systems
  (techxplore.com)

https://techxplore.com/news/2020-11-ways-price-collusion-ai.html

"AI systems have found, through learned experience, that uncommunicated
collusion can lead to higher profits. Such systems do not have to meet
secretly in back rooms -- instead, they use logic to discover that their
company will make more money if they charge more for products. And if all of
their competitors are using similar systems, they can all agree to raises
prices and hold them there, without ever having to actually agree to do
so. Worse, because they do not break any of the rules that have been
established to prevent human price setters from colluding, there is nothing
the law can do to stop them. At least not right now, based on current laws."

Price fixing enforcement (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_fixing)
requires access to pricing decisions.

A hypothetical PriceFixSnifferBot deployed by the Federal Trade Commission,
the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, or Securities Exchange Commission in
the US might deter commercial enterprises from illegally exploiting (gaming)
AI pricing systems.

Can a PriceFixSnifferBot correctly identify illegal price fixing traceable
to a non-communicated conspiracy of AI systems owned and operated by
commercial enterprises? It would imply continuous search of business pricing
systems across economic sectors.

A likely violation of the US Constitution's 4th amendment preventing illegal
search and seizure. Corporations, like people, are presumed innocent of
illegality until proven guilty. A nationwide search warrant to prevent
business price fixing across the economy? Reminiscent of a Philip K. Dick
story plot.

What might trigger a PriceFixSnifferBot to identify illegal price fixing?
The PriceSnifferBot would have to detect evidence of an algorithmic-enabled
pricing conspiracy. An algorithmic bias standard would be needed for it to
allege price bias.

The hypothetical algorithmic bias standard needs to equivalence the
international system of units established for kilogram, meter, second, or
ampere. These standards are fully dependent on the fundamental constants of
nature (pi, Planck's constant, electron charge, etc.).  Without this
universal reference, political influence might adjust PriceFixSnifferBot
deployment parameters to favor certain interests.

How to create an algorithm bias standard? Perhaps an analog computation, via
a Whetstone bridge circuit with precision resistor components, could
independently weigh a pricing system's algorithmic bias, thereby eliminating
the human thumb from the scale.

Not hard to imagine a PriceGougeBot available for off-the-shelf purchase, or
via open source at Git. Just-in-time to juice up the year-end holiday
shopping experience.

Subject: ML Guarantees Robots' Performance in Unknown Territory (Princeton)

Molly Sharlach, Princeton Engineering News, 17 Nov 2020
   via ACM TechNews, 23 Nov 20202

Princeton University researchers have developed a machine learning (ML)
technique for ensuring robots' safety and success in unfamiliar
environments. The researchers came up with the technique by adapting ML
frameworks from other fields to robotic movement and grasping. The new
technique was tested in various simulations, and also validated by
evaluating its use for obstacle avoidance using a small combination
quadcopter/fixed-wing airplane drone that flew down a 60-foot-long corridor
dotted with cardboard cylinders; it avoided those obstacles 90% of the time.
The Toyota Research Institute's Hongkai Dai said, " Over the last decade or
so, there's been a tremendous amount of excitement and progress around
machine learning in the context of robotics, primarily because it allows you
to handle rich sensory inputs," like images captured by a robot's camera.

Subject: Thunderbird 78+ OpenPGP is a mess

For years there has been a 3rd-party plugin for the Mozilla Thunderbird
email client, called Enigmail, that enables the use of GnuPG and OpenPGP
keyrings to sign and encrypt email.  It included a fairly complete key
management UI, and depended on an installation of the Windows port of
OpenPGP.  This meant I could have a single keyring and share it between
Windows, Thunderbird and Cygwin.

With version 78, the folks at Mozilla made Enigmail obsolete (and
non-functional), replacing it with built-in OpenPGP integration.  Sounds
good, right? Wrong! The new implementation is extremely limited compared to
Enigmail, but it has a couple of major flaws. One is inconvenient, but the
other is a security hole big enough to drive a train through.

With Enigmail, every time you wanted to sign an outgoing message, you were
required to type in the key's passphrase.  There may have been an option to
cache the passphrase for a few minutes, I didn't use it, but I have a dim
memory of the timeout being quite short.

Thunderbird's OpenPGP integration does things differently.  First, it uses
its own internal keyring.  No more sharing a single keyring among different
OpenPGP implementations.  Highly inconvenient as I now have to manage two
identical keyrings.

The real problem is in passphrase management.  When you import a private
key, Thunderbird asks for your passphrase *and stores it*.  From that point
forward, it does not prompt for the passphrase when using it to sign an
outgoing email.  They claim the encryption used for the passphrases is
"safe".

There's another feature called "Master Password", but that's just security
veneer as it is requested only once, at session startup. Most people leave
their email client running in the background continuously.  Anyone with
physical access to the machine can now impersonate you with ease.  And then
there's the use case of a shared computer.  If you want PGP encryption
without the glaring risk, you cannot use Thunderbird.

I went to the Mozilla bug database to see what others have said. There are
several bugs filed, all closed and dismissed with comments like "Just lock
your computer. Problem solved".  I filed my own bug
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1679455

We'll see what happens.

Subject: A "moral contract" with a virus?

Quebec premier Francois Legault has promised a sort of four day "visiting
period" December 24th to 27th over Christmas, if les Quebecois will behave
themselves nicely in the week before and after.
http://newsletters.cbc.ca/c/1e0JJjHQpUTXDnsEwMZFgBCttS4

This proposition is so bizarre it makes my head spin.  It is akin to the
saying that expecting the world to treat you nicely because you are a good
person is like expecting a bull not to charge you because you are a
vegetarian.  Yes, I know that we all have COVID fatigue, and that mental
health is an issue, but thinking that you can make this kind of deal with a
virus reveals a profound misunderstanding of the situation.

The pandemic risk is not this type of risk.  You can't make deals with it.
It won't agree not to attack you on Tuesday if you behave properly today.
You have to isolate, you have to wash your hands, you have to keep
physically distant, and you have to wear a mask if you aren't physically
distant ALL THE TIME.  Or, if you are in close contact with someone who is
infected (even if neither you nor they know it) you will get sick.  You
don't get to do deals.  You don't get to not wash your hands just because
you, personally, find wearing a mask more difficult than you think other
people do.

Look, putting it in infosec terms, you don't get to click on *that*
dangerous link, safely, just because you have *not* clicked on three
dangerous links previously.  If you click on the link, you are going to get
the drive-by download installed on your machine, and the blackhats are going
to steal all your financial information, contacts, and accounts.  You have
to keep up your guard ALL THE TIME.

With this type of thinking, I am *not* looking forward to the coming months.
The US is already in a bad way, and American Thanksgiving is coming up next
week, right?  Take a lesson from us, in Canada.  We let our guard down for
*our* Thanksgiving, which is in October (at the actual harvest season, not
just a kickoff for Christmas shopping season), and we are *definitely*
paying for it now.  If those of you in the Unexplored Southern Area party on
Thanksgiving and then again at Christmas, there won't be any of you left by
the time the vaccines actually come out.

Look, this isn't the virus that stole Christmas.  Think of other ways to
"get together," separately.  That's why God invented Zoom and Whatsapp and
Facetime.  (And Jit.si.  I'm dying to try out Jit.si.  Somebody just
installed it on our Vancouver Security SIG Slack.)  (I hate Slack.)  I'm
pretty sure you can find someone on Doordash who will deliver turkey.  But
don't think of packing together in a house this Christmas.  It's dangerous.
And no "moral contract" will change that.

Now go call your Mum on Whatsapp.

<https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:506291-2020:TEXT:EN:HTML&src=0>"
posted to the European Union public procurement tracker Tenders Electronic
Daily states that the U.K.'s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency plans to deploy "an Artificial Intelligence (AI) software tool" to
"process the expected high volume of COVID-19 vaccine Adverse Drug Reaction
(ADRs) and ensure that no details from the ADRs' reaction text are missed."

"It is not possible to retrofit the MHRA's legacy systems to handle the
volume of ADRs that will be generated by a COVID-19 vaccine," the contract
notice continues. "Therefore, if the MHRA does not implement the AI tool, it
will be unable to process these ADRs effectively.

"This will hinder [the MHRA's] ability to rapidly identify any potential
safety issues with the COVID-19 vaccine and represents a direct threat to
patient life and public health."

The contract, which is worth $2 million, was awarded in September to
Genpact (UK) Ltd. The posted announcement states that "reasons of extreme
urgency" related to the pandemic have "accelerated the sourcing and
implementation of a vaccine specific AI tool."

COVID vaccine safety expected to be 'similar to other types of vaccines' [...]

Subject: Nice solution to password problem -- if only

Please note: We are using a passwordless system to manage Snopes
Accounts. This means we'll email you a verification code each time you log
in.  If you do not receive your verification code within a few minutes of
logging in, please check your spam folder.

We're using a passwordless login system for a few key reasons:

1. It's momore secure. With a username and password system, users tend to
choose a password they're comfortable with (such as their birthday or pet's
n name) or credentials they've used for other accounts. As a result, if
hackers get access to one account, they can gain access to many, leading to
a *domino effect* that can put all of your information at risk. A
passwordless system removes this threat.

2. It's simpler. Since your Snopes account will be tied to your email, you
won't need to remember complicated passwords or periodically renew your
password to keep your information safe. All you'll need to do is remember
the email address associated with your account to log in.

3. It's becoming the norm. Many other industry leaders are moving towards
passwordless login systems for both reasons above, so it very well may soon
be used by other websites you frequent.

https://www.snopes.com/faq/what-is-passwordless-login-and-why-does-snopes-use-it/

  [What could go wrong with that?  So having your email compromised
  automatically compromises every site using this system, what a great time
  saver.  GG]

  and Get Paid (Atlas Obscura)

``We are satisfied with little, but even that little is impossible today.''

When Captain Alexander Ovchinnikov took over command of the ship Gobustan in
Istanbul, the term COVID-19 hadn't been coined yet, quarantine was was the
stuff of apocalyptic science fiction, and few people outside of China knew
where Wuhan was. It was December 25, 2019.  Ovchinnikov, 39, was still on
that ship through the summer, along with 11 other crew members: The second
engineer was Russian too, the cook was Ukranian, and the rest were from
Azerbaijan. At least one had been on board since October 2019, and none of
them had received a salary since January. The crew of Gobustan had been
stuck since June 16 in the Italian port of Ravenna, on the Adriatic Sea.
``We live like in prison.  We get up, have breakfast, do some routine
activities, then we have dinner and go to bed,'' said Ovchinnikov. Their
days were all the same and the stillness was shaken only by cleaning and
maintenance activities. Sure enough, the ship was clean as a whistle.

I do not agree its conclusion. While I agree that passwords should be
complex and long, rather passphrases, and ideally go along with second
factor authentication, the problem in the below lies somewhere else: in the
increasing need to register with an email address / password combination to
even the simplest webpages to get some random content (newsletters, bulletin
boards, etc.) such that the website owners can market those email
addresses. The risk of exposure of personal information, if those sites are
compromized, on that pages is zero. The password complexity (and use of 2FA)
should be proportional to the risk --- where PII is at stake, complex
passwords & 2FA are a must. But for a page where I am forced to register
just with an email address to access content, like RISKS, any password can
do.

And this points out why one should *NEVER* use a so-called "password
manager" because they are inherently untrustworthy and have access to all
your passwords.

If you want to publish all your passwords for everyone to see, why not just
write them on a sticky-note and stick it on your window, or send it as a
letter to the editor of your local newspaper?  Or post them on Twitter or
whatever the kids are using these days ...

Subject: Utah monolith: Internet sleuths got there, but its origins are
  still a mystery (BBC News)

It took just 48 hours for the first person to get there.

When officials in Utah on Monday revealed they had found a shimmering, metal
structure deep in the Red Rock desert, they refused to say exactly where.

They hoped that would be enough to deter amateur adventurers from setting
off to find it, risking getting dangerously lost in the process.

But there was little chance that people would abide by this advice. By
Wednesday, pictures were emerging on Instagram of people triumphantly posing
with the monolith, eager to show the world that they had got there first -
even if the wider mystery of why it is there remains unsolved.

They were aided by Internet sleuths who had quickly geo-located the
structure on Google Earth and posted the co-ordinates online.
