Subject: The Crypto[currency] World Can't Wait for Ethereum's Merge
 (NYTimes)

A long-awaited upgrade to Ethereum, the most popular crypto[currency]
platform, may make the technology more environmentally sustainable. But it
comes with risks.

The cryptocurrency industry has endured a terrible year. A devastating crash
wiped nearly $1 trillion from the market, draining the savings of thousands
of people. Several companies filed for bankruptcy.

Now the industry is fixated on a potential saving grace: a long-awaited
software upgrade to the most popular cryptocurrency platform, Ethereum,
which provides the technological backbone for thousands of crypto-projects.
The upgrade -- known as the Merge -- has gained near-mythical status after
years of delays that left some insiders questioning whether it would ever
happen.

But if all goes according to plan, the Merge will take place around 15 Sep
2022, more than eight years after it was initially discussed. The change
would shift Ethereum to a more energy-efficient infrastructure, addressing
the widespread criticism that crypto[currency]'s climate impact outweighs
its possible benefits. And it would lay the foundation for future upgrades
to reduce the hefty fees required to conduct transactions in Ether, the
platform's signature currency and the second-most valuable digital asset
after Bitcoin.

Subject: 5G Networks Are Worryingly Hackable

Edd Gent, *IEEE Spectrum*, 24 Aug 2022, via ACM TechNews, 26 Aug 2022

German security researchers determined 5G networks can be hacked, having
breached and hijacked live networks in a series of "red teaming" exercises.
Poorly configured cloud technology made the exploits possible, they said,
and Karsten Nohl at Germany's Security Research Labs cited a failure to
implement basic cloud security. He suggested telecommunications companies
may be taking shortcuts that could prevent 5G networks' "containers" from
functioning properly. The emergence of 5G has escalated demand for
virtualization, especially for radio access networks that link end-user
devices to the network core. Nohl said 5G networks respond to the greater
complexity with more automated network management, which makes exploitation
easier.

Subject: The next wave of wireless security worries: API-driven IoT devices

Wireless carriers may be the next cast of characters to learn the hard way
about the security risks created by IoT devices. This warning came in a
recent briefing
<https://www.blackhat.com/us-22/briefings/schedule/#attacks-from-a-new-front-door-in-g--g-mobile-networks-26971>
at the Black Hat information-security conference
<https://www.blackhat.com/us-22/briefings/schedule/> here by Altaf Shaik, a
senior security researcher at Technische Universit=C3=A4t Berlin.

"There is increased threat when it comes to 5G, and the impact is also
quite bigger because here the hacker gets to target the industry and not
just a single user," Shaik said at the start of this 40-minute presentation.
<https://i.blackhat.com/USA-22/Wednesday/US-22-Shaik-Attacks-From-a-New-Front-Door-in-4G-5G-Mobile-Networks.pdf>

The core issue here is 5G's utility in connecting not just people (who stand
to get notable privacy upgrades with 5G, as Shaik explored in a presentation
at last year's Black Hat conference
<https://www.lightreading.com/security/5g-defends-against-imsi-catchers---but-implementation-is-critical/d/d-id/771471>)
but machines. Carriers are now moving to turn that latter feature into new
lines of business
<https://www.lightreading.com/iot/t-mobile-venture-aims-to-bring-uncarrier-simplicity-to-enterprise-iot/d/d-id/775451>
by offering IoT services to businesses that these customers can manage
directly through new APIs.

"For the first time, 4G and 5G networks are trying to bring this network
exposure," Shaik said. "The proprietary interfaces are now changing and
slowly moving to generalized or commoditized technologies like APIs."

"So now any external entity can actually control their smart devices by
using the service APIs and going through the 4G or 5G core network," Shaik
said, citing a Vodafone test of drones in Germany. "This exposure layer
provides APIs and shares information for the drone control center."

Carriers sell these IoT services to businesses (as verified with a tax ID)
willing to buy IoT SIMs in bulk purchases of a thousand or more. These
business customers, in turn, can manage these SIMs through an IoT
connectivity management web interface, with an IoT service platform web
interface providing account-wide controls.

"You can do plenty of stuff, provided you have access to these APIs,"
summed up Shaik.

Open to compromise

However, poorly configured or administered APIs can open the IoT devices of
other customers and even perhaps a carrier's core network to compromise.
For example, an attacker could start by exploiting vulnerabilities "to gain
data of arbitrary users hosted on the same platform," then attempt to
compromise a carrier's application server -- and then possibly "penetrate
from there into the mobile core network, because they are connected," Shaik
continued. [...]

Subject: Eight-Year-Old Linux Kernel Vulnerability Uncovered
 (Ravie Lakshmanan)

Ravie Lakshmanan, *The Hacker News*, 22 Aug 2022, via ACM Tech News

Northwestern University researchers have discovered an eight-year-old
vulnerability in the Linux kernel, dubbed DirtyCred, that exploits a
previous unknown flaw to escalate user privileges to their maximum. The
researchers described DirtyCred as "a kernel exploitation concept that swaps
unprivileged kernel credentials with privileged ones to escalate
privilege. Instead of overwriting any critical data fields on kernel heap,
DirtyCred abuses the heap memory reuse mechanism to get privileged." They
added that it "is like the dirty pipe that could bypass all the kernel
protections, [but] our exploitation method could even demonstrate the
ability to escape the container actively that Dirty Pipe is not capable of."

Subject: Experimental Attack Can Steal Data from Air-Gapped Computers
 (Carly Page)

Carly Page, *TechCrunch*, 24 Aug 2022, via ACM TechNews, August 26, 2022

Security researcher Mordechai Guri at Israel's Ben Gurion University
identified an experimental exploit for stealing data from
Internet-disconnected computers. Guri said the Gairoscope attack uses a
smartphone's gyroscope to exfiltrate information from air-gapped computers
just "a few meters away." He said an attacker monitoring sounds emanating
from the speakers of the air-gapped system could gain data like passwords or
login credentials. Guri said these inaudible frequencies generate "tiny
mechanical oscillations within the smartphone's gyroscope," which can be
rendered as readable data. In addition, he said, attackers could conduct the
exploit using a mobile browser, since phone gyroscopes can be accessed using
JavaScript. Suggested countermeasures include removing loudspeakers from
air-gapped systems to create an audio-less networking environment, and
screening resonant frequencies produced by the audio hardware through an
audio filter.

The offer to military veterans left unemployed by the coronavirus pandemic

from app development to graphic design.

Schedules were disorganized and courses did not follow a set syllabus.
School-provided laptops couldn't run critical software. And during long

Weaponizing Censorship Infrastructure

Reflective amplification attacks are a powerful tool in the arsenal of a
DDoS attacker, but to date have almost exclusively targeted UDP-based
protocols. In this paper, we demonstrate that non-trivial TCP-based
amplification is possible and can be orders of magnitude more effective than
well-known UDP-based amplification. By taking advantage of TCP-noncompliance
in network middleboxes, we show that attackers can induce middleboxes to
respond and amplify network traffic. With the novel application of a recent
genetic algorithm, we discover and maximize the efficacy of new TCP-based
reflective amplification attacks, and present several packet sequences that
cause network middleboxes to respond with substantially more packets than we
send. We scanned the entire IPv4 Internet to measure how many IP addresses
permit reflected amplification.  We find hundreds of thousands of IP
addresses that offer amplification factors greater than 100×. Through our
Internet-wide measurements, we explore several open questions regarding DoS
attacks, including the root cause of so-called mega amplifiers. We also
report on network phenomena that causes some of the TCP-based attacks to be
so effective as to technically have infinite amplification factor (after the
attacker sends a constant number of bytes, the reflector generates traffic
indefinitely). We have made our code publicly available.

While not an attack directly on TCP, it has been shown there is a way to
conduct source address-spoofed TCP-based amplification and reflection
attacks with relatively little effort.  The problem is not in TCP itself,
but in how middle boxes maintain TCP state for the end points between
boundaries, or don't maintain state as is the case here.  Most attacks are
mostly now found in the larger tweaks.

For those that haven't seen this paper, it is worth a look, and may result
in a lot of "I told you so's" for those who have been skeptical of middle
boxes.   :-)

Subject: Keeping Up With the Vacuum Cleaners

I tell people that everyone fights about which field of technology is
changing the fastest.  I don't fight about it.  I figure security has a
lock on it.  Regardless of what else changes in whatever other field of
technology, it has an implication for security.

We need to keep up.

We need to keep up with each change in technology.  We need to keep up with
the vulnerabilities that are being created as people create more
"solutions."  We need to keep up with the latest threats; the latest
exploits; the latest attacks; the latest news about who has been attacked,
and how.  We have to pursue the news avidly, and effectively, to try and
keep up with the most relevant issues of the day.

There are of course people who try to produce newsletters to help us out.
Well, sometimes not to help us out.  Vendors, and trade rags, frequently
produce such newsletters themselves.  Unfortunately, since their aim is to
promote their own products, they put minimal work, and pretty much no
analysis, into retailing whatever stories they consider to have security
implications.

There are, however, some useful ones.  The oldest, and preeminent, one is
the RISKS-Forum Digest. ( http://www.risks.org ) It's contributors make up
the cream of the cream of those who are interested in the dangers of
technology, and to technology.  And Peter, over thirty-five years, has set
the standard for the moderation of a quality topical mailing list on the
Internet.

The Department of Homeland Security used to produce one.  It's ceased
publication on January 27th, 2016.  Odd, that.

Another one is put out by the Security Branch of the office of the Chief
information officer, of the province of British Columbia.
<http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/information-security/security-news-digest>
It's pretty good.  And it has been running for long enough to develop a
track record that I can use to say that.

Les Bell has recently started one
<https://www.lesbell.com.au/classroom/blog/index.php?courseid=1>.  He's got
a background in trade media, but, unlike most of the editors and writers in
trade rags, he also knows the field of security.

In a recent version of the newsletter
<https://www.lesbell.com.au/classroom/blog/index.php?entryid=63>, he talked
about the fact that Amazon has purchased iRobot, the maker of the Roomba
vacuum cleaner.  Les noted that Amazon makes a number of home IoT devices.
Amazon can collect a great deal of information from the devices in your
home.  But one thing the devices can't do, is map your home.  Until now.
The Roomba is built to map your home, in order to make its vacuuming more
efficient.  So now, in addition to all the other data that Amazon is able to
collect, it is able to look inside your home, in a sense.

Les doesn't go any farther than that.  I don't think he goes quite far
enough.  Because iRobot doesn't just make vacuum cleaners.  They also make
robots for the military, and law enforcement.  And, now that all of this is
under one roof, so to speak, Amazon will be able to sell a service to law
enforcement.

When law enforcement once to do a raid, they would dearly love to know what
they will face once they get inside the door.  Well, if a Roomba is in the
house, Amazon will be able to provide them with that information.
Amazon/iRobot will be able to tell you the layout of the rooms, and where
furniture is, and (possibly not in real time, but) where people are likely
to be.  I'm sure that law enforcement will be willing to pay for such
information.  After all, it will be a saving of lives to do it.  Not just
police officers, but the occupants of the house, who will be in less danger,
given that the police have more information about where they are.

More and more companies are getting more and more information about you.
Some of this information is helpful, both to you, and the authorities.  Some
of the information is just useful to the authorities.  And some of the
information is going to be useless, and even misleading, and mistakes will
be made.

[2205.11916] Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners,
  Takeshi Kojima et al.
https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916

If you feed a machine-learning language model "reasoning" questions,
it gets some right and some wrong.  Depending on the model and how
it was "trained." If you give the same question to the model but add
"Let's think step by step", it gets them right.

Apparently the magic phrase depends on the kind of model, and the kinds of
training.  What phrase could we use on humans, to encourage them to reason
in additional ways?

Clearly it would have to be different for different native languages and
cultures, and for different desired methods of coming to a conclusion; e.g.,
"Love thy neighbor as thyself" might potentiate some results and "Let's make
America/France/Russia great again" might produce others.

(This reminds me of Max Barry's fine science fiction thriller, Lexicon.  In
it, people are classified into "segments" -- for each segment, a different
sequence of nonsense words will force the person to obey orders.)

Subject: Danger: Metaverse Ahead! -- Part 2

Different vendors, and different commentators, seem to have different ideas
about the nature of the Metaverse.  (It's difficult to opine about a
technology when nobody can agree on what that technology actually is.)
 However, all seem to agree that the metaverse will involve some kind of
artificial reality.

Artificial reality or virtual reality will provide the interface to the
metaverse, in the opinion of most.  Virtual or artificial reality will
provide a layer of abstraction, hiding the nuts and bolts of what is going
on in terms of communication and processing, from the user.

As has been famously said, any technical problem can be solved by the
addition of a layer of abstraction, except for the problem of too many
layers of abstraction.

Anytime you hide something in information processing, you are in grave
danger of introducing some kind of security vulnerability.

We will be hiding, from the user, who or what they are actually talking to,
in terms of machine and network connections.  We will be hiding, from the
user, any idea of where processing is taking place.  There will be a lot of
processing involved in creating the virtual or artificial reality itself.
Is this processing taking place on the user's machine?  Is this processing
taking place on the host platform machine?  Is this processing taking place
somewhere else in the cloud?  And then there's the question of what this
processing is actually doing and how realistic, or consistent, the
presentation to the user actually is.

There are going to be differences in devices that users use to access the
metaverse.  We are already seeing inconsistencies and differences in
communications devices, and the representations that they make of our
communications.

For example, Gloria and the girls and I tended to communicate via
WhatsApp.  WhatsApp has a number of communications functions, but we used
it primarily for text messaging.  When I wanted to indicate a joke, being
old school, I would use the standard text-based emoticons: generally
speaking a colon, a hyphen, and a close parenthesis.  And now comes the
first question about where processing takes place.  When I typed in those
three characters, something, either the soft keyboard that I was using, or
WhatsApp itself, would change it to a graphic emoticon, for transmission.
I don't know, for sure, which piece of software did that translation.  (I
suspected it was WhatsApp, because the soft keyboard did seem to work
differently with other programs.)  In any case the others would see a
little happy face icon.  However, Gloria, using an Android device, what
often see the little Android character, bearing a smile.  The girls, using
iPhones, would generally see the more usual yellow happy face icon.  The
three of us would see three different representations of what I had typed.
That is a minor inconsistency, and probably would not lead to any great
misunderstandings.  But it is an inconsistency.  It is a difference.  A
layer of abstraction has been added, and other people do not know,
accurately, what it is that I actually did or said.

Now multiply that by an extensive range of devices from handheld
smartphones to vision systems and sensing gloves.  Multiply that from input
via text, or speech recognition.  Multiply that by speech recognition using
artificial intelligence.  Multiply that by graphical representation
systems, that are possibly also using artificial intelligence to both
generate, and represent, communications.  The possibilities for mixed
representation expand enormously.

Misrepresentation or inaccuracy is not the only possible problem of
abstraction.

A number of issues can be hidden from the user and may threaten the
security of both the user and the metaverse system itself.

Communication protocols, and authentication procedures and protocols, will
also be hidden from the user.  Many issues and many security factors will
be abstracted and therefore hidden from the user.  This abstraction will
add layers of complexity to an already extremely complicated security
situation.  Authentication will become much more important.  The protocols
of communication, and authentication, will be hidden from the user.  They
will be hidden in layers of abstraction that will add complexity to an
already complex mix of communications protocols, networking protocols,
middleware applications, and authentication.

The Metaverse, like the world wide Web before it, will attempt to become a
grand unified field theory of the Internet.  Everyone will want their
application to work in the Metaverse.  Everyone will want their business to
function in the Metaverse.  Banking, finance, business transactions, and
even real real estate sales, will take place in the Metaverse.  E-commerce
will be apart of the metaverse, and will be one of the major drivers.
Therefore, authentication will become even more important.

Authentication will have greater significance.  At the moment, most
authentication for many e-commerce functions will operate on the basis of
some kind of cookie left on the machine.  This is node authentication, in a
way.  But node authentication will be insufficient in a situation where the
bulk of commerce is being done on the Metaverse, and individuals must be
identified, authenticated, and their authorization verified.
Authentication will become much more complex, and, at the same time,
attempts will be made to make authentication simpler for the user and more
transparent.  The user will not want to remember passwords or pull out
tokens to verify themselves.  Users are already used to the node
authentication that places a cookie on their machine so that their banking,
purchasing, online shopping, games, and other entertainments are all
instantly accessible when they sit down at the computer, or when they pull
out their smartphone.  They will not want a more complex system to verify
themselves to the Metaverse.

The grand unification of communications and authentication, under the
Metaverse, will add complexity, to an already complex environment.  And, of
course, complexity is the enemy of security.  Therefore there will be many
aspects of the Internet of the metaverse that will be extremely complex
with layers of abstractions, authentications and communications protocols
that must all be verified, and must all work properly together.

If the Metaverse is to be a universal interface to the Internet, and all
forms of communication, there will be issues of compatibility.  We are
already seeing a variety of problems in this regard, with the existing
Internet, and the World Wide Web.  Websites are being programmed in such a
way that they will display on any device, screen, or window.  But in order
to do this, the displays can be significantly different.  Indeed, in many
situations, certain functions will not appear on the wrong sized device,
screen, or window.  Certain websites can demonstrate this fairly easily
simply by resizing an existing window very slightly.

Thus, in the name of compatibility, we have sites that can display
completely differently to different users.  This can create enormous
misunderstandings when users are, apparently, using the same website, and
see completely different things.  At the very least, it is an enormous
problem for technical support.  With the automation of web development, and
the inclusion of application programming interfaces, and functional
libraries, and point-and-click and cut and paste programming/citizen
programming, these differences may not even be apparent to the system's
managers, or owners.  Those charged with technical support may be
completely unaware of the lack of functionality that different users will
see depending upon their device, screen, or window size.

With such differences in our existing Web interfaces, how much greater will
be the problems when we are dealing with the Metaverse, and devices ranging
from three-dimensional artificial reality goggles, to simple smartphones.

Subject: Dangers of the Metaverse -- Part 2b - "White voice?"

I posted my piece on the Metaverse and misrepresentation, and got an
interesting URL in response:

https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/sanas-startup-creates-american-voice-17382771.php

... which is about a "service" that lets call centre workers use technology
to make themselves sound "white."

They had fun with the idea:

> The solution, though, is pretty simple and should satisfy everyone: let
the caller choose the accent they want to hear right at the start of the
call. I mean, maybe you'd love to hear the IRS with a Jamaican accent, just
to keep your mood up? Or Swedish chef?

> Even better, let the caller decide how the help desk hears his or her own
voice, like a sexy French accent or irate Irish, depending on the
circumstances.

> Also, letting white people change their voice to not sound so white could
also be a big deal going forward.

... but, particularly in regard to the Metaverse, this leads nicely into the
area that I *really* wanted to get into (and that a request to examine got
me started on all of this), which is psychological factors (and dangers) of
the Metaverse.  Of which the "echo chamber" is definitely one.

I suspect that there are significantly more dangers involved in this
offering than are immediately apparent.  This service, or product, or
whatever we want to call it (and we should probably be careful to call it by
family friendly, or at least printable, names), is an example of the echo
chamber effect that social media seems to be concentrating on in very many
cases.  The echo chamber is, of course, the ability to talk only to those
who agree with you and whom you agree with. This has significant dangers in
the existing social media world, and this can only be exacerbated as the
Metaverse comes into reality.  We talk to people whom we think agree with us
on a variety of issues, and we assume that they are like us in appearance,
social status, economic status, and a number of other areas as well.
(However, as the article points out, this type of deception is being done
anyway, even without technology, by those who train themselves to speak with
American accents.  See Judi Dench's character's new job in "The Best Exotic
Marigold Hotel.")  There are two dangers inherent in this practice that
cannot be easily addressed: people who assume, supported by the fact that
everyone they talk to agrees with them, that *everyone* agrees with them;
and the fact that people will assume that people who agree with them on one
topic will agree with them on other topics, and therefore create problems
and offend the people that they are talking to by raising offensive ideas
that the other person *doesn't* agree with.  (There are, of course, many
more specific examples that can be imagined: these two only illustrate the
two major sides of the echo chamber coin.)

The company and investors, of course, present the idea in the most laudable
terms: reducing bias.  But, as the article points out, accents don't *cause*
bias, they just trigger it.  This is like treating the symptom, and not the
underlying disease.  (Recently I had exercise induced vasculitis.  The
doctor I saw was very concerned that I *not* attempt to get steroid cream to
apply to it, which would possibly reduce irritation and itching, but would
weaken the tissues, and possibly cause more serious problems.)

In terms of the putative service call, a problem is that some white
supremacist will think that he's talking to a fellow racist and say, in the
course of the conversation, "I'm glad I'm not talking to one of those
[offensive racial epithetic which just happens to apply to the person he's
actually talking to].  Two immediately obvious problem possibilities arise.
The first is, why should your staff be subject to such offensive comments?
The second is that your service people may be offended enough to respond in
kind to the person making offensive comments (probably to the total surprise
of the racist who made the comments), and therefore generating bad will and
bad reputation for your company.

(In terms of this service as a business offering, I also suspect that many
more people would be offended by the generated "white" voice than by
accents.  It will probably be quite a while before the service can operate
with the speed, and the timbre, necessary to make it sound truly human.
Until then, callers who don't know the service is being used will hear
delays, and a fairly flat delivery, and assume they are talking to some kind
of voice response system.  The "uncanny valley" effect will probably kick
in, and people will be annoyed at talking to, as they think, a robot.)

But the jokes also point out some dangers.  If you, and the person you are
talking to, are friends, know about the technology, and know that it is
being used, then, yes, it's fun.  In any other situation, then, like I said
in the original posting, it creates an opportunity for misrepresentation,
and therefore can *cause* misunderstandings, far from eliminating them.  I
recently had to deal with a communications problem with multiple parties,
where a number of those involved had become offended.  It was, of course, a
situation requiring delicate negotiations.  I would *not* want Irish
imprecations added to any of my communications with any of the parties
involved.  Nor would I want any musical lilt added to my delivery, lest
those causing the problems see it as less serious than it was.

Subject: Re: Startup uses AI to transform call center workers' accents into
 "white voice" (RISKS-33.41)

Article: Have you seen the 2018 movie Sorry to Bother You? It's about a
young black man who gets a job at a call center and has trouble making sales
until he adopts a "white voice."

A new company called Sanas seems to have based its business plan on the
movie. It has developed software that converts call center workers' accents
into "standard American English." If you listen to Sanas' demo, it sounds
remarkably like the white voice in Sorry to Bother You.

Not only that, but if you're listening to your laptop audio through
headphones or earbuds, presumably that wouldn't be audible enough to cause
the crash. Suppressing frequencies from the audio output would punish those
users for no practical reason.
