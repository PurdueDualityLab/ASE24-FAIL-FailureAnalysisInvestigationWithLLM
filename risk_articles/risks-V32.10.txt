Subject: Judge denies Harris County TX request to allow email voting
  for those infected with COVID-19 (Zach Despart, Houston Chronicle)

<https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Harris-County-seeks-email-voting-COVID-patients-15399796.php>

It seems as if the only recourse is to have all of the people infected with
COVID-19 get paper ballots on the basis of disability, make sure to sneeze
and cough thoroughly all over the the ballots and the envelopes (which they
should lick with their infected tongues), and then have their nurses mail
them in.  Those who can't get paper ballots should demand to be wheeled into
the polling stations on their sickbeds (with ventilators in tow) where they
can sneeze and cough all over everyone there. Then, after tens of thousands
of people get sick and thousands of people die, they or their estates can
sue the State for damages.

Why aren't there any cartoonists depicting this nonsense? Have even the
cartoonists given up?

  [Dan Wallach, Rebecca Mercuri, and I testified before the Houston City
  Council on 9-10 July 2001, where we maintained that the intended voting
  machines Harris County was about to acquire were nowhere near secure
  enough.  Not much has changed technologically since then, other than the
  names of the purveyors.  Overall, the voting machines are just rebranded
  snake oil, and the non-technological problems (biased redistricting,
  massive disenfranchisement, creative disinformation, etc.) are apparently
  endless.  PGN]

Subject: Why Some Birds Are Likely To Hit Buildings (Scientific American)

https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/why-some-birds-are-likely-to-hit-buildings/

"By understanding which birds are more likely to collide with buildings,
researchers can perhaps determine the best way to modify buildings, or their
lighting, to help prevent such accidents. And by knowing risks along with
migration timing and behavior, building managers can better anticipate when
birds are at their greatest danger—and modify lighting strategies
accordingly."

Birds unfortunately strike moving targets. "The number of wildlife strikes
reported per year to the FAA increased steadily from about 1,800 in 1990 to
16,000 in 2018." https://wildlife.faa.gov/home operates database to report
wildlife strikes against air vehicles.

Do aircraft need a BCAS -- Bird Collision Avoidance System to supplement the
avionics suite?

https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/by_the_numbers/ states ~44,000 daily tracked
flights (pre-pandemic): 44,000 flights/day * 365 days/year ~= 16.1M annual
flights/year.

16,000 strikes/year / 16,100,000 flights/year = .000996 * 100% ~= 0.1% (1
per 1000) strike probability per flight.

Several comp.risks contributions cite bird strikes, e.g.:

Subject: Microsoft Warns of a 17-Year-Old 'Wormable' Bug (WiReD)

The SigRed vulnerability exists in Windows DNS, used by practically every
small and medium-sized organization in the world.

Subject: Risk management

So, people have lost jobs, friends, family members, life as they know it,
and lives.

And the authorities are telling people, *begging* people, to stay apart, and
stay inside, and stay away from crowds.

So, what does Krispy Kreme (in New South Wales, Australia) do to aid things
in this situation?  They have a free donut giveaway, to celebrate their 83rd
birthday.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-14/coronavirus-fears-over-krispy-kreme-
doughnut-promotion/12454862

And people came out and crowded the stores.  For a dozen free donuts.

The promotion was a success.

If you think drawing big crowds, in this environment, is a success ...

  Stealing Intellectual Capital (RISKS-32.09)

Is there a lawyer in the audience?  The presented text snippet out of an
EULA begs the questions, isn't causing damages by negligence a criminal
offense?  And, can a contract contain a clause which exempts one side from
responsibility for criminal offenses it may commit?

I was reminded of Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon, 1973.

  [This is a highly praised novel of potential interest to RISKS readers.
