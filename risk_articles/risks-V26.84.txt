Subject: City Misses $1.6M in Parking Tickets Because of Computer Glitch

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Thousands of first coast drivers are just now getting
parking tickets from years ago.

Last week, Lisa Crawford received a $63 bill for an unpaid $20 parking
ticket - dated September 2011.

"It was very frightening because it said it could impound my car, and I look
at September and I'm like, oh my God I'm on borrowed time," Crawford said.

The notice Crawford received from the City of Jacksonville's collection
agency was one of 24,000 sent out in the past few weeks, according to the
city's public parking officer Jack Shad.

Crawford's bill was a tiny part of $1.6 million in fines the city hadn't
reported to the collection agency because they didn't realize they were
missing. ...

Sarah Clark, 8 May 2012

JOHNSON COUNTY, Kan. - Oh, the joys of making a trip to the DMV, or the
motor vehicle offices, as they're called in Kansas.

Drivers in Johnson County, Kan., were turned away after a computer glitch
forced offices to close on Tuesday. A message on the Johnson County
government website read:

"The Johnson County Motor Vehicle Offices located at 782 N. Ridgeview Road
in Olathe and 6000 Lamar in Mission are closed due to technical issues with
the new MOVRS computer system, Tuesday, May 8."

Other offices in Kansas outside of Johnson County remained open.

Tuesday was the first day for the new motor vehicle system after a week-long
shutdown of all Kansas Vehicle Offices. FOX 4 talked to taxpayers on Tuesday
who feel the upgrade is not making it easier to get licenses and
registrations.

Several people waited for more than two hours on Tuesday as they tried to
renew a license or get a car registered. Daniel Corney says he was told he'd
have to wait over three hours to register his motorcycle. ...

Phil Yacuboski and WBAL-TV, 15 May 2012

Four students at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County got a free
ride, according to a state audit released Tuesday.  "A student received a
refund but had not been charged tuition for that semester," said Bruce
Myers, legislative auditor.

The errors are the result of a computer glitch.

The audit, conducted between 2008 and 2011, showed that one student was not
charged up to $8,000 in tuition and fees, but that same student also got a
financial aid refund of more than $10,000.  A second UMBC student got almost
$10,000 in financial aid and never had to pay tuition and fees. ...

KODIAK, Alaska (AP, 1 May 2012) - A computer glitch has resulted in
incomplete totals from data submitted online by Sitka blacktail deer hunters
around Alaska, according to state officials.

The Kodiak Daily Mirror says that hunter Joseph Mauer of Kodiak was

Mauer said he had already submitted his data at the end of last season using
the department's new online harvest reporting system for deer. ...

RALEIGH, N.C. - The Division of Employment Security website has been down
since late Thursday, locking out those who log on to update their benefits.

Spokesman Larry Parker said the division's web and phone services were
offline as the result of a mainframe problem, but that people could update
their files by visiting a local DES office. However, visits and calls to
offices in Raleigh, Smithfield, Durham and Cary showed computers there were
offline as well.

"They said everything was down all across the state," said Kwame Manigault.
He was trying to update his banking information at the Raleigh DES office.

JetBlue officials scrambling this morning to cover their tracks as the story
rattles around the globe. ...

Officials confirmed an 18-month-old girl was mistakenly pulled off a JetBlue

JetBlue representative told the family their toddler was on the federal list

On Thursday, JetBlue said a computer glitch caused the confusion and their
employees were simply doing their jobs. The U.S. Transportation Security

  ``This strategy 2 and 3 grew so large that it became obvious to other

This is a classic example of hubris in assuming we can triumph over risk by

  Judge Michel seemed unaware of the depth of the software industry's
  dissatisfaction with the patent system. He suggested the patent system's
  critics were relatively marginal figures not representative of the views
  of the broader technology industry. And he didn't seem to understand the
  dynamics of the patent arms race currently affecting the software
  industry.  "If software is less dependent on patents, fine then. Let
  software use patents less as they choose," Michel said.  "If other
  industries are terribly dependent on patents, then let's not wreck the
  system just because software people are unhappy."

On balance, I'd ditch software patents from the system in a heartbeat.

Somini Sengupta, *The New York Times* Blogs, 11 May 2012

How does Facebook use all the words, pictures and clicks of its 901 million
users?

A group of European college students first raised that question last
year. The Irish Data Protection Office, which regulates all of Facebook's
European data policies, took it up. On Friday, Facebook shared a bit more.

"We're adding more examples and detailed explanations to help you understand
our policies," Facebook's new chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, a veteran
privacy lawyer in Washington, wrote, in a blog post.  Facebook users can
give feedback and talk to Ms. Egan on Monday in a video chat.

The new explanations, available by clicking on the Help tab on the bottom of
the Facebook home page, include one on how cookies work on the site and what
information application developers receive when you download an app on the
Facebook platform. The explanations also inform users about who can see what
kinds of posts on their timelines. ...

Ernesto, TorrentFreak, 13 May 2012 [via Dave Farber's IP]
http://torrentfreak.com/microsoft-funded-startup-aims-to-kill-bittorrent-traffic-120513/

The Russian based Pirate Pay startup is promising the entertainment
industry a pirate-free future. With help from Microsoft, the developers
have built a system that claims to track and shut down the distribution of
copyrighted works on BitTorrent. Their first project, carried out in
collaboration with Walt Disney Studios and Sony Pictures, successfully
stopped tens of thousands of downloads.

Hollywood, software giants and the major music labels see BitTorrent as one
of the largest threats to their business.

Billions in revenue are lost each year, they claim. But not for long if the
Russian based startup Pirate Pay has its way. The company has developed a
technology which allows them to attack existing BitTorrent swarms, making it
impossible for people to share files.

The idea started three years ago when the developers were building a
traffic management solution for Internet providers. The technology worked
well. It was able to stop BitTorrent traffic if needed, which made the
developers realize that they might have built the holy anti-piracy grail.

``After creating the prototype, we realized we could more generally prevent
files from being downloaded, which meant that the program had great promise
in combatting the spread of pirated content,'' Pirate Pay CEO Andrei Klimenko
says. ...

Swanni, Washington, D.C. (15 May 2012) -- Comcast has filed for a patent
for a new technology that would force viewers to watch ads even when they
try to skip them on their Digital Video Recorders.

That's according to an article by FierceCable.

The cable operator's move is in sharp contrast to Dish Network's new Auto
Hop DVR feature that allows viewers to watch recorded shows on the four
major broadcast networks without ever seeing a commercial.  Network
executives blasted Dish's new feature yesterday, but the satcaster said it
wants to "champion" the interests of subscribers, not advertisers or

Subject: Software Engineer: 2012's Top Job (Cindy Waxer)

Cindy Waxer, *InformationWeek*, 15 May 2012, via ACM TechNews

A recent CareerCast.com study ranked software engineer as the top job for
2012 based on five criteria, including salary, stress levels, hiring
outlook, physical demands, and work environment.  Software engineer ranked
higher than doctor, Web developer, computer programmer, and financial
planner due to tremendous demand and outstanding salary.  The U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics recently found that the median pay for software engineers
was $90,530 per year in 2010.  In addition, the demand for software
engineers is on the rise, with an estimated growth rate of 30 percent
between 2010 and 2020.  "Over the last few years there's definitely been a
20 percent to 25 percent uptick in salary for software engineers," says
Monetate's Tom Janofsky.  "I feel like I live in a different economy.  We're
constantly hiring."  Other benefits for software engineers are
collaboration, creative thinking, and hands-on experimentation that can
support a career in a continuous state of evolution.  Software engineers
also enjoy a lot of flextime, interesting colleagues, and a collaborative,
team-oriented work environment.  "A lot of what we do is about failing,
doing something wrong, and then going back and looking at the problem
again," Janofsky says.

make it difficult (if not impossible) for the doctor to allow a relative to
received or review the patient files, even and especially if the person

"regardless of watt hours"? What about the tiny batteries inside hearing aids?
A quick search found various lithium batteries with usual nominal 3 volt
rating and a capacity of just 15 mAh: these are used extensively in "blinkies"
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinky_%28novelty%29
15 mAh at 3 volts is 0.045 watt hours, or 162 Joules or 40 calories
(0.04 food Calories).

This is enough energy to raise the temperature of 1Kg of water by 0.04
degrees C, or equivalently to raise the temperature of 10g of water by 4
degrees C.

And this is supposed to bring down an airplane?

About as likely as being able to do so with a 110 mL tube of toothpaste!

In RISKS-26.83, a note is forwarded from/via Steve Greenwald about a sailing

The GPS car navigation systems I've seen all exaggerate the widths of roads

Those elections assume everyone is registered and votes. Blank or protest
votes are easy to control, but it takes no special knowledge or access, is
easy to spot, and rarely escapes notice whenever a US voting district counts
a few thousand more votes than it has registered voters.

The real problem here is that when a district with say, 300 registered
voters, tallies 3,000 votes for the candidate who wins, elections officials
are not required to do anything at all except to state that the "computer
glitch" was harmless and did not change the results of the election.
