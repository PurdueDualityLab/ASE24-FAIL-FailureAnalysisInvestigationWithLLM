Subject:  Online voting is too vulnerable (The Economist)

Why voting online is not the way to hold an election in a pandemic:
It is still too vulnerable to cyber-attacks and security breaches.

Subject: No-password Access to Britain's Road Surveillance Camera Data
  (The Register)

Travel involving nearly nine million cars in Britain was accessible merely
by typing the system's IP address into a browser:

Subject: Democratising mass surveillance, one snafu at a time (The Register)

Exclusive In a blunder described as "astonishing and worrying," Sheffield
City Council's automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR) system exposed to
the Internet 8.6 million records of road journeys made by thousands of
people, The Register can reveal.

The ANPR camera system's internal management dashboard could be accessed by
simply entering its IP address into a web browser. No login details or
authentication of any sort was needed to view and search the live system â€“
which logs where and when vehicles, identified by their number plates,
travel through Sheffield's road network.

Britain's Surveillance Camera Commissioner Tony Porter described the
security lapse as "both astonishing and worrying," and demanded a full probe
into the snafu.

Subject: Washington Post-University of Maryland poll finds a problem for
  Apple-Google coronavirus app (WashPost)

Nearly 3 in 5 Americans say they are either unable or unwilling to use the
infection-alert apps under development by Google and Apple, suggesting a
steep climb to win enough adoption of the technology to make it effective
against the coronavirus pandemic, a Washington Post-University of Maryland
poll finds. [...]

A major source of skepticism about the infection-tracing app is distrust of
Google, Apple and tech companies generally, with a majority expressing
doubts about whether they would protect the privacy of health data. A 57
percent majority of smartphone users report having a `great deal' or a `good
amount' of trust in public health agencies and 56 percent trust
universities. That compares with 47 percent who trust health insurance
companies and 43 percent who trust tech companies like Google and Apple.

Subject: Malicious Android apps (WiReD)

Malicious Android apps from the so-called PhantomLance campaign targeted
hundreds of users, and at least two slipped past Google's defenses.

Connected kitchen gadgets are supposed to streamline cooking, but this one
just gave me a headache.

Disney claimed that it owned "Maythe4th" and all *your* posts that use it.

Subject: Re: 'No evidence' that recovering from Covid-19 gives people immunity,
  WHO says (RISKS-31.74)

There have been a number of reports and suggestions that people who have
had COVID-19 may not have immunity.  They are usually accompanied by
statements that we need a vaccine.  Of course, a vaccine just tricks the
immune system into developing antibodies by exposing it to parts
of/attenuated/dead the virus in question.  However, if being infected with
the virus does not create immunity, this makes developing an effective
vaccine very difficult if not impossible.

  [One of these days we will consider the risks of computer viruses and
  coronaviruses in complementary context -- for example, relating to the
  soundness of models and predictions, theory vs practice, belief systems,
  misinformation, disinformation, etc.  Many useful comparisons might seem
  relevant here, in case any readers are wondering why there are so many
  COVID items in RISKS lately!  PGN]
