Subject: Tesla faces new probes into motorbike deaths, false
 advertising (Ars Technica)

NHTSA is investigating bike deaths as California says Tesla statements are
"untrue."

The first fatal crash occurred in the early hours of July 7 in Riverside,
California, when a Tesla Model Y on State Route 91 hit a motorcycle from
behind, killing its rider. The second fatal motorcycle crash occurred on
July 24, again at night, this time on I-15 outside Draper, Utah. In that
case, a Tesla Model 3 was driving behind a motorcycle and hit it, killing
the rider.

Subject: Cisco Confirms It's Been Hacked by Yanluowang Ransomware Gang
 (The Hacker News)

Networking equipment major Cisco on Wednesday confirmed it was the victim of
a cyberattack on May 24, 2022 after the attackers got hold of an employee's
personal Google account that contained passwords synced from their web
browser.

"Initial access to the Cisco VPN was achieved via the successful compromise
of a Cisco employee's personal Google account," Cisco Talos said in a
detailed write-up.  "The user had enabled password syncing via Google Chrome
and had stored their Cisco credentials in their browser, enabling that
information to synchronize to their Google account."
<https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/08/recent-cyber-attack.html>

The disclosure comes as cybercriminal actors associated with the Yanluowang
ransomware gang published a list of files from the breach to their data leak
site on August 10.
<https://twitter.com/Cyberknow20/status/1557419082210676736>

The exfiltrated information, according to Talos, included the contents of a
Box cloud storage folder that was associated with the compromised employee's
account and is not believed to have included any valuable data.

Besides the credential theft, there was also an additional element of
phishing wherein the adversary resorted to methods like *vishing* (aka voice
phishing) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) fatigue to trick the victim
into providing access to the VPN client. [...]

Subject: A Sydney high school banned mobile phones. It had dramatic results
 (Sydney Morning Herald)

Andrew Taylor, *Sydney Morning Herald*, 7 Aug 2022

  A Sydney high school has seen a dramatic decrease in behavioural issues
  and a boost in physical activity and students talking to each other just
  two months after it tightened restrictions on mobile phone usage.

  Davidson High School principal David Rule said there had been significant
  changes since students in years 7 to 10 were banned from using mobile
  phones at school.  "Classrooms have effectively become phone-free and this
  has allowed staff to focus on educating students," he said in a school
  newsletter. "Finally, in eight weeks of the policy, there has been a 90
  per cent reduction in behavioural issues related to phones in the school."

  The high school in Frenchs Forest requires students to put phones in a
  pouch that, once closed, cannot be reopened without breaking a lock.

 (Attack of the 50-Foot Blockchain)

Transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are completely traceable. Any
transaction anyone ever made on Ethereum can be traced, all the way back to
the launch of the project in 2015. Transactions are pseudonymous â but many
users have been identified after the fact.

Tornado Cash is a mixer â an Ethereum smart contract program that you can
use to break the traceability of transactions on Ethereum. This is for
privacy.

Tornado Cash accepts deposits of ether (the currency on Ethereum) from one
address and enables you to withdraw the ether from a different address. The
smart contract works as a pool that mixes all deposits, using zero-knowledge
proofs.

If the ether is proceeds from a crime, then this is literally just money
laundering.

Tornado Cash was also used heavily by North Koreaâs Lazarus Group to launder
stolen ether and help the country get hard currency.

In what should come as no surprise to anyone whatsoever, Tornado Cash has
been sanctioned by the US Office of Foreign Asset Control.

discussions to stay truly private need to be as ephemeral as possible.
Since I'm already getting queries about this, let me put it this way.  With
the demise of Roe, we have entered a new era. My view is that to stay truly
private discussions need to be as ephemeral as possible.  Many
communications don't need that level of privacy. For them, use whatever you
feel comfortable with. But voice calls through conventional carriers are
still pretty much the most ephemeral of communications compared with
everything else. Yes, voice calls could be recorded. Yes,r they're just
data. But the laws regarding wiretaps are significantly stronger (and much
older) compared with how more "modern" communications are handled. While an
anti-abortion state might get a search warrant for emails, texts, posts,
even entire phones, they are unlikely to get a search warrant for past phone
calls -- since those usually will not exist as they are not routinely
recorded en masse. Obviously once a wiretap order is placed by a court, that
changes. But by and large, the most ephemeral communications still are, in
my opinion, ordinary voice phone calls through the conventional
carriers. And again, that is just my opinion.

Subject: New Data Suggests Our Fundamental Model of the Universe Is Wrong,
 And Scientists Are Racing to Solve It (dnyuz)

We live in a strange universe filled with unexplained phenomena that have
perplexed humans since time immemorial. Scientists have pieced together a
rough guide to the cosmos -- known as the Lambda cold dark matter model, or
more simply, the standard model of cosmology -- but many mysteries don't
seem to fit into this otherwise well-corroborated framework, especially as
our view of space has gotten ever more precise in recent years.

Scientists are now especially preoccupied with intractable tensions that
have emerged from different measurements of two cosmic properties: The rate
at which our universe is expanding, known as the Hubble constant (Ho), and a
value called sigma-8, which describes variations in how matter clumps
together across large cosmic scales.

Efforts to measure these properties in space have puzzlingly returned
different values. When the Hubble constant is measured based on observations
of brilliant stars that act as yardsticks in space, its speed is clocked as
about 50,400 miles per hour per million light years. However, when it is
measured using the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the oldest light in
the universe, it is 46,200 miles per hour per million light years.
Meanwhile, the value of sigma-8 is different when measured using the CMB,
compared to other observational techniques.

What this means, essentially, is that there may be a potentially serious
flaw in our basic understanding of the universe and the fabric of reality.
In response, scientists around the world are now trying to resolve these
tensions.  [...]

Subject: Danger: Metaverse Ahead!

No, I'm not talking about the latest excuse for plot contortions in the
Marvel studios movie franchises.

We are being told to prepare for the Metaverse.  We are being told that the
Metaverse is coming.  Facebook, indeed, has changed its name to Meta, the
better to cash in on the Metaverse.  Whenever it arrives.  Or to create it,
and sell it to us.

What is the Metaverse?  Well, it seems to be a sort of virtual reality
interface to, well, who knows?  Social media in general?  A social media
platform, in the same mode as Facebook?  But with avatars?  (Instead of
faces?)

(Today I saw an article about an artificial intelligence program to turn
your image, into an avatar, that looks something, not completely dissimilar
to, but not really like, you.)

It's all very meta.

We are already being sold the Metaverse.  Perhaps not quite for cold hard
cash, quite yet, but we are being prepared for heavy duty sales pitches as
soon as somebody comes up with an acceptable platform.

(Maybe that will be a bit of protection for us.  None of the existing social
media giants, or indeed technical giants, want somebody else to be the
Metaverse.  As long as they are fighting about it, we are safe from it.
Well, relatively safe.  I'm sure they'll still try to sell us little bits of
it.)

Why should you be concerned?  Well let me start off with a different
question: why would you need it?  As analyst, pundit, and social commentator
Neil Postman has said, what is the problem to which this technology is the
solution?

But, all right.  Let me address the question of why you should be concerned.
They are going to sell you the Metaverse.  Or, they are going to sell you
little bits of it.  They are already starting to sell Metaverse "real
estate."  Even the phrase "Metaverse real estate" is misleading.  Metaverse
real estate is completely unreal.  In the real world real estate has real
value because it's real.  And because you need it.  To have a place to live,
or a place to work, or a place to build a factory, or a place to build roads
to get goods from one factory to another, or from a factory to the homes.
As Mark Twain famously said, buy land, they are not making any more.  (Well,
except for the Dutch, of course.)

Metaverse real estate isn't real.  When they want to sell you more Metaverse
real estate, they just make it.  And it's easy to make.  Because it's not
real.  It's all just ones and zeros.  They are selling you nothing.

Speaking of selling you nothing, the Metaverse will probably be using
cryptocurrencies.  And NFTs.  And using decentralized finance (or defi, for
short).  Remember cryptocurrencies?  That system where you pay in real
money, to buy cryptocurrency, with no inherent value of its own, because the
people who have created the cryptocurrency are telling you that many people
will want to buy cryptocurrency, and you will be able to get real money out
of the system, because of the new people, who come in after you, and pay
real money, to buy cryptocurrencies with no inherent value.  Your return,
and the inflation on your investment, depends upon the new people who come
in after you and pay real money to buy in.  You will be paid from the money
that they deposit.

Didn't someone named Charles Ponzi invent something similar a while back?

Metaverse real estate is not the only unreal thing that the vendors of the
Metaverse will want you to pay real money for.  If you want a house on the
unreal real estate, they will sell you an unreal house.  If you want
artworks in your unreal house they will sell you unreal artworks (at unreal
prices).  (But charge you real money.)

The vendors will sell you entertainments.  These entertainments will be
popular.  Even if you are the only one attending.  It's easy to create a
whole bunch of avatars, filling a theater, and creating a whole bunch of
applause.  Pre-recorded applause.  The vendors will sell you games.  The
vendors will sell you opportunities to interact with your friends.  The same
friends that you can interact with now for free.  Or possibly new friends.
Who may or may not be real.

The vendors may sell you opportunities to work, and therefore make money.
It'll probably be in cryptocurrency, but they'll probably sell you the
opportunity to convert it to real money as well.  (For a reasonable fee.)
The opportunities to work will probably be real.  You will probably have
real clients or real employers, so that they can pay you the real money.
But they'll charge a reasonable fee for the opportunity to get that work.
Of course, "reasonable" will be defined by the vendors.

It may be that, in the Metaverse, you need to make life bearable, or more
enjoyable.  What's a thneed?  I have no idea.  I'm borrowing Dr Seuss's
term.  But I'm sure that the vendors of the Metaverse will find one, or make
one, or imagine one, and convince everybody that they need one.

Still don't think that there are dangers in the Metaverse?

Subject: Re: Bad Batches

Having an MD (and throwing a lot of numbers around) does not imply
competence in research design or statistical analysis.  [The founder of the
website] does not appear to have factored out even the most obvious
covariants, such as age.  The initial batches of vaccines were restricted to
healthcare workers and people aged 75 and older (remarkably, that is 5.9% of
the population -- compare that with his 5% of the batches, etc.), who would
have more co-morbidities, a greater chance of dying and possibly a greater
tendency to react adversely to vaccines. There is nothing in the VAERS data
that indicates whether the death/disability/reaction was in fact due to the
vaccine – that has to be demonstrated via careful analysis.  Because the
batches are strongly time-dependent, the analysis must include factoring out
other time-dependent covariants.  For example, Moderna batch 041L20A, which
has the highest ADR of all the Moderna batches, and among the highest for
Deaths and Disabilities, was administered very early (I got it in January
2021, and reported my adverse reaction to VAERS in February).  Another
obvious time-dependent covariant is the version of the virus that was active
at the time of vaccination (since the vaccines do NOT PREVENT either
infection or deaths -- they simply reduce the probability, *all other things
being equal*).  Yet another time-dependent factor is that covid is a very
different sort of infection, and there has been a long learning curve on the
part of health-care providers in how best to treat it, so that the
death-rate early on (with or without vaccination) was in part due to lack of
appropriate/effective treatment (and again, no vaccine PREVENTS death).  I
do not deny that some people have severe adverse reactions to vaccines -- I
am one of them.  And there may indeed be some variability in batch
effectiveness and reactivity potential -- but I'd be willing to bet that it
is much smaller than this guy asserts.

I do not understand why anyone is objecting to continued implementation of
leap-seconds.  Well more than a half-century ago, I worked on software that
handled leap-seconds without any problems.  That was before the protocol was
implemented to use whole seconds.  Instead, fractional leap-seconds occurred
several times a year.

To simplify things, the protocol was changed in 1972 to use only whole
leap-seconds.  Furthermore, the preferred occurrence of leap-seconds was set
for either the end of 30 June or the end of 31 December, with additional
opportunities -- only if really necessary -- at the end of 31 March and 30
September.

The software where all this worked well was used by the U.S. Air Force to
operate its constellation of earth-orbiting space satellites.  To avoid
timing ambiguities, the software used TAI internally.  TAI is invariant,
without leap-seconds.  Time was kept in terms of seconds elapsed since some
adjustable base instant.  In some cases, time had to be resolved to the
nearest millisecond.  For external use, TAI was converted to UTC or
vice-versa via a few very simple subroutines.

If key operations required UTC, the Air Force was alerted to pending
leap-seconds.  No such operations were scheduled within a few minutes before
or after the scheduled occurrence of a leap-second.

The software system involved was operational well beyond its expected
lifetime, more than 20 years.  It was replaced by a new system created by
system engineers, programmers, and coders who had no knowledge of
leap-seconds -- until the go-to guy for issues of time and earth rotation
(me) asked the simple question: "How do you handle leap-seconds?"

I just toured training facility at Inova, huge health system in Northern
Virginia. The robotic pharmacist medicines dispenser has been improved to
require typing THREE (not ONE) characters to begin selecting a drug from
pulldown list. I'd heard years ago from a nurse friend that it was all too
easy to type a letter, get the list, and miss clicking the desired
selection. At least with three characters it's a bit more reliable. Plus,
when drugs are administered, they're scanned and patient is scanned to
ensure it's right med for right patient.

I had my gall bladder out almost 30 years ago. Surgeon said he'd do
it laparoscopically. Surgeon friend said no matter intent and promise, he
might have to open. My surgeon agreed -- but said in something like 5,000
procedures he'd never had to open. Plus, I think, he'd been involved in
developing the laparoscopic procedure.

I just toured training facility at Inova, huge health system in Northern
Virginia, had a chance to drive Da Vinci surgical robot. Now I understand
much better the advantages it has -- improved/magnified visibility of work
area, flexibility working inside small incisions vs. needing larger
incisions, precise motions. I' m not comparing its risks to open procedure
-- just noting impressive technology.

I was definitely told many years ago that IBM shipped some of their machines
sold as 8-bit pathways with 16-bit paths that could be upgraded by removing
a jumper. Can't remember the model numbers (and it might have been 16/32 --
it was a very long time ago).

When I attempted to buy this book or get it at the library, I learned that
the actual title is "The Winning Ticket: Uncovering America's Biggest
Lottery Scam", and the actual author is Rob Sand, or rather, Rob Sand with
Reid Forgrave.
