    20.83, 23.24, and/or 25.07?

[2] still wear a wristwatch instead of using a cellphone or something

[3] have the kind that needs to be set back a day because (unlike the

    to March 1?

and

[4] *hadn't realized it yet*?

Me, I remembered around 11:50 pm, but could do nothing about it then -- and
didn't remember *again* until nearly 12 hours later.

The Voting News Weekly is a service of the Verified Voting Foundation.
  [This long, well documented, and extremely informative item has been
  truncated for RISKS.  VVF is an extremely worthy organization devoted to
  election integrity.  PGN]

Computerworld reported on discussions of Internet voting at the RSA computer
security conference. Doug Chapin observed that while the latest felony voter
fraud stunt (this time in New Mexico) was possible in was nevertheless still
wrong. PolitiFact Florida determined that Stephen Colbert's observation that
shark attacks are more common than voter fraud was "mostly true." Advocates
for Latino voting rights criticized redistricting maps drawn by a Federal
court. The majority Tory Party in Canada was implicated in robocall scheme
aimed at suppressing voter turnout in Ontario. With all genuine opposition
to the Supreme Council banished, different conservative factions vied in
Iran's Presidential election, while Vladimir Putin is expected to win
re-election in an election widely perceived by many Russians and outside
observers as unfair and Senegal is headed for a run-off after no candidates
received a majority of the vote in their Presidential election.

Internet voting systems too insecure, researcher warns

  "Internet voting systems are inherently insecure and should not be allowed

  RSA Conference 2012 being held here this week.  David Jefferson, a
  computer scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories and
  chairman of the election watchdog group Verified Voting, called on
  election officials around the country to drop plans to allow an estimated
  3.5 million voters to cast their ballots over the Internet in this year's
  general elections."  http://j.mp/yHJ2nU  (Computerworld)

Subject: First enforcement action under HITECH Breach Notification Rule

Thanks to Deborah Peel of PatientPrivacyRights.org [PGN-ed]

The Office of Civil Rights in the Dept of Health and Human Services (OCR)
slapped the wrist of BCBS of Tennessee.  One million people's protected
health information was breached because Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) of
Tennessee violated data security laws. The fine cost BCBS a little more than
$1.00 per person -- hardly a deterrent to other corporations or adequate
punishment.  However, that is the highest possible fine permitted by law
(HITECH).  But criminal charges could have been filed for "willful
disregard". OCR's finding that legally-required "adequate administrative and
physical safeguards" were lacking is evidence of "willful neglect".

Worst of all, the one million victims received NO protection against future
ID theft or medical ID theft. *OCR could have also required BCBS to
mitigate future patient harms, but didn't*. New technologies can protect
against medical ID theft by enabling patients to review all new claims, so
they can detect and prevent fraudulent claims and erroneous data from being
entered into their records.

Why didn't OCR propose that BCBS adopt remedies to protect the patients
whose records were breached from further misuse and theft?  Shouldn't OCR
help protect victims?

Subject: The Hidden Risk of a Meltdown in the Cloud

*Technology Review* 13 Mar 2012, via ACM TechNews, Wednesday, March 14, 2012

Despite the rising popularity of cloud-based computing, the risks of a
full-scale cloud migration have yet to be properly explored, says Yale
University professor Bryan Ford.  He notes that in the worst-case scenario,
a cloud could experience a full meltdown that could seriously threaten any
business that relies on it.  "This simplistic example might be unlikely to
occur in exactly this form on real systems--or might be quickly detected and
'fixed' during development and testing--but it suggests a general risk,"
Ford says.  He notes, for example, that a lack of transparency between
different cloud providers could lead to conflicting internal control loop
cycles.  "Non-transparent layering structures ... may create unexpected and
potentially catastrophic failure correlations, reminiscent of financial
industry crashes," Ford warns.  A more general risk occurs when systems are
complex because unrelated parts become intertwined in unexpected ways.  He
notes that only recently have industry experts begun to realize that bizarre
and unpredictable behavior often occurs in systems consisting of networks of
networks.  "We should study [these unrecognized risks] before our
socioeconomic fabric becomes inextricably dependent on a convenient but
potentially unstable computing model," Ford says.

level domains.  *IT Business*, 29 Feb 2012

opening text:

The shutdown of a Canadian billionaire's online gambling Web site shows the
U.S. government is willing to assert its legal authority over Internet
properties outside American boundaries -- even those based in Canada, a
Toronto domain name registrar warns.

Saskatchewan-born Calvin Ayre, 50, and three of his associates were charged
Tuesday with allegedly operating an online gambling site, a practice
outlawed in the U.S. in 2006. The charges were filed in a federal court in
Maryland.

The case raises questions about Internet sovereignty because U.S. officials
were able to take the site, Bodog.com, off the Net even though it's owned by
a Canadian and operated out of various offices overseas.

A new plan from the British government will use closed-circuit television

drivers from filling up their gas tanks -- that is, until their vehicle
information has been logged in the system.  *The Mirror* reports that the
plan is meant to address the 1.4 million uninsured motorists in Britain and
act as a deterrent. That may not sound like a huge number compared with the

It is an important topic! It has much more worrying consequences than
people's and vehicles' movements being tracked by third parties.

The UK's Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng) published a report a year ago
on the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure to Global Navigation
Satellite System (GNSS) disruptions. GNSS is a generic term for systems of
which GPS is one, GLONASS another and Galileo to be a third.

The Committee that produced the report was chaired by Martyn Thomas (MT),
who contributes regularly to RISKS (RISKS). The news got rather lost; it was
headlined in the United Kingdom (UK) the day before the Tohoku earthquake
(Martyn's 15 minutes of fame on the front page of the British Broadcasting
Corporation's (BBC) World-Wide Web (WWW) site :-) )

Martyn recently (7 Feb 2012) gave a Keynote talk on the topic to the 20th
Safety-Critical Systems Symposium (SSS'12) in Bristol, which was filmed by
the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) for its archives. I find
Martyn a very entertaining as well as informative speaker, and I encourage
people to look at the film.

Unfortunately you can't necessarily see Google previews of all the content

Subject: Inside the Stratfor Attack (via Dave Farber's IP)

Nicole Perlroth, 12 Mar 2012

Last December, a group of hackers quietly orchestrated an attack on Stratfor
Global Intelligence Service, a company based in Austin, Tex., that analyzes
geopolitical risk and publishes a newsletter for various clients, among them
the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense. The hackers breached the
company's network and, once inside, confided in their fellow hacker, Hector
Xavier Monsegur, and, as it turns out, the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Six months earlier, in June, the F.B.I. had arrested Mr. Monsegur and
turned him into an informant. With his help, four hackers in Britain
and Ireland were charged last Tuesday with computer crimes; a fifth
man was arrested Monday in Chicago. Using the information he passed
along, F.B.I. officials said it was able to thwart attacks on roughly
300 private companies and government agencies.

But with Stratfor, they were not so lucky. ...

Maybe I'm too cynical and have lived too long on this planet.

Again, my sincere apologies to Peter and RISKS readers for the initial post.
