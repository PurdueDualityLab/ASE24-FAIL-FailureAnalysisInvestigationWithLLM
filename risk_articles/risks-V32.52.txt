Subject: DC Vaccine Appointment Website, Phone Line Crashes Early Thursday
  (DCist)

The District's phone and online system crashed on Thursday morning just as
thousands of residents became newly eligible to sign up for 4,350
appointments for the COVID-19 vaccine.

Mayor Muriel Bowser said this week that appointments would open at 9 a.m. to
residents living in priority ZIP codes who are 65 or older, are 18 and older
and have a qualifying medical condition ranging from asthma to cancer, or
work in a number of essential jobs from child care to grocery stores.

But the demand almost immediately overwhelmed the city's online and phone
system, with many callers reporting that they couldn't even get through on
the phone. Others reported that even when they did get through online, the
system wasn't updated to reflect the new eligibility criteria for
pre-existing conditions and essential workers.

Subject: Weaknesses in FAA's certification and delegation processes hindered
  its oversight of the 737 MAX 8 (DOT)

(Office of Inspector General, Transportation)

https://www.oig.dot.gov/library-item/38302

"While FAA and Boeing followed the established certification process for the
737 MAX 8, we identified limitations in FAA's guidance and processes that
impacted certification and led to a significant misunderstanding of the
Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), the flight control
software identified as contributing to the two accidents. First, FAA's
certification guidance does not adequately address integrating new
technologies into existing aircraft models. Second, FAA did not have a
complete understanding of Boeing's safety assessments performed on MCAS
until after the first accident. Communication gaps further hindered the
effectiveness of the certification process. In addition, management and
oversight weaknesses limit FAA's ability to assess and mitigate risks with
the Boeing ODA. For example, FAA has not yet implemented a risk-based
approach to ODA oversight, and engineers in FAA's Boeing oversight office
continue to face challenges in balancing certification and oversight
responsibilities. Moreover, the Boeing ODA process and structure do not
ensure ODA personnel are adequately independent. While the Agency has taken
steps to develop a risk-based oversight model and address concerns of undue
pressure at the Boeing ODA, it is not clear that FAA's current oversight
structure and processes can effectively identify future high-risk safety
concerns at the ODA."

ODA == Organization Designation Authorization is the FAA designation for
delegated certification authority of 737-MAX certifications to Boeing.  See
page 29 of this report for percent of delegation for certified flight
systems on the 737-MAX: Boeing performed ~30% certifications
(self-certifications) in JAN2014 to ~100% by JAN2017.

The OIG's report raises troubling questions about self-certification of
737-MAX flight systems by Boeing. Government delegation of certification
authority to industry indicates policy review is essential, and revisions to
delegation practices, are urgently required.

Risk: Self-certification authority without independent enforcement oversight

  Attack (Khari Johnson)

Khari Johnson, *VentureBeat*, 22 Feb 2021
via TechNews, Wednesday, February 24, 2021

EU Report Warns AI Makes Autonomous Vehicles 'Highly Vulnerable' to Attack

A report by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) describes
autonomous vehicles as "highly vulnerable to a wide range of attacks" that
could jeopardize passengers, pedestrians, and people in other vehicles. The
report identifies potential threats to self-driving vehicles as including
sensor attacks with light beams, as well as adversarial machine learning
(ML) hacks. With growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and the sensors
that power autonomous vehicles offering greater potential for attacks, the
researchers advised policymakers and businesses to foster a security culture
across the automotive supply chain, including third-party providers. The
researchers suggested AI and ML systems for autonomous vehicles "should be
designed, implemented, and deployed by teams where the automotive domain
expert, the ML expert, and the cybersecurity expert collaborate."

Subject: Heavy Rain Affects Object Detection by Autonomous Vehicle LiDAR
  Sensors (U.Warwick)

University of Warwick (U.K.) 25 Feb 2021, via ACM TechNews, 26 Feb 2021

Researchers at the University of Warwick in the U.K. have found that the
LiDAR sensors on autonomous vehicles (AVs) are less effective in detecting
objects at a distance during periods of heavy rain. The researchers used the
university's WMG 3xD simulator to test an AV's LiDAR sensors in different
intensities of rain on real roads; they found that when the rainfall
increased up to 50 mm per hour, object detection by the sensors dropped in
conjunction with a longer range in distance. Warwick's Valentina Donzella
said, "Ultimately we have confirmed that the detection of objects is
hindered to LiDAR sensors the heavier the rain and the further away they
are."

  Release Dates (KJZZ)

Jimmy Jenkins, KJZZ, February 23, 2021

https://kjzz.org/content/1660988/whistleblowers-software-bug-keeping-hundreds-inmates-arizona-prisons-beyond-release

  According to Arizona Department of Corrections whistleblowers, hundreds of
  incarcerated people who should be eligible for release are being held in
  prison because the inmate management software cannot interpret current
  sentencing laws.

  As of 2019, the department had spent more than $24 million contracting
  with IT company Business & Decision, North America to build and maintain
  the software program, known as ACIS, that is used to manage the inmate
  population in state prisons.

  One of the software modules within ACIS, designed to calculate release
  dates for inmates, is presently unable to account for an amendment to
  state law that was passed in 2019.

  Senate Bill 1310, authored by former Sen. Eddie Farnsworth, amended the
  Arizona Revised Statutes so that certain inmates convicted of nonviolent
  offenses could earn additional release credits upon the completion of
  programming in state prisons. Gov. Ducey signed the bill in June of 2019.

  But department sources say the ACIS software is not still able to identify
  inmates who qualify for SB 1310 programming, nor can it calculate their
  new release dates upon completion of the programming.

Subject: Experts find a way to learn what you're typing during video calls
  ()

A new attack framework aims to infer keystrokes typed by a target user at
the opposite end of a video conference call by simply leveraging the video
feed to correlate observable body movements to the text being typed.

The research was undertaken by Mohd Sabra, and Murtuza Jadliwala from the
University of Texas at San Antonio and Anindya Maiti from the University of
Oklahoma, who say the attack can be extended beyond live video feeds to
those streamed on YouTube and Twitch as long as a webcam's field-of-view
captures the target user's visible upper body movements.

"With the recent ubiquity of video capturing hardware embedded in many
consumer electronics, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops, the threat
of information leakage through visual channel[s] has amplified," the
researchers *said*.

"The adversary's goal is to utilize the observable upper body movements
across all the recorded frames to infer the private text typed by the
target."
<https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/ndss2021_3A-1_23063_paper.pdf>.

To achieve this, the recorded video is fed into a video-based keystroke
inference framework that goes through three stages.  [...]

Subject: Can Zapping Our Brains Really Cure Depression? (NYTimes)

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/magazine/brain-stimulation-mental-health.html

"The brain is an electrical organ. Everything that goes on in there is a
result of millivolts zipping from one neuron to another in particular
patterns. This raises the tantalizing possibility that, should we ever
decode those patterns, we could electrically adjust them to treat
neurological dysfunction -- from Alzheimers to schizophrenia -- or even
optimize desirable qualities like intelligence and resilience."

Brain tissue possesses plasticity: neural pathways can be molded. Adjust the
neural pathway, and the characteristic electrical impulses (pulse frequency
and amplitude) can modify human behavior and/or physiological response.

Exploring transcranial stimulation to treat depression suggests that
traditional therapies (talk + medicine) underachieves expected outcomes.
Depression is a significant public health disorder that requires priority
treatment.

The US CDC estimates that 4.7% of the population aged 18+ regularly
experiences feelings of depression.
(https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/depression.htm)
That's 0.047 * 255M =~ 12M people
(https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/99-total-population-by-child-and-adult-populations#detailed/1/any/false/1729,37,871,870,573,869,36,868,867,133/39,40,41/416,417) for 2019 population estimates).

The FDA assigns five product codes (OBP, OKP, QCI, QFF, QMD) for approved
medical devices based on transcranial stimulation. Visit
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfTPLC/tplc.cfm and apply
"transcranial" in the textbox to view medical device reports.

These devices typically apply electromagnetic induction (discovered by
Michael Faraday in 1831): a low-frequency, high-intensity magnetic field
therapeutically adjusts the brain's neural pathways, a personalized
electromagnetic pulse (EMP).

Patients report immediate change in emotional state when applied.  Whether
or not these therapeutic devices yield persistent palliative relief from
symptomatic depression remains to be demonstrated.

Risk: Iatrogenic result.

Subject: Student Surveillance Vendor Proctorio Files SLAPP Lawsuit to
  Silence A Critic (EFF)

Electronic Frontier Foundation

During the pandemic, a dangerous business has prospered: invading students'
privacy with proctoring software and apps. In the last year, we've seen
universities compel students to download apps that collect their face
images, driver's license data, and network information.  Students who want
to move forward with their education are sometimes forced to accept being
recorded in their own homes and having the footage reviewed for suspicious
behavior.

Given these invasions, it's no surprise that students and educators are
fighting back against these apps. Last fall, Ian Linkletter, a remote
learning specialist at the University of British Columbia, became part of a
chorus of critics concerned with this industry.

Now, he's been sued for speaking out. The outrageous lawsuit -- which relies
on a bizarre legal theory that linking to publicly viewable videos is
copyright infringement -- will become an important test of a 2019 British
Columbia law passed to defend free speech, the Protection of Public

transfer networks take Sundays off? Surely these payments are made
automatically so what's the reason Sundays are skipped?

So I'm waiting for some nonsense justification. Friend speculated:

Really, every day's a business day these days. Credit card companies have no
problem with billing days on weekends. And customers can't tell them that
they're delaying payment to Monday. So payments should be made on
weekends. Or should be made Friday before, not Monday after.

Subject: New security flaws detected in more credit cards (Leo Hermann))

Leo Hermann, ETH Zurich (Switzerland), 22 Reb 2021
Security Flaw Detected for 2nd Time in Credit Cards
via ACM TechNews, Friday, February 26, 2021

A method for bypassing security measures to use certain credit and debit
cards without a PIN code has been uncovered by researchers at Switzerland's
ETH Zurich. Previously, the researchers had demonstrated that bypassing
security was possible using Visa cards, while the new research shows
security methods may be bypassed with Mastercard and Maestro cards by
exploiting the data exchanged between the card and the card terminal. The
method initially worked only with Visa cards, but the researchers were able
to manipulate the payment process so the card terminal performed a Visa
transaction and the card itself performed a Mastercard or Maestro
transaction. The researchers informed Mastercard of their findings, after
which the company updated the relevant safeguards.

Subject: "Virtual computer chip tests expose flaws, protect against hackers"
  (Matthew Sparkes)

Matthew Sparkes, *New Scientist*, 24 Feb 2021
via ACM TechNews, Friday, February 26, 2021

Researchers at the University of Michigan, Virginia Polytechnic Institute
and State University, and Google have accelerated computer-chip testing by
simulating chips and applying advanced software testing tools for analysis
of the simulations. Virtual testing lets engineers utilize fuzzing, a method
that monitors for unexpected results or crashes that can be reviewed and
corrected. The researchers had to modify software fuzzers to run over time,
rather than trigger a single input and wait for the response. This approach
enabled a chip that would usually take 100 days to test to be analyzed in
one day. The researchers think faster hardware testing could reduce
development time and bring more reliable, more secure next-generation chips
to market faster.

Subject: Is Your Browser Extension a Botnet Backdoor? (Krebs on Security)

A company that rents out access to more than 10 million Web browsers so that
clients can hide their true Internet addresses has built its network by
paying browser extension makers to quietly include its code in their
creations. This story examines the lopsided economics of extension
development, and why installing an extension can be such a risky
proposition.

Singapore-based *Infatica[.]io* is part of a growing industry of shadowy
firms trying to woo developers who maintain popular browser extensions --
desktop and mobile device software add-ons available for download from
*Apple*, *Google*, *Microsoft* and *Mozilla* designed to add functionality
or customization to one's browsing experience.

Some of these extensions have garnered hundreds of thousands or even
millions of users. But here's the rub: As an extension's user base grows,
maintaining them with software updates and responding to user support
requests tends to take up an inordinate amount of the author's time. Yet
extension authors have few options for earning financial compensation for
their work.

So when a company comes along and offers to buy the extension -- or pay the
author to silently include some extra code -- that proposal is frequently
too good to pass up.

For its part, Infatica seeks out authors with extensions that have at least
50,000 users. An extension maker who agrees to incorporate Infatica's
computer code can earn anywhere from $15 to $45 each month for every 1,000
active users.  [...]

Subject: When Companies Skimp on Cybersecurity (Bruce Schneier)

Why was SolarWinds so vulnerable to hackers?
Bruce Schneier, *The New York Times*, Op-Ed, 24 Feb 2021

Worth reading!  Last paragraph:

  In today's unregulated markets, it's just too easy for software companies
  like SolarWinds to save money by skimping on security and to hope for the
  best[*].  That's a rational decision in our free-market world, and the
  only way to change that is to change the economic incentives.

[* Note: "Hoping for the *best*" is totally unrealistic.  It's really more

keep harping on the underlying problem that even the software is not flawed,

The password in question, "solarwinds123," was discovered in 2019 on the

Subject: Vaccine passport certificates already exist (Re: Slade, RISKS-32.50)

I'd like to point out vaccine certificates have existed for many years, and
I've just dug mine out of the filing cabinet to look at it carefully.  It is
a bright yellow booklet about the size of a passport but much thinner.  It
is labeled in English and French "International Certificate of Vaccination
In accordance with the International Health Regulations of the World Health
Organisation".  It is primarily for Yellow Fever, of course, but has pages
dedicated for Typhoid, Cholera, and "Other" which could surely cover
Covid-19.  Mine has stamps on several pages, and I've carried it a few times
when visiting countries where Yellow Fever vaccination might be required.
My certificate reminds me to get another Yellow Fever vaccination by the end
of November 2021.

So the format exists, is WHO approved, and internationally recognised.  It
is very easy to carry and read, does not require data connectivity, has no
battery to run down, and will never prompt me to update its software.  No
doubt the current document format is easy to forge but that could easily be
improved as we know from modern plastic banknotes bearing holograms that
many countries now use (but perhaps not the USA yet?).  Is it really
necessary to adopt a brand-new digital format that would require lengthy
negotiations to achieve international recognition when we already have
something in printed form that appears to work well?

Subject: Texas power outages demonstrate grid cyber-vulnerability and
  inadequacy of existing regulations (Control Global)

Following severe man-made or natural disasters, the grid and other critical
infrastructure are subject to cyberthreats but with much less
cyberprotection than normal. The recent Texas outages that were caused by
severe storms could have had the outages and recovery significantly impacted
by cyberthreats. The existing regulations and standards such as the NERC
CIPs were shown to be dangerously lacking. These gaps apply to all US
utilities and have been exploited resulting in wide-spread outages and
equipment damage. There is an opportunity to use the Texasexperience to make
needed changes to regulations and guidance on cybersecurity of critical
infrastructures. It is evident that our adversaries are watching what
happened, how we are responding, and what is being done to prevent future
grid impacts. As such, resilience means addressing what could possibly be
expected. The solution to building and operating a more resilient grid and
other critical infrastructures lies with leadership in industry, government,
Congress, and stakeholders such as credit rating agencies and insurance
companies.

This is the simplified view for the proletariat.

The market clearing price represents the marginal cost to "generate" one
additional mWh of power in the current clearing period for the current
supply and demand.

When fully operational this marginal price system (which is used in the
pricing of all demand-produced commodities ranging from Natural Gas, Oil and
Gasoline, to Electricity) is used to balance a more-or-less theoretical
price sensitive demand above baseload against the cost of production of that
commodity.

>But when last week's crisis hit and power systems faltered, the state's

And this is the root of the problem -- political interference in the
operation of a perfectly good system by artificial setting of the marginal
price such that it did not represent current operational conditions.

It is entirely possible to have low demand and rolling blackouts and
at the same time a low (or negative) marginal price.  Just because large
segments of the grid are offline does not affect the marginal price
of the supply/demand balance for the parts that are working.

This is because it is obvious to anyone with even half a working brain-cell
that in the long run paying the marginal price is more cost effective than
paying a fixed price.  If this were not the case, then all the offerers of
fixed pricing would be bankrupt because they would not be charging their
markup.
