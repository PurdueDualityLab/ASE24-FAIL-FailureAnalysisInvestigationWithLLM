Subject: Noam Chomsky: The False Promise of ChatGPT

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/opinion/noam-chomsky-chatgpt-ai.html

Jorge Luis Borges once wrote that to live in a time of great peril and
promise is to experience both tragedy and comedy, with ``the imminence of a
revelation'' in understanding ourselves and the world. Today our supposedly
revolutionary advancements in artificial intelligence are indeed cause for
both concern and optimism. Optimism because intelligence is the means by
which we solve problems. Concern because we fear that the most popular and
fashionable strain of AI -- machine learning -- will degrade our science and
debase our ethics by incorporating into our technology a fundamentally
flawed conception of language and knowledge.

``The research team calls this type of attack split view poisoning. Testing
showed that such an approach could be used to purchase enough URLs to poison
a large portion of mainstream AI systems, for as little as $10,000.

``There is another way that AI systems could be subverted -- y manipulating
data in well-known data repositories such as Wikipedia. This could be done,
the researchers note, by modifying data just prior to regular data dumps,
preventing monitors from spotting the changes before they are sent to and
used by AI systems. They call this approach front-running poisoning.''

As AI proliferates, overtrust -- reliance on output -- elevates training
dataset's provenance and bona fides to bound false positive/negative
outcomes.

Subject: Detection Stays Ahead of Deepfakes -- for Now (Matthew Hutson)

Matthew Hutson, *IEEE Spectrum*, 6 Mar 2023, via ACM TechNews, March 8, 2023

Computer scientists are developing more advanced algorithms for generating
synthetic content, at the same time they are creating counter-algorithms to
detect such content. Intel's Real-Time Deepfake Detector, slated for release
this spring, will include FakeCatcher, which can identify facial changes due
to blood flow. Developed by researchers at Intel and Binghamton University,
FakeCatcher cannot be reverse-engineered easily to train a generation
algorithm to get better at fooling it. Among other detection tools,
researchers at the University of Florida developed a system that models the
human vocal tract and can determine if an audio recording is biologically
plausible. When it comes to detecting synthetic text, the University of
Maryland's Tom Goldstein said the diversity in how people use language and a
dearth of signal means it likely will lag other forms of detection.

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), the tax department of Canada, recently
updated its terms and conditions to force taxpayers to agree that CRA is not
liable if their personal information is stolen while using the My Account
online service portal -- which, ironically, all Canadians must use when doing
their taxes and/or running their business.

Subject: Password changing considered harmful (WSJ)

  [Long item PGN-ed.]

https://www.wsj.com/articles/annoying-password-rules-actually-make-us-less-secure-a05edb70

Annoying Password Rules Actually Make Us Less Secure

Does your company network or a frequently visited website force you to come
up with a new password because it has declared your old one is past its
expiration date?

If you find that annoying, you're not alone. What's worse: It's actually bad
for cybersecurity, say researchers.

The scheduled-replacement policy is one of a number of poor or ineffective
password practices that make logging into sites, apps and services more
complicated and annoying than ever.

We're not just talking about issues with government and corporate IT
systems, though they can be among the worst offenders. Companies and
services including Apple, Microsoft, Instagram and LinkedIn, among others,
all have less-than-optimal password policies, according to a recent paper by
researchers at Princeton University.

These password policies can increase the chance that individuals' accounts
can be breached, especially if users aren't using additional means of
securing their accounts, such as two-factor authentication, says Arvind
Narayanan, a professor of computer science at Princeton and one of the
authors of the paper on bad password policies.

Compelling routine password changes, for example, while a seemingly logical
way to reset a password that may have been leaked, actually tends to make
people more likely to choose weak passwords in the first place, according to
numerous studies. Another flawed-but-common practice is to limit the
combinations of characters one can use in a password, or compel users to
include special characters in their passwords. It turns out those rules
don't generally lead to more secure passwords, either.  [...]

Making better security available isn't enough

Cybersecurity-savvy readers may, by now, be throwing up their hands in
exasperation. Of course these are all bad password policies! But do they
matter, if a person uses two-factor authentication on their most important
accounts, and they're using a password manager to generate a unique and
complicated password for everything they log into? (A password manager,
which everyone should adopt, generates strong passwords, stores them and
automatically enters them into apps and sites.)  [...]

In sum, the key to making individuals and organizations more secure
is to create cybersecurity policies that respect how people actually
behave in the real world.

``I think security has always been everybody's problem, but now we are
realizing it, And I think a well-designed security system can help reduce
the burden on the non-security experts on the team.''  [Dr. Lorrie Cranor,
who is quoted heavily throughout the article.  PGN]

Subject: Terms of enscamment?

I have mentioned that a number of people seem to think that my GMail email
address, rslade@gmail.com, is theirs.  I've received all kinds of email
messages, over the years, from legitimate vendors and contacts, who have
apparently been told to use rslade@gmail.com as the contact for a bunch of
people who aren't me.

Mostly I think it's just carelessness.  I wonder, at times, if sometimes it
could, partly, be part of a scam by someone who is hiding their own
identity.  I try to look at any of these messages from a variety of
perspectives.

Today I got a message from Eventbrite.  It seems to be legitimately from
Eventbrite.  Someone bought tickets to *Terms of Endearment*--in Shanghai,
China.  (Ticket prices seem to be fairly steep in China: they are $23.17
each, according to the statement.)  (Then again, it may be live theatre,
rather than an old movie, so, in that case, it's pretty cheap.)  Seven
people seem to be going.  The tickets are paid, by a MasterCard account that
is not mine.  The event seems to be about 22 hours from now, if the world
clock Website that I use frequently is correct.

I hope that they get in and enjoy the show.  I'm pretty sure that there is
no risk to me, and the only risk I can see is that they may not get in if
they don't get the tickets.  I do wonder why Eventbrite let them buy tickets
on my account without knowing my password, but that is presumably
Eventbrite's problem ...

Madison City Council looks to sue Kia, Hyundai, for making it too easy to
steal cars

Since the article itself, dated 2023-03-07, is behind a paywall, I've copied
it for you:

  The city of Madison [Wisconsin] is gearing up to sue car manufacturers Kia
  and Hyundai over the lack of anti-theft software in their vehicles after
  they accounted for nearly half of thefts of cars in the city last summer.

  City council members will take up a resolution Tuesday night over whether
  the city can retain outside counsel for a federal lawsuit for Kia and
  Hyundai's ``role in creating a public nuisance,'' a statement from the
  city said.

Car thefts dropped by 5%

in Madison last summer, compared to the prior year, but thefts of Kia and
Hyundai cars increased by 270%, making up 45% of all stolen auto cases in
July and August. Rates of Kia and Hyundai thefts are even higher in
Milwaukee, where the two brands comprise 60% of all stolen autos.
<https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2023/02/20/new-class-action-lawsuit-by-milwaukee-man-targets-kia-hyundai/69924626007/>

The two brands are especially susceptible to theft because of a
manufacturing flaw in less-expensive models that allows vehicles to be
stolen even if a key isn't present. Viral TikTok challenges spearheaded by
Milwaukee-based *Kia Boys* taught people how advantage of that flaw by
starting the engine with a USB cable and a screwdriver.

``Madison residents deserve better,'' Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said in a
statement.  ``These corporations cut corners and put people at risk. In
their search for profits, they pushed the costs of keeping people safe off
to cities like Madison. That's unacceptable.''

In his rant, Mr. Dawkins falls into the common trap of defending science(tm)
[insert Chester from the Bunnicula cartoons here] against political
interference: from most scientists' point of view, science is supposed to
dictate politics, not the other way around! Unsurprisingly, politicians
often feel exactly the opposite, and this is thus is a likely factor leading
to Mr. Hipkins's intervention.

Furthermore, I think it's very ironic of Mr. Dawkins to allege *special
treatment* for the Maori when the colonists made themselves the exception
from virtually the moment they arrived (and have been doing so ever since),
at the near-total expense of the original human population! Now who needs
*special treatment*, eh?

The *forcing to learn* issue comes down to a discussion about unschooling
and that, too, seems to be pretty off-topic for this list.

Overall it would seem wise to move the discussion onwards from *how do we
protect the institution of science against those barbarian politicans?* to
*how can we be more empirical and less dogmatic?'' If anything, science(tm)
[insert Chester again] desperately needs the latter discussion, not the
former.

But the newspapers won't be interested. No shock value. I'm hoping
better for this list.

Subject: Re: rm -rf

I've been discussing this problem with Sylvestre Ledru, who has been
*re-implementing* the so-called 'Core Utilities' in *Rust*.
<sylvestre@debian.org>

So far, he's been trying to implement compatibility with the Gnu Core Utils
(but with fewer errors, of which there have been precious few for Gnu).

But these Core Utilities form the basis of a computer *language* that is
extensively used by Unix/Linux developers, and have never been completely
systematized.

For example, in the case of error conditions, one is never 100% sure what
state the system will be left in.  This isn't normally a problem for
individual execution from an interactive user, but it becomes a serious
problem in scripts.

I have suggested that these *core utilities* have *clean composable
semantics* with *predictable* results; including undoing any visible
side-effects, when this makes sense.

For example, one principle which might be helpful for *most* such utilities:
either run to completion w/o errors, or reset the state to the situation
prior to the start of execution.  I.e., an *atomic* 'all-or-none' set of
side-effects, along the lines of 'ACID' databases:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID

I realize this won't help when 'cd' errs out, but perhaps something like

  cd foo &amp;&amp; rm -rf

is the right solution ?

  cd --help:

That is a good idea and one I had not taken advantage of. However, one needs
to be careful about the effects it may have on other parts of the script,
including external scripts invoked from the script where you code the set
command.  Also, there are cases where you want to run a command and test its
outcome (like access to a file or other resource) where continuation of the
script is preferable at that point. Of course you can encase those sections
of code inside a subshell with pipefail turned off. But care should still be
taken with any global setting.
