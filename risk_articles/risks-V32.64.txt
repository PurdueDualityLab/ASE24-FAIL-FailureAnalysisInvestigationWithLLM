Subject: Feds Arrest an Alleged $336M Bitcoin-Laundering Kingpin (WiReD)

Most remarkable, however, is the IRS's account of tracking down Sterlingov
using the very same sort of blockchain analysis that his own service was
meant to defeat. The complaint outlines how Sterlingov allegedly paid for
the server hosting of Bitcoin Fog at one point in 2011 using the now-defunct
digital currency Liberty Reserve. It goes on to show the blockchain evidence
that identifies Sterlingov's purchase of that Liberty Reserve currency with
bitcoins: He first exchanged euros for the bitcoins on the early
cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox, then moved those bitcoins through several
subsequent addresses, and finally traded them on another currency exchange
for the Liberty Reserve funds he'd use to set up Bitcoin Fog's domain.

Based on tracing those financial transactions, the IRS says, it then
identified Mt. Gox accounts that used Sterlingov's home address and phone
number, and even a Google account that included a Russian-language document
on its Google Drive offering instructions for how to obscure Bitcoin
payments. That document described exactly the steps Sterlingov allegedly
took to buy the Liberty Reserve funds he'd used.

The case shows yet another example of how Bitcoin, once widely believed to
be a powerful tool for making anonymous, untraceable transactions, has
turned out to be in many cases the very opposite. The blockchain's ledger of
all Bitcoin transactions since the cryptocurrency's creation has often
instead served as a means for law enforcement to trace even years-old
transactions.

The risk? Tracing the untraceable.

Subject: U.S. Mulling Domestic Spying Partnership with Private Companies
  (Infosecurity Magazine)

The Biden administration is reportedly considering teaming up with private
companies to monitor American citizens' private online activity and digital
communications.

According to news source CNN, multiple sources have said that the Department
of Homeland Security (DHS) is actively seeking a way to monitor citizens
online without having to first secure a warrant or prove that such
monitoring is an essential part of an ongoing investigation.

The sources said that a plan is being formed for the DHS to circumvent these
established checks to the government's power by working directly with
private firms.

Currently, only the unprotected information that Americans share on social
media sites and public online platforms can be accessed by federal
authorities.

However, the alleged plan being formed by the DHS would allow authorities to
see what Americans are writing and sharing online in access-restricted
spaces such as private Facebook groups.

The plan is reportedly not centered on the decryption of data belonging to
Americans but is instead focused on getting outside entities with legal
access to the information being shared online to report what is being said
to the government.

Limits are also in place at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and
National Security Administration (NSA) when it comes to domestic espionage.

A team of computer-science researchers has uncovered a line of attack that
breaks all Spectre defenses, meaning that billions of computers and other
devices across the globe are just as vulnerable today as they were when
Spectre was first announced.

  generally require hardware changes, and cannot be adequately resolved with

Subject: Paying ransomware doesn't pay

OK, I have, elsewhere, expressed my opinion that paying the ransom for
ransomware is a bad idea.  https://community.isc2.org/t5/I/P/m-p/18736 First
off, you are funding crime.  Secondly, you are encouraging crime.  (If
nobody paid the ransoms, they'd stop doing ransomware, wouldn't they?)

Then there are the various reasons why paying the ransomware isn't a good
idea in simply practical terms.  Some of the ransomware was never intended
to allow you to recover.  Some is badly coded, and doesn't work when
decrypting.  Some of the ransomware families are simply based on symmetric
encryption, and one key decrypts all.  (You can find lists of those, and the
ways to recover, at various places on the net.)  Some of the ransomware
groups are just disorganized, and lose their keys.

(Then there are those who confuse ransomware with breachstortion, and are
talking about people who actually do steal your data, and then threaten to
publish it unless you pay up.  Most of the same reasons why paying ransom
to them is a bad idea hold, with the addition of the fact that, if you pay
the ransom, you are relying on the promises and integrity of a bunch of
thieves, liars, and extortionists.)

(Oh, and that argument about the "business model" of ransomware and
breachstortion being based on them doing what they promise?  That business
model only works if you are talking about return or repeat business.  Are
you telling me that you are going to go through ransom or extortion with
the same group all over again?  How stupid *are* you?)

Now some research from Sophos backs that up.  If you pay, you've got a less
than 10% chance of getting all your data back.
https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2021/05/02/ransomware-reality-shock-92-who-pay-dont-get-their-data-back

  [Speaking of "backs that up", can you spell "backup" -- which allows one
  to recover without paying.  Yes, that does not help with breachstortion,
  but once again, the real answer seems to better security in hardware and
  software, and more-aware users and admins.  PGN]

Let's say you are an extra big company, with an extra small single point of
contact: the Feedback Form. But what if it breaks?  Every other form of
contact just plays a recording:
  "Please use the Feedback Form."
How to give Feedback about the Feedback Form?

1) Determine the headquarters of aforementioned extra big company is merely
  a couple miles from the headquarters of RISKS moderator PGN.

2) Send PGN on a mission to give a certain Mr. Zuckerburg feedback. PGN says
  "Having walked all the way from SRI, I'll be dead soon." Alas, the
  secretary says "He's with a client. I don't know what to do."

"Travelers should be aware that those seemingly safe animal souvenirs they

devastate our livestock industries, sicken our citizens, and impact our
nation's economy," said Keith Fleming, acting director of Field Operations
for CBP's Baltimore Field Office, in a release.  "Customs and Border
Protection remains on our nation's frontline as protectors of our

That description is misleading to the point of being incorrect. The incident
began on the runway during a touch and go after several hours of training
flights the same day. During that time there had been almost a dozen alerts
that something was wrong with the pitch-control system. All alerts had been
reset and then ignored. At some point one alert was not reset, causing a
loss of redundancy.

Indeed, one of the casual factors determined by the accident investigation
was the training instructor's decision to continue the training flights
despite the multiple fault messages. So arguably this was not a case of
automation surprising pilots, but rather of poor decision-making.

This, of course, is nonsense.

1. The A320 has two elevator aileron computers (ELAC), three spoiler
  elevator computers (SEC), and two flight augmentation computers (FAC), for
  a total of seven. The aerodynamic control surface actuators are commanded
  by combinations of these.

2. There is no way to control the aircraft aerodynamically if all FCCs fail.

  (James Rundle, RISKS-32.63)

James Rundle wrote: "At an April 22 virtual event hosted by Cyber Education
Institute LLC's Billington Cybersecurity unit, U.S. Department of Defense's
John Sherman said the public and private sectors should adopt zero-trust
models that constantly verify whether a device, user, or program should be
able to do what it is asking to do."

The "Zero Trust Architecture" from
https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf

Deployment of ZTA strategies appears to advocate a centralized policy
decision point (PDP) and policy enforcement point (PEP) that oversees and
continuously monitors identity, credential, access, and authorization to
legitimate an organization's resources (devices, services, and users). A
complex, multi-dimensional privilege matrix is likely monitored and
characterized for resource operation based on access, authorization,
feature/capability/purpose, role, etc.

On paper, ZTA enhances infosec defense-in-depth and is proactive. A
significant change from the reactive infosec practices widely deployed today
that invite data breach/malware infection.

Risk: Legitimized resource access through a control gateway.

Compromise the PDP/PEP and/or the policy administrator who operates it, and
the resource is compromised.
