UK govt accused of covering up failed Trident nuclear missile test

London (AFP) - The British government was accused on Sunday of covering up a
failed test of its nuclear weapons deterrent last year, just weeks before
lawmakers voted to renew the system.  [...]

*The Sunday Times* newspaper, citing a senior naval source, claimed that the
Trident II D5 missile failed after being launched from a British submarine
off the coast of Florida in June.

The cause of the failure is top secret but the source suggested the missile
may have veered off in the wrong direction towards the United States.

Subject: Clip from Schlosser's Command and Control

Excerpt from Eric Schlosser's "Command and Control," Penguin, 2013, P.475

All of these military computer networks are far more technologically
advanced than the gold telephone that used to connect General LeMay to the
White House. But sometimes they experience a glitch. In October 2010 a
computer failure at F. E. Warren Air Force Base knocked fifty Minuteman III
missiles offline. For almost an hour, launch crews could not communicate
with their missiles. One third of the Minuteman IIIs at the base had been
rendered inoperable. The Air Force denied that the system had been hacked
and later found the cause of the problem: a circuit card was improperly
installed in one of the computers during routine maintenance.  But the
hacking of America's nuclear command-and-control system remains a serious
threat. In January 2013, a report by the Defense Science Board warned that
the system's vulnerability to a large-scale cyber attack had never been
fully assessed. Testifying before Congress, the head of the U.S. Strategic
Command, General C. Robert Kehler, expressed confidence that no "significant
vulnerability" existed. Nevertheless, he said that an "end-to-end
comprehensive review" still needed to be done, that "we don't know what we
don't know," and that the age of the command-and-control system might
inadvertently offer some protection against the latest hacking
techniques. Asked whether Russia and China had the ability to prevent a
cyberattack from launching one of their nuclear missiles, Kehler replied,
"Senator, I don't know."

http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/world/europe/russia-hacking-us-election.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share

Two Russian intelligence officers who worked on cyberoperations and a
Russian computer security expert have been arrested and charged with treason
for providing information to the United States, according to multiple
Russian news reports.

As in most espionage cases, the details made public so far are incomplete,
and some rumors in Moscow suggest that those arrested may be scapegoats in
an internal power struggle over the hacking. Russian media reports link the
charges to the disclosure of the Russian role in attacking state election
boards, including the scanning of voter rolls in Arizona and Illinois, and
do not mention the parallel attacks on the D.N.C. and the email of John
Podesta, Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman.

But one current and one former United States official, speaking about the
classified recruitments on condition of anonymity, confirmed that human
sources in Russia did play a crucial role in proving who was responsible for
the hacking.  [...]

Subject: Verizon remotely disables remaining Galaxy Note 7 phones

How much true value is there in an expensive product that becomes useless
when the original battery needs replacement or is found to be unsafe to use?

Normally having a battery is a good thing even if you run on utility power
most of the time. I've used employer-supplied laptops with dialup VPN
connections to carry on work from during power outages. I also bought a
personal use XP laptop with a dead battery, but it still runs with Tails OS,
connected to a wall plug, when I travel or have to use a wireless or
untrustworthy wired connection during local conferences.

The Phoebus Cartel might be considered a historical anomaly but for the Auto
Industry Planned Obsolescence was a high priority corporate goal long before
Apple began persuading people to purchase and discard electronic gimcracks
every year or two. Now we see firmware becoming an integral part of
expensive consumer purchases for big ticket Internet connected things such
as cars, clothes washers and refrigerators. The VW emissions firmware
scandal shows that we should not trust corporations.

The right of consumers and consumer protective organizations to analyze
firmware and to block unwanted updates should be given legal protection, not
restricted. If it isn't we will never know whether our car or clothes washer
stopped working because it was worn out, or because the maker told it to
stop working.

Subject: TOR servers misused for spam

I am running a simple website with a number of CGI-based forms for client
input or feedback. In these years, I have been blocking Spammers using
.htaccess, denying access to IP addresses that spam.  Since about one month,
the amount of spam via this website has increased an order of magnitude, if
not more.

A significant increase of spam messages come from Urkraine, Kazachstan,
Russia, and other (former) Soviet or East European countries.

However, I also see an increase of sites where you wouldn't expect such bad
behavior, such as Microsoft and MIT. The response of the abuse departments
is that they cannot block them, since these are TOR-based servers. The
answer from MIT is copied below:

  ----start response---
  Hello.

  Thank you for the report.

  The IP address in question is a Tor exit node.
  https://www.torproject.org/overview.html

  There is little we can do to trace this matter further. As can be seen
  from the overview page, the Tor network is designed to make tracing of
  users impossible. The Tor network is run by some 5000 volunteers who use
  the free software provided by the Tor Project to run Tor routers.  Client
  connections are routed through multiple relays, and are multiplexed
  together on the connections between relays. The system does not record
  logs of client connections or previous hops.

  The Tor project does provide an automated DNSRBL for you to query to flag
  requests from Tor nodes as requiring special treatment:

  ---end response---

The risk is that TOR servers with its good intent to help protect anonymity
will pollute regular Internet traffic.

OpenSSL issues new patches as Heartbleed still lurks
The latest OpenSSL update may only address moderate-severity
vulnerabilities, but admins shouldn't get lax about staying current
with the patches
http://www.infoworld.com/article/3162426/security/openssl-issues-new-patches-as-heartbleed-still-lurks.html

selected text:

The OpenSSL Project has addressed some moderate-severity security flaws, and
administrators should be particularly diligent about applying the patches
since there are still 200,000 systems vulnerable to the Heartbleed flaw.

A disproportionate number of systems on this list were servers hosted on
Amazon Web Services. That may have more to do with the fact that it's easy
for anyone to spin up new AWS instances, than with an actual issue in
AWS. With IT security out of the loop, there's no one enforcing security
controls on what types of software to install when setting up the server,
which means there's nothing stopping the server owner from adding the
vulnerable version of OpenSSL to the stack. Some of the virtual servers may
be abandoned and forgotten, and since they were created outside of the IT
process, no one knows to look for them to check the OpenSSL version.

"If there are servers that are vulnerable, then it's because people aren't
aware they have them," said Mike Pittenger, vice president of strategy for
Black Duck Software.

Facebook is changing its Trending section to fight the spread of fake news
https://www.recode.net/2017/1/25/14376734/facebook-trending-topics-update-fake-news

  Facebook is updating Trending, the section of the service that highlights
  popular topics being discussed on Facebook, to better prevent fake news
  stories from appearing there.  As part of the update, Facebook says it's
  going to stop pulling in trending topics that surface based off a single
  news report. Instead, it'll feature topics that have been covered by a
  number of media outlets, an attempt to avoid one-off fake news stories
  that get lots of people talking but haven't been vetted by other media
  organizations.  "We think it'll help [minimize] cases where maybe one
  specific story goes viral even if there might not be something real going
  on in the world about that story," said Will Cathcart, a VP of product
  management at Facebook.

Facebook continues to be in the lead fighting fake news, while Google lags

because he he was out of cellphone coverage.  It was immediately followed by

We seem to be at risk of making our cars cellphone dependent.

They're not at all the same.  Leap years are perfectly regular and

The problem with leap seconds is that they do affect the calculations, and

As someone who travels a lot for business, sometimes to relatively unknown

couple of clearly marked USB cables that don't have any data lines in them.
They are power-only. Now I don't have to care what USB port I plug in to,
whether it's a public charging station or a friendly stranger's laptop.

OK, the problem of a high-voltage USB killer isn't solved by this, but
that's not my threat model (yet).
