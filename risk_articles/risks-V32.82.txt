"As artificial intelligence changes our world, it has sparked a new arms
race between China and the US. Both countries are pouring billions into
cutting-edge technology. Experts warn that without urgent regulation, we
could lose control of AI."

Chongqing (population ~16M in 2019) is wired with ~300K cameras that
continuously surveils the population, applying facial recognition to ensure
public order, and to suppress the free expression of ideas that might
challenge the supremacy of political governance priorities.

See "Universal Declaration of Human Rights," retrieved from from
https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights on
08AUG2021. Article 2 is most relevant in this case.

A globally enforced treaty that proscribes AI deployment used to suppress
human rights would be required. Treaty negotiations among practitioners of
political governance philosophies that explicitly marginalize individual
freedoms are unlikely to materialize.

Risk: Basic human right to free expression suppressed with AI.

deploys more than 50% of this total. Who watches the watchers?]

Subject: Clearing the heavens of space junk (CBS News)

If you're going to be a character in a space movie, like "Space Cowboys" or
"Gravity," you've got to watch out for space junk; everybody knows that. But
what not everyone knows is that that plot twist isn't fiction anymore.

"I got a call from my chief satellite officer, he said, 'We've lost track of
our satellite vehicle number 33 somewhere over Siberia; it may have been hit
by something,'" recalled Matt Desch, the CEO of Iridium, whose 66 satellites
provide voice and data connections for governments, companies, air traffic
and shipping.
<https://www.iridium.com/>

In 2009, a defunct Russian satellite crashed into one of Iridium's.
<https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-and-russian-satellites-collide/>

Correspondent David Pogue asked Desch, "So, how bad was the damage?"

"Well, it completely took out our satellite," he replied.

The Iridium disaster was a wake-up call for the space industry. "There's
estimated to be, like, 130 million tiny pieces smaller than the size of your
thumb out there," said Desch. "And at 17,000 miles an hour, they can do
damage."

The litter in low Earth orbit has become a constant danger to the
International Space Station. In May, astronauts there discovered a hole in
the station's giant robotic arm.  Fortunately, the arm still works, but it
was a lucky strike *this* time.  [...]

Subject: Facebook is reportedly trying to analyze encrypted data without

The approach could bolster Facebook's ad-targeting efforts*

Facebook is reportedly looking into analyzing the content of encrypted data
without having to decrypt it. The company is recruiting artificial
intelligence researchers to study the matter, according to *The Information*.
<https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-researchers-hope-to-bring-together-two-foes-encryption-and-ads>
Their research could pave the way for Facebook to target ads based on
encrypted WhatsApp messages. Facebook could also use the findings to
encrypt user data without affecting its ad targeting approaches.

This area of research is called "homomorphic encryption," which relies
heavily on mathematics. Microsoft, Amazon and Google are also working on the
approach. The aim of homomorphic encryption is to allow companies to read
and analyze data while keeping it encrypted to protect information from
cybersecurity dangers and to maintain privacy.  [...]

Subject: Brooklyn Tech students uncovered an NYC schools data breach
  (Brooklyner)

Teachers’ social security numbers, student academic records, and
families’ home addresses are among the dozens of pieces of information a
group of tech-savvy high school students stumbled across on Google Drive
this year, reports Chalkbeat's Pooja Salhotra.

The documents — many of which contained confidential information — were
leaked because of a quirk in the education department’s Google Drive
sharing settings, a group of Brooklyn Technical High School students found.

The students then requested a meeting with a senior staff member at
their school, an email obtained by Chalkbeat confirms. At the meeting,
the Brooklyn Tech student recalls, the staff member listened as the
students walked through a PowerPoint presentation explaining the privacy
issues in the education department’s Google Drive. The presentation
included a slide with photos of some of the shared documents, including
a template the students themselves created saying “Brooklyn Tech is
better than Stuyvesant.” (Brooklyn Tech and Stuyvesant are two of the
city’s top high schools.)

Subject: A Critical Random Number Generator Flaw Affects Billions of IoT
  Devices (The Hacker News)

A critical vulnerability has been disclosed in hardware random number
generators used in billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices whereby it
fails to properly generate random numbers, thus undermining their security
and putting them at risk of attacks.

"It turns out that these 'randomly' chosen numbers aren't always as random
as you'd like when it comes to IoT devices," Bishop Fox researchers Dan
Petro and Allan Cecil *said*
<https://labs.bishopfox.com/tech-blog/youre-doing-iot-rng> in an analysis
published last week. "In fact, in many cases, devices are choosing
encryption keys of 0 or worse. This can lead to a catastrophic collapse of
security for any upstream use."

Random-number generation (*RNG*) is a *crucial process* that undergirds
several cryptographic applications, including key generation, nonces, and
salting. On traditional operating systems, it's derived from a
cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) that uses
entropy obtained from a high-quality seed source.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation>)
<https://www.veracode.com/blog/research/cryptographically-secure-pseudo-random-number-generator-csprng>

When it comes to IoT devices, this is supplied from a system-on-a-chip (SoC)
that houses a dedicated hardware RNG peripheral called a true random number
generator (TRNG) that's used to capture randomness from physical processes
or phenomenа.

Stating that the manner in which the peripheral is being current invoked was
incorrect, the researchers noted the lack of checks for error code responses
across the board, leading to a scenario where the random number generated
isn't simply random, and worse, predictable, resulting in partial entropy,
uninitialized memory, and even crypto keys containing plain zeros.   [...]

Subject: Bugs in Managed DNS Services Cloud Let Attackers Spy On DNS Traffic
  (The Hacker News)

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new class of vulnerabilities
impacting major DNS-as-a-Service (DNSaaS) providers that could allow
attackers to exfiltrate sensitive information from corporate networks.

"We found a simple loophole that allowed us to intercept a portion of
worldwide dynamic DNS traffic going through managed DNS providers like
Amazon and Google," researchers Shir Tamari and Ami Luttwak from
infrastructure security firm Wiz said,
<https://www.wiz.io/blog/black-hat-2021-dns-loophole-makes-nation-state-level-spying-as-easy-as-registering-a-domain>

Calling it a "bottomless well of valuable intel," the treasure trove of
information contains internal and external IP addresses, computer names,
employee names and locations, and details about organizations' web domains.
The findings were presented at the Black Hat USA 2021 security conference
last week.
<https://www.blackhat.com/us-21/briefings/schedule/#a-new-class-of-dns-vulnerabilities-affecting-many-dns-as-service-platforms-23563>

"The traffic that leaked to us from internal network traffic provides
malicious actors all the intel they would ever need to launch a successful
attack," the researchers added. "More than that, it gives anyone a bird's
eye view on what's happening inside companies and governments. We liken this
to having nation-state level spying capability – and getting it was as easy
as registering a domain." [...]

Subject: Mesa County Colorado secure election systems passwords posted on
  political blog

Mesa County is in Western Colorado with the county seat in the city of Grand
Junction. Colorado is one of the states that use vote my mail. They use
Dominion Systems ballot design, scanners, and tabulation software.  Dominion
is based in Denver and 62 of 64 Colorado use their systems.

Vote-by-mail is one of the most secure vote tabulation systems. The paper
ballots are an enduring record that can be recounted.

The Mesa County Attorney General has launched a criminal investigation of
the leak of passwords used for the systems in Mesa County. The Colorado
Secretary of State is investigating.

The passwords were spread by a central 8Chan/QAnon figure to the
GatewayPundit blog.

Dominion was and continues to be the target of conspiracy theories of
election rigging in the 2020 race. As a result, Dominion is suing media
outlets FOX, OAN, Newsmax and individuals for defamation.

I led the early Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)
project on the security and reliability of elections systems. (PGN has been
a central motivating force since those early beginnings. Thanks!)

Elections systems employ overlapping test, audit, chains of custody,
employee trust, verification and transparency - human methods, to complement
technical methods.

Here, the access logs, physical security, surveillance, and audit trails are
being employed to find the source of the purloined passwords, any subsequent
systems security breaches, and the involvement of elections professionals.

Such attacks can result in voters distrusting results of elections. We will
have to work harder to explain our continuing work in trustworthy vote
counting.

One of the great challenges from that early CPSR work, beginning about
1987-88, was to maintain an objective and factual tone when conspiracy
theories motivated some of our volunteers.

We look forward to the complete documentation resulting from the
investigation.

Subject: Why you should care about Zoom’s $85m privacy lawsuit (Ars Technica)

*Zoom has agreed to pay an $85 million settlement
<https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/08/zoom-to-pay-85m-for-lying-about-encryption-and-sending-data-to-facebook-and-google/>
after falsely claiming calls were protected with end-to-end encryption and
for handing over people’s data to Facebook and Google without their consent.
This is the latest development in a list of privacy and security issues
faced by the video platform that we first wrote about back in March 2020
<https://protonmail.com/blog/zoom-privacy-issues/>.*

*Why Zoom has agreed to an $85 million settlement*

In March 2020, The Intercept reported
<https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/zoom-meeting-encryption/> that Zoom had
lied about the encryption used for their video calls. In short, the video
communication service claimed that it used end-to-end encryption when it did
not. Around the same time, Vice reported
<https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7e599/zoom-ios-app-sends-data-to-facebook-even-if-you-dont-have-a-facebook-account>
that Zoom was also sharing user data with companies, including Facebook and
Google, without consent. (Zoom has since fixed
<https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-use-of-facebook-sdk-in-ios-client/> these
data-sharing practices.)

Zoom also had some major security issues, including default settings that
allowed online trolls to take over public calls in an act known as
“Zoombombing”, and vulnerabilities that allowed hackers to access people’s
webcams
<https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/07/zoom-makes-it-too-easy-for-hackers-to-access-webcams-heres-what-to-do/>.
For more information on Zoom’s privacy and security issues, you can read
our full breakdown <https://protonmail.com/blog/zoom-privacy-issues/>.

The Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint against Zoom
<https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/11/ftc-requires-zoom-enhance-its-security-practices-part-settlement>
in November 2020 after The Intercept exposed these holes in Zoom’s
service. As a result, Zoom agreed to security improvements and a
“prohibition on privacy and security misrepresentations”. Now, on 7 July
2021, Zoom has also agreed to pay an $85 million settlement, including
compensation for those who were affected by these security
shortcomings. People who are entitled to compensation will receive between
just $15 and $25 each if the settlement is approved in court.

The maximum compensation of $25 doesn’t reflect the extent to which Zoom
misled the people who used its services, nor the gravity of the potential
consequences of doing so. Is this proposed settlement enough to make tech
companies start taking user privacy and security seriously? And what can we
do to better protect our data?.  [...]

This is the key paragraph. It was *not* a cyberattack on the vessels, it was
a data spoofing attack on the website that presents AIS data.

There have been a spate of such attacks on MarineTraffic.com and similar
sites over the past years.  In *no* way do these attacks impact actual safe
navigation of the vessels involved.  AIS transmission is short range VHF
radio and displays on other vessels (typically) on their navigation systems
(GPS chartplot).

What you see on MarineTraffic et al. is VHF AIS signals picked up by various
sources and then pushed into their servers.

Most interestingly, a number of those spoofs have involved warships:

Not much of an expert if he wasn't aware of AIS spoofing (and some
piss poor journalism, to boot).
