Subject: The dangerous business of dismantling America's aging nuclear
 plants (WashPost)

Accidents at New Jersey's Oyster Creek power plant have spurred calls for
stricter oversight of the burgeoning nuclear decommissioning industry.

Joseph Delmar, a spokesman for Holtec, defended the company's record, saying
it takes safety and security seriously. The recent incidents ``are not
reflective of the organization's culture,'' he said, adding that the worker
who knocked down the power line ``did not follow the proper safety
protocols.''  Delmar said the company has decades of experience building
equipment to store nuclear waste and employs veteran plant workers to
dismantle reactor sites.

``While the decommissioning organization may seem new, the professionals
staffing the company are experienced nuclear professionals with intimate
knowledge of the plants they work at,'' Delmar said in an emailed statement.

Accelerated decommissioning

Founded and wholly owned by Kris Singh, an inventor and entrepreneur, Holtec
says it is pioneering a new model of accelerated decommissioning.  At the
24 U.S. reactors currently undergoing decommissioning, over half are
expected to take two decades or more to complete the process, NRC data
shows; Holtec pledges to return nuclear sites to safe, clean usable land in
as few as eight years. Singh did not respond to requests for comment, and
Holtec did not make him available for an interview.  [...]

``I went from a staff of six to a staff of two, all having extra
responsibilities, doubling our workload and learning new criteria of the
positions,' the manager said in the letter, which was posted on the NRC's
website.

In a settlement with the NRC announced this year, Holtec agreed to pay a
$50,000 civil penalty, hire a new corporate security director and conduct
external security assessments.  [...]

In 2017, Holtec opened the doors of a stately new manufacturing center in
Camden, N.J., that showcases Singh's accomplishments. Employees arriving at
the main office building on the Krishna P. Singh Technology Campus walk by a
parking space reserved for the CEO's chauffeured Rolls-Royce and into an
atrium where more than 100 patents bearing Singh's name are on display.

When Britain voted for Brexit, Macron boasted that Paris would eat the City
of London's lunch. It didn't quite work out that way, with most league
tables continuing to put London as the number one or two financial centre,
with not a single EU city in the top ten. Emmanuel Macron's government has
now announced that it has invited Binance, a crypto-currency exchange site,
to set up a European HQ in Paris. You have to ask: has Macron leaped onto a
bandwagon that has already started to lose its wheels? [...]

Paralyzed since 2006, Dennis DeGray has regained a semblance of control over
his body via a brain-computer interface (BCI) developed by Stanford
University researchers. Implanted in him in 2016, the BCI enables DeGray to
move a cursor on a computer screen by thought, using machine learning
algorithms that associate different neural activity patterns with different
intended hand movements. DeGray has learned to control various technologies
with his mind, including videogames, robotic limbs, and a simulated aerial
drone. BCI advancements to date have relied on a combination of invasive and
noninvasive technologies. Thomas Oxley at BCI developer Synchron believes
future models will help physically disabled people re-engage with physical
and digital environments.

  [This is really seminal work, and opens up many opportunities.  There are
  many potential risks -- security, reliability, denials of service attacks,
  and more.  However, for some reason it reminded me of a book I read in
  1978 when it first appeared, which might seem timely now:

    Ingo Swann, Star Fire: The War To End All Wars Has Begun --
    Rock superstar-composer Dan Merriweather is the world's first true
    megapsychic. And when he discovers the true extent of his extraordinary
    powers, and his out-of-body voyages reveal the existence of top-secret
    U.S. and Russian installations for the development of psychic weapons
    more frightening than any nuclear or bacteriological hardware, he
    evolves an astounding plan to transform the world. [...]

  then. PGN]

Subject: Some Top 100,000 Websites Collect Everything You Type -- Before

via ACM TechNews, 16 May 2022
Lily Hay Newman, *Ars Technica*, 14 May 2022

Researchers at Belgium's Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Radboud University
in the Netherlands, and Switzerland's University of Lausanne analyzed the
top 100,000 websites and found a significant number record some or all of
visitors' typewritten data. The researchers estimated 1,844 sites gathered a
European Union user's email address without consent, while 2,950 logged a
U.S. user's email. Many sites incorporate third-party marketing and
analytics services that perform data-logging. After crawling sites for
password leaks last May, the researchers found 52 sites in which third
parties, including Russian technology company Yandex, were incidentally
collecting password data prior to submission.

The Internet was delighted over the weekend when British history professor
Matthew McCormack made a hilarious discovery during his morning bike ride: a
six-wheeled delivery robot, driving by its lonesome self along a forested
path, in a rather adorable reminder of the helplessness of increasingly
ubiquitous autonomous machines.

Subject: AI Employment Systems may reflect various forms of bias
 (EEOC Warning)

Better now than later.

An interesting problem. There have been many well-documented cases of
scoring systems encapsulating pre-existing biases and gaps in understanding.

Twenty years ago, I spoke about the limitations of many analyses in "Les
Approximations Dangereaux: The Sorcerer's Apprentice and Other Dangerous
Approximations" at e_Protectit 2002.
(http://www.rlgsc.com/e-protectit/sorcerers.html)
A more extensive treatment is contained in Cathy O'Neil's 2016 book,
"Weapons of Math Destruction". Also relevant is Lawrence Lessig's 2000 book
"Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace".

Employment screening is no different than any other analysis. "Set", in
essence, seeing what one wants is a long-known danger in the Intelligence,
engineering, and other communities. Screening systems, whether for
employment, creditworthiness (e.g., red-lining), parole (see O'Neil), or
other uses, are no different.

Subject: Russians plunder $5M farm vehicles from Ukraine -- to find they've
 been remotely disabled (CNN)

Russian troops in the occupied city of Melitopol have stolen all the
equipment from a farm equipment dealership - and shipped it to Chechnya,
according to a Ukrainian businessman in the area.

But after a journey of more than 700 miles, the thieves were unable to use
any of the equipment -- because it had been locked remotely.

In this clip by CNN, an Ukrainian drone operator describes how Russian
troops were able to track the Ukrainians' off-the-shelf Chinese-made drones,
trying to destroy their operators.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b166ecyNBCw&t=156s

In this situation, it's all incidental, as both sides are just using
whatever they can get; none of this was planned by the Chinese manufacturers
-- yet.  But military systems everywhere contain thousands of electronic
components; I doubt their operators can even guess where every chip came
from.

Eventually he realized that if he wrote a version of Bitcoin that had a
Turing-complete programming language, the network could deliver every
imaginable digital service, right out of the box. It didn't even have to
stop at financial applications. You could replicate Facebook, reassemble the
stock market, or even build completely digital corporations and run them
beyond the jurisdiction of any government entity. Once placed on a
blockchain, they would exist in an environment where software, data, and
financial assets interact without friction.
