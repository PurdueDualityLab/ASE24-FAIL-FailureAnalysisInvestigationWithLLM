Subject: A New Normal: Siberian heat wave is a 'warning cry' from the
  Arctic, climate scientists say (Reuters)

Pine trees are bursting into flames. Boggy peatlands are tinderbox dry. And
towns in northern Russia are sweltering under conditions more typical of the
tropics.

Reports of record-breaking Arctic heat -- registered at more than 100
Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) in the Siberian town of Verkhoyansk on June 20 --
are still being verified by the World Meteorological Organization. But even
without that confirmation, experts at the global weather agency are worried
by satellite images showing that much of the Russian Arctic is in the red.

That extreme heat is fanning the unusual extent of wildfires across the
remote, boreal forest and tundra that blankets northern Russia. Those
blazes have in turn ignited normally waterlogged peatlands.

Scientists fear the blazes are early signs of drier conditions to come,
with more frequent wildfires releasing stores of carbon from peatland and
forests that will increase the amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases in
the air.

Thomas Smith, an environmental geographer at the London School of Economics:
``This is what this heat wave is doing: It makes much more fuel available to
burn, not just vegetation, but the soil as well.  It's one of many vicious
circles that we see in the Arctic that exacerbate climate change.''

Satellite records for the region starting in 2003 suggest there has been a
dramatic jump in emissions from Arctic fires during just the last two
summers, with the combined emissions released in June 2019 and June 2020
greater than during all of the June months in 2003-2018 put together, Smith
said.

Atmospheric records dating back more than a century show Arctic air
temperatures also reaching new highs in recent years. That leads Smith to
believe the scale of the fires could be unprecedented as well.  ``What we're
seeing happening right now is the consequence of the past industrial
emissions.  What will happen in 40 years' time is already locked in.  We
can't do anything about that. That's why we should be concerned; it can only
get worse.''

Although peatland covers only 3% of the Earth's land surface, those
deposits contain twice as much carbon as all the world's forests together.

  Matter (Science Alert)

By making use of the 'spooky' laws behind quantum entanglement, physicists
think have found a way to make information leap between a pair of electrons
separated by distance.
<https://www.sciencealert.com/entanglement>

Teleporting fundamental states between photons massless particles of light
-- is quickly becoming old news, a trick we are still learning to exploit in
computing and encrypted communications technology.

<https://www.sciencealert.com/physicists-work-out-a-way-to-cram-more-information-into-quantum-messages>

But what the latest research has achieved is quantum teleportation between
particles of matter -- electrons -- something that could help connect
quantum computing with the more traditional electronic kind.
<https://www.sciencealert.com/quantum-computers>

"We provide evidence for 'entanglement swapping,' in which we create
entanglement between two electrons even though the particles never interact,
and 'quantum gate teleportation,' a potentially useful technique for quantum
computing using teleportation," says physicist John Nichol from the
University of Rochester in New York.
<https://www.sciencealert.com/entanglement>
<https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/quantum-teleportation-to-improve-quantum-computing-441352/>

"Our work shows that this can be done even without photons."

concept. [...]

Subject: California University Paid $1.14 Million After Ransomware Attack
  (Bloomberg)

The hackers encrypted data on servers inside the school of medicine, the
university said Friday. While researchers at UCSF are among those leading
coronavirus-related antibody testing, the attack didn't impede its
Covid-19 work, it said. The university is working with a team of
cybersecurity contractors to restore the hampered servers *soon*.

``The data that was encrypted is important to some of the academic work we
pursue as a university serving the public good.  We therefore made the
difficult decision to pay some portion of the ransom.''
<https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417911/update-it-security-incident-ucsf>.

The intrusion was detected as recently as June 1, and UCSF said the actors
were halted during the attack. Yet using malware known as Netwalker, the
hackers obtained and revealed data that prompted UCSF to engage in
ransomware negotiations, which ultimately followed with payment. [...]

Subject: Smells Fishy? The Fish That Prevent Iran From Hacking Israel's
  Water System (Yeshiva World)

Following Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel's civilian infrastructure by
its attempt to hack into Israel's water system to raise the chlorine to
dangerous levels, the National Cyber Directorate took responsibility for
protecting Israel's water system, *Channel 12 News* reported on Monday.
<https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/1866326/iran-tried-to-raise-chlorine-in-israels-water-to-perilous-levels-report-says.html>

The report added an intriguing detail about the protection of Israel's water
system -- the employment of dozens of fish in ensuring the safety of
Israel's water supply.

Twelve aquariums filled with drinking water at the Eshkol water purification
site in Be'er Sheva each house several fish who happily swim around as fish
do.  The fish are closely monitored 24/7 to ensure they stay happy and
healthy.  Even the slightest signs of changes in their behavior are regarded
as *fishy* by those responsible for the safety of Israel's drinking water.

* Have you ever been in a swimming pool and accidentally swallowed some of
  the water?
* Have you ever gotten sick from doing so?
* Have you ever been in a swimming pool where you could NOT smell and taste
  the chlorine?

Even if we assume a cyberattack could have raised chlorine "to dangerous
levels", Israeli citizens would have smelled and tasted it long before they
consumed enough to fall ill.  Something smells fishy indeed.

I can believe that there are fish who serve as canaries in the water
system's "coal mine", because there might be poisons that could be
introduced in more traditional ways.  But I don't buy the part about a
cyberattack trying to release chlorine to make people sick.

U.S. Constitution, Art. 1, Sect. 8, gives Congress the power "to promote the
Progress of Science and Useful arts, by securing, for ***limited*** Times,
to ***Authors*** and ***Inventors***, the exclusive Right to ***their***
respective Writings and Discoveries".

The meaning of 'limited' has been twisted by Disney to mean 'limited only by
the imagination of highly paid Hollywood lawyers'; by a curious coincidence,
the limit always gets extended whenever a Disney copyright is in danger of
expiration.

Copyright is currently "author's life plus 70 years" (or should that read
"Disney Company's life plus 70 years"?), so when, exactly, does the 'life'
of an AI end?

What could possibly go wrong?

Here's what Disney's own web site has to say:

  "We are working to endow computers and robots with many of the qualities
  long associated with living, thinking beings -- from perception and action
  to reasoning, problem solving, and even ***creativity***!  Here we are
  going beyond simply building the next generation of smart tools and are
  instead finding new ways to bring our treasured characters to ***life***."

  https://studios.disneyresearch.com/artificial-intelligence/

The plain meaning of 'their' in the Constitution is a *human* reference;
otherwise, the Constitution would have said 'its'.

PS.  The 'Trans Pacific Partnership', which Trump pulled out of the moment
he was sworn into office in 2017, would have taken copyright out of the
hands of Congress and placed it under the control of an international trade
organization.  Like a stopped clock, Trump happened to do the right thing
this one time.

Only Sort of.

These days, a mismatch between a headline and the body of the article is not
at all unusual.  It used to be that newspaper headlines were accurate,
albeit those in the "red top" tabloids in particular have always used a
unique form of grammar, but sadly, no longer.  Just the other day, a leading
British broadsheet headlined a mandatory requirement, but reduced that to a
"might have to" in the article itself; and throughout the past months the UK
media (and government) has referred to "Rules" in headlines, but then
qualified them lower down as being merely "guidance" and "advice".  Even
some UK police forces have been ignorant of the limits of the "Rules" and
have misapplied the law.  There is a strong argument of course in this
situation, that trading on the ignorance and laziness of Jo Public might not
be a "bad thing", but I suspect it's largely an accidental abuse of the
language (I'm thinking Hanlon's Razor).

Nevertheless, extreme headlines abound, and the very evident RISK is that
far too many people read no further than the big print (few read the
subheading, fewer still the first paragraphs of the article, and there seem
to be almost none at all who read "below the fold" ... and then they
re-broadcast the hyperbole on social media where it gains new life.

For over 300 years it's been said that: "A lie gets halfway around the world
before the truth has a chance to get its pants on" (or similar), and
Shakespeare had Puck say, in a Midsummer Night's Dream: "I'll put a girdle
round the Earth in forty minutes."  Today the "lie" travels around the globe
in 40 milliseconds, and is solidified by, and enhanced in, each retelling.

Subject: Scientists just beginning to understand the many health problems
  caused by COVID-19 (Reuters)

... some may have lingering effects on patients and health systems for years
to come, according to doctors and infectious disease experts.

Besides the respiratory issues that leave patients gasping for breath, the
virus that causes COVID-19 attacks many organ systems, in some cases causing
catastrophic damage.

``We thought this was only a respiratory virus. Turns out, it goes after the
pancreas. It goes after the heart. It goes after the liver, the brain, the
kidney and other organs. We didn't appreciate that in the beginning,''
said Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and director of the Scripps Research
Translational Institute in La Jolla, California.

In addition to respiratory distress, patients with COVID-19 can experience
blood clotting disorders that can lead to strokes, and extreme inflammation
that attacks multiple organ systems. The virus can also cause neurological
complications that range from headache, dizziness and loss of taste or
smell to seizures and confusion.

And recovery can be slow, incomplete and costly, with a huge impact on
quality of life.

The broad and diverse manifestations of COVID-19 are somewhat unique, said
Dr. Sadiya Khan, a cardiologist at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago.  [...]

> No time to check for dead recipients -- what could go wrong?

I would have hoped the WaPo would have better political and arithmetic
skills than this article shows.

The $1.4 billion that went to dead people sounds like a lot until you
remember that the total was $270 billion so we're talking about 0.5% of the
total. The point of the stimulus was to get money to people as quickly as
possible so that money generally went to the dead peoples' family members
who as likely as not were happy to have to to pay for rent, food, and all
the other stuff the stimulus was intended to support.

Imagine you're in an office in D.C., you know that as things stand you'll
send half a percent of the money to dead people, and it would take (making
up a number here) half a week to arrange to compare the payment file to the
death records. Knowing that you'll still send money to some dead people (the
records are always out of date since people die every day), is it worth the
extra delay to fix a half percent error when the law says to send the money
s "as rapidly as possible"? What would you say? I'd say of course not, ship
it.

My father died last year and he did indeed get a stimulus payment directly
into the estate's bank account, followed by a letter from the Leader to
<dad's name> DEC'D. We don't need it so it's sitting in the bank waiting to
see if they're going to take it back. If they don't, I'll send it to the
local food bank who can sure use the money.

IRS has access to Social Security Death Master File

But, quoting the article: However, IRS counsel determined they did not have
the legal authority to deny payments to people who had filed a return, even
if they were deceased at the time of payment.

...so it wasn't a technical problem or a week's potential delay, it was set
up to deliver improper payments. And WaPo columnist now advises against
recovering improper payments. Because ... well, that's not clear.

What's the arithmetic skills failure to which you refer? You're likely right
that family members appreciated incorrect payments. So, likely, do people
receiving undeserved tax refunds. A billion here, a billion there, out of
trillions here, trillions there, still amounts to substantial waste.

That seems opinion or perspective than arithmetic. A small percentage of a

waste. Paying people who weren't intended to be paid -- no matter how happy
they are to receive the payment -- is a waste.
