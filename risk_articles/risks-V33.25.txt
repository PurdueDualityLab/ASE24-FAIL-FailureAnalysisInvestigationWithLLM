"The product idea had been kicked around at Axon since at least 2019 and the
company has been working to try to figure out whether a drone with a Taser
was even a feasible idea. Over the last year, the company created
computer-generated art renderings to mock up a product design and conducted
an internal test to see if Taser darts -- which transmit an immobilizing
electric jolt -- could be fired from a flying drone, Smith said. He added
that he had discussed the possibility of developing such a product with the
ethics board."

Would Axon deploy this drone-tazerbot to patrol of their corporate HQ and
other facilities? Nuts!

Subject: Illumina Cybersecurity Vulnerability May Present Risks for Patient
 Results and Customer Networks: Letter to Health Care Providers *FDA)

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is informing laboratory
personnel and health care providers about a cybersecurity vulnerability
affecting software in the Illumina NextSeq 550Dx, the MiSeqDx, the NextSeq
500, NextSeq 550, MiSeq, iSeq, and MiniSeq, next generation sequencing
instruments. These instruments are medical devices that may be specified
either for clinical diagnostic use in sequencing a person's DNA or testing
for various genetic conditions, or for research use only (RUO). Some of
these instruments have a dual boot mode that allows a user to operate them
in either clinical diagnostic mode or RUO mode. Devices intended for RUO are
typically in a development stage and must be labeled “For Research Use
Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.” – though many laboratories may
be using them with tests for clinical diagnostic use.

The cybersecurity vulnerability affects the Local Run Manager (LRM)
software. An unauthorized user could exploit the vulnerability by:

* taking control of the instrument remotely;

* operating the system to alter settings, configurations, software, or data
  on the instrument or a customer's network; or

* impacting patient test results in the instruments intended for clinical
  diagnosis, including causing the instruments to provide no results or
  incorrect results, altered results, or a potential data breach.

Illumina has developed a software patch to protect against the exploitation
of this vulnerability and is working to provide a permanent software fix for
current and future instruments. The FDA wants laboratory personnel and
health care providers to be aware of the required actions to mitigate these
cybersecurity risks.  [...]

Subject: Voting Software Vulnerable in Some States (Kate Brumback)

Kate Brumback, Associated Press, 1 Jun 2022, via ACM TechNews, 1 Jun 2022

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) warned state
election officials that Dominion Voting Systems' electronic voting machines
contain software flaws that could be exploited if left unpatched. Although
there is no evidence the machines have been hacked to change election
results, the advisory discloses nine vulnerabilities, and recommends
safeguards to prevent or detect exploitation. Despite CISA executive
director Brandon Wales' statement that "states' standard election security
procedures would detect exploitation of these vulnerabilities, and in many
cases would prevent attempts entirely," the advisory seems to suggest those
efforts are inadequate. Advised mitigation strategies include application of
continued and enhanced "defensive measures to reduce the risk of
exploitation of these vulnerabilities" prior to every election. CISA also
urged aggressive pre- and post-election testing on the machines,
post-election audits, and having voters confirm the human-readable portion
on printed ballots.

Subject: Activists say cyber agency weakens voting tech advisory (AP News)

The nation's leading cybersecurity agency released a final version Friday of
an advisory it previously sent state officials on voting machine
vulnerabilities in Georgia and other states that voting integrity activists
say weakens a security recommendation on using barcodes to tally votes.

The advisory put out by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency, or CISA, has to do with vulnerabilities identified in Dominion
Voting Systems' ImageCast X touchscreen voting machines, which produce a
paper ballot or record votes electronically. The agency said that although
the vulnerabilities should be quickly mitigated, the agency ``has no
evidence that these vulnerabilities have been exploited in any elections.''

Dominion's systems have been unjustifiably attacked since the 2020 election
by people who embraced the false belief that the election was stolen from
former President Donald Trump. The company has filed defamation lawsuits in
response to incorrect and outrageous claims made by high-profile Trump
allies.

Subject: Microsoft Follina Vulnerability in Windows Can Be Exploited Through
 Office 365 (WiReD)

The company continues to downplay the severity of the Follina vulnerability,
which remains present in all supported versions of Windows.

The Follina vulnerability in a Windows support tool can be easily exploited
by a specially crafted Word document. The lure is outfitted with a remote
template that can retrieve a malicious HTML file and ultimately allow an
attacker to execute Powershell commands within Windows. Researchers note
that they would describe the bug as a "zero-day," or previously unknown
vulnerability, but Microsoft has not classified it as such.  [...]

With all this real-world exploitation, the question is whether the guidance
Microsoft has published so far is adequate and proportionate to the risk.

"Security teams could view Microsoft's nonchalant approach as a sign that
this is 'just another vulnerability,' which it most certainly is not," says
Jake Williams, director of cyber threat intelligence at the security firm
Scythe. "It's not clear why Microsoft continues to downplay this
vulnerability, especially while it's being actively exploited in the wild."

Subject: Same Symptom -- Different Cause? (TUMunich)

Technical University of Munich, Germany, 27 May 2022
via ACM TechNews, 1 Jun 2022

Scientists at Germany's Technical University of Munich (TUM) have developed
a machine learning algorithm to extract subtypes of illnesses from molecular
data. The Molecular Signatures using Biclustering (MoSBi) tool merges the
results of existing algorithms to acquire stronger, more precise clinical
subtype predictions, removing the need for time-consuming adjustment. "We
have developed a Web-based tool that permits online analysis of molecular
clinical data by practitioners without prior knowledge of bioinformatics,"
explained TUM's Josch Konstantin Pauling. Researchers can submit data to a
website for automated analysis, and use the results to interpret their
research. The team worked with colleagues at Germany's Max Planck Institute,
Technical University of Dresden, and Kiel University Clinic to apply MoSBi
to identify two potential biomarkers for progression to non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease.

Subject: Tech Experts Urge WashDC to Resist Cryptocurrency Industry's
 Influence (Scott Chipolina)

Scott Chipolina, *Financial Times*, 31 May 2022,
via ACM TechNews, 1 Jun 2022

A coalition of 26 leading computer scientists and academics has submitted a
letter to U.S. lawmakers urging a crackdown on cryptocurrency investments
and blockchain technology. The letter calls on major Senate figures "to
resist pressure from digital asset industry financiers, lobbyists, and
boosters to create a regulatory safe haven for these risky, flawed, and
unproven digital financial instruments." Signatory Bruce Schneier at Harvard
University said blockchain, contrary to advocates' assurances, is insecure
and not decentralized. Events like the recent implosion of the TerraUSD
stablecoin have rekindled worries about crypto's financial stability, while
letter signatory and former Microsoft engineer Miguel de Icaza argued, "The
computational power [of blockchain] is equivalent to what you could do in a
centralized way with a $100 computer."

Subject: China is looking for 'other Earths' to colonize (CGTN)

China has announced its first plans to search the stars for nearby habitable
planets that could one day expand humanity's "living space" across the Milky
Way.  If it gets funding, the telescope could launch as soon as 2026.

In the project, called Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES), officials
propose launching a 3.9-foot-aperture (1.2 meters) space telescope roughly
930,000 miles (1.5 million kilometers) to a gravitationally stable Lagrange
point between Earth and the Sun, according to the Chinese state-run news
service CGTN.  Lagrange points trek around the sun at exactly the same rate
as Earth does, meaning a craft at one of those points will remain the same
distance from our planet indefinitely.

Once at the L2 Lagrange point (which is also home to NASA's James Webb Space
Telescope, the CHES telescope will spend five years searching for habitable
worlds across the roughly 100 sun-like stars within 33 light-years (10
parsecs) of Earth. From this data, astronomers hope to spot Earth-size
*exoplanets* <https://www.livescience.com/what-are-exoplanets> that are
moving around their stars in similar orbits to our own -- a clue that these
potential "Earth 2.0's" may harbor water, and possibly even life.

"The discovery of the nearby habitable worlds will be a great breakthrough
for humankind, and will also help humans visit those Earth twins and expand
our living space in the future," Ji Jianghui, an astronomer at the Chinese
Academy of Sciences and the principal investigator of the CHES mission,
*told CGTN*, the website of the China Global Television Network. The
scientists say they hope to find roughly 50 Earth-like or super-Earth
exoplanets in their search.  [...]

  [What are risks?  It's likely to be hugely expensive.  It seems somewhat
  delusional and beyond rational thought, in light of needing mass transit
  over the light-years required for travel, although that would perhaps be
  limited to future government leaders wishing to escape.  The use of the
  word "nearby" in the trans-galactic sense is particularly amusing.  It's
  too late for an April Fool's posting, so perhaps it is actually being
  considered seriously.  <I wonder what Bill Cheswick (widely known as
  "CHES") might think of it.  He has always been a far-sighted thinker.>
