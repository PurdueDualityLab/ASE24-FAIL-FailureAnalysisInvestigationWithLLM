Subject: Groundbreaking new material 'could allow artificial intelligence to
  merge with the human brain' (The Independent)

Technology could enable new health diagnostics and achieve Elon Musk's
goal of integrating with artificial intelligence

Scientists have discovered a ground-breaking bio-synthetic material that
they claim can be used to merge artificial intelligence with the human
brain.

The breakthrough, presented today at the American Chemical Society Fall
2020 virtual expo, is a major step towards integrating electronics with the
body to create part human, part robotic "cyborg" beings.

Connecting electronics to human tissue has been a major challenge due to
traditional materials like gold, silicon and steel causing scarring when
implanted.

Scars not only cause damage but also interrupt electrical signals flowing
between computers and muscle or brain tissue. The researchers from the
University of Delaware were able to overcome this after various types of
polymers.  [...]

Subject: What would happen to Earth if humans went extinct? (Live Science)

*Nature always finds a way*

Deep within Guatemala's rainforest sits one of the most famous remnants of
the *Maya* <https://www.livescience.com/41781-the-maya.html> civilization: a
roughly 2,000-year-old citadel turned to ruins called *Tikal*
<https://www.livescience.com/23479-tikal-mayan-civilization.html>. When Alan
Weisman hiked through the surrounding region, he discovered something
fascinating along the way: "You're walking through this really dense
rainforest, and you're walking over hills," said Weisman, author and
journalist. "And the archaeologists are explaining to you that what you're
really walking over are pyramids and cities that haven't been excavated."

In other words, we know about sites like Tikal because humans have gone to
great efforts to dig up and restore their remains. Meanwhile, countless
other ruins remain hidden, sealed beneath forest and earth. "It's just
amazingly thrilling how fast nature can bury us," Weisman told *Live
Science*.

This scene from the rainforest allows us a glimpse of what our planet could
look like, if humans simply stopped existing. Lately, that idea has been
especially pertinent, as the global COVID-19 *pandemic*
<https://www.livescience.com/pandemic.html> has kept people inside, and
emboldened animals to return to our quieter urban environments -- giving us
a sense of what life might look like if we retreated further into the
background. Weisman, who wrote "The World Without Us" (Thomas Dunne Books,
2007), spent several years interviewing experts and systematically
investigating this question: What would happen to our planet -- to our
cities, to our industries, to nature -- if humans disappeared?

*A different kind of skyline*.  [...]

BIO-UPGRADABLE: Meet the super-rich biohackers turning into cyborgs
  with in-built armour and injecting teenagers' *blood* to stay young

>From daily sessions in sub-zero cryo-chambers to stem cell injection and
transfusions of teenagers' blood, their bizarre attempts to become
superhuman have fueled a multi-million dollar industry.

It may sound like something out of a sci-fi novel, but there's a growing
band of Silicon Valley billionaires who believe they can achieve eternal
life through *biohacking* -- the process of making alterations to your body
to keep it younger.

Netflix's new drama Biohackers, released on Thursday, (20 Aug) seizes on the
terrifying trend by imagining a secretive lab where a young student, played
by Luna Wedler, discovers a sinister experiment using the techniques on an
entire town.

Here we meet the real Silicon Valley biohackers - the men who want to be
immortal.  [...]

Subject: A typo created a 212-story monolith in Microsoft Flight Simulator
  (Engadget)

Flight Simulator users recently found an unusual landmark: a 212-story
monolith towering over an otherwise nondescript suburb in Melbourne,
Australia.

After some sleuthing, the title's community found what had caused the tower
to appear in Flight Simulator. When developer Asobo Studio built its
detailed recreation of the globe, they pulled data from OpenStreetMap, a
free map of the world to which anyone can contribute.  About a year ago, a
user named nathanwright120 added a tag that said this one building in
Melbourne had 212 floors instead of two. Based on their other contributions,
it appears the edit was a simple typo, not them trying to mislead
anyone. The error was later corrected by another OpenStreetMap contributor,
but not before it made its way into Flight Simulator.

Subject: Microsoft Put Off Fixing Zero Day for 2 Years (Krebs on Security)

A security flaw in the way *Microsoft Windows* guards users against
malicious files was actively exploited in malware attacks for two years
before last week, when Microsoft finally issued a software update to correct
the problem.

One of the 120 security holes Microsoft fixed on the 11 Aug Patch Tuesday
[NOTED IN RISKS-32.20. PGN] was CVE-2020-1464, a problem with the way every
supported version of Windows validates digital signatures for computer
programs.
<https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-patch-tuesday-august-2020-edition/>
<https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1464>

Code signing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_signing> is the method of
using a certificate-based digital signature to sign executable files and
scripts in order to verify the author's identity and ensure that the code
has not been changed or corrupted since it was signed by the author.

Microsoft said an attacker could use this spoofing vulnerability to bypass
security features intended to prevent improperly signed files from being
loaded. Microsoft's advisory makes no mention of security researchers having
told the company about the flaw, which Microsoft acknowledged was actively
being exploited.  [...]

Subject: "Driverless cars are coming soon." (The Telegraph)

Old news for RISKS readers, but just announced in the UK.

Driverless cars are coming soon, and will bring a host of ethical and
moral dilemmas with them

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/comment/driverless-cars-coming-soon-will-bring-host-ethical-moral-dilemmas/

  A driverless future is not far away, but what are the implications for
  passengers and pedestrians?

  Whether drivers like them or not, autonomous cars are coming soon to a
  road near you. Well, actually, they are already here.  Many modern
  vehicles have the ability to 'see' white lines, kerbs, pedestrians, other
  cars and obstacles, and can steer, brake and accelerate in accordance with
  the road and surrounding traffic.  They already have all the hardware
  needed for Level 3 autonomy (although a software update would likely be
  needed before it could be fully activated) but legislation prohibits the
  use of it.  Currently, a driver must be in control of the vehicle at all
  times regardless of how clever the vehicle's autonomous systems may be.
  That could be about to change. Ministers in the UK are considering plans
  that could see drivers being allowed to take their hands off the wheel in
  Level 3 autonomous cars, as early as next spring.

This is what puzzles me.  When I'm driving a car, the driving takes my full
attention (I have to explain to passengers that my conversation may be a
little erratic), whereas if I'm a passenger then I try to avoid looking at
the road so as not to be a mental back-seat driver.  If I'm riding in an
autonomous vehicle, I would have difficulty in keeping close-enough
attention to be able to take over instantly if needed.  If I have a crash,
who is liable?

One example that springs to mind is if the car was approaching a red traffic
light; I would initially assume that the car will stop, but if it doesn't, I
may not realise until it's too late.

Subject: Tokyo's latest attraction: Transparent public toilets (cnn.com)

https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/tokyo-toilet-project-transparent-toilets/index.html

Light valves control opacity electrically or optically. When not energized,
the valve is dark.

Energize the valve to expose the toilet interior when the door is unlocked.

Lock the door to power-down the valve, and the walls darken in ~1-3 seconds.

Not hard to imagine a lock bypass when occupied. There might be a backup
interlock using an motion detector to defeat door lock shorts/bypasses.

Doubt this prank would arise in Tokyo given civility and group cohesion.
Regardless of culture or country, an uneventful bio-break should be a
guaranteed human right.

Subject:  DC No Longer Has Online Voter Registration (DCist)

But as Jackson, 27, tried to use the app and its companion portal online,
neither would work. And he soon learned why: In a move that wasn't widely
publicized, the D.C. Board of Elections recently discontinued the
long-troubled app, killing the only means for residents to register online
to vote in the process.  ``I was just frustrated that there was no
information online.  There was no clear communication.''

Election officials say the app was notoriously buggy and no longer
reliable. And they concede it isn't likely that the elections board will be
able to roll out a new app before the Nov. 3 election, potentially making it
more difficult for new residents to register to vote or for existing voters
to change their information.  ``We are working to identify a new possible
vendor, but significant testing would need to be done prior to launch, and
weâ€™re not sure this will be doable before the general [election],'' said
Rachel Coll, a spokeswoman for the elections board, in an email.  ``We're
actively looking, though.''

Subject: U.S. COVID-19 and World War 2 mortality rates, interim comparison

  [Note: I undertook this historical comparison out of curiosity. I am not
  an epidemiologist. The calculations yield average mortality rate measures
  based on accumulated public epidemiological reports and historical US
  government sources.]

COVID-19 represents a mortal threat, analogous to an enemy combatant in
battle.

nUS involvement in World War 2, per Congressional Research Service (see
https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL32492.pdf), identifies 291,557 battle
deaths between 07DEC1941 and 14AUG1945 (192 weeks and 2 days). Total deaths
are much higher: 405,399 (which includes 113,842 "Other Deaths" arising from
accidents, disease, and infections).

The arithmetic yields: 291,557 battle deaths/192.29 weeks ~= 1516 battle
deaths per week.

Since 22JAN2020 until 18AUG2020 (29 weeks, 6 days), Johns Hopkins
(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases active since 22JAN2020, see
US tracker) reports 170,584 deaths from COVID-19.

These casualty rate figures shock my senses.

Consider the reporting time interval ratio (COVID-19 29.86 weeks/WW2
192.29 weeks) ~= 0.16, or ~1/6th the total duration of World War 2.

The ratio of COVID-19 to WW2 battle deaths per week: 5712/1516 ~= 3.77.

The casualty rate ratio shatters my senses!

Without a viable and effective vaccine, the US COVID-19 casualty risk will
accumulate until effective disease prophylactic measures are adopted and
applied with civility.
