Subject: What Is CoolSculpting? (New York Times)

https://www.nytimes.com/article/cool-sculpting.html

"The fat-freezing procedure left supermodel Linda Evangelista 'disfigured.'
Here's what experts say it is supposed to do and what the most common side
effects are."

The report contained this statement of interest:

"More than eight million CoolSculpting treatments had been administered in
the U.S. as of 2019, according to the CoolSculpting website. The American
Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery reports that board-certified U.S.
plastic surgeons performed 129,686 nonsurgical fat-reducing treatments in
2019, a category that includes CoolSculpting as well as treatments that use
ultrasound to kill fat cells. But those numbers do not reflect CoolSculpting
treatments done by dermatologists, so the real number is probably much
higher."

The FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health collects and reports
adverse events for medical devices, but does not collect, compile, and
report regulated device usage/treatment count information.  The device
usage/treatment count reporting deficit creates opacity that exploits
consumer expectation.

https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfTPLC/tplc.cfm?id=6012
(retrieved on 26SEP2021) itemizes and categorizes these adverse events from
01JAN2016 to 31AUG2021 for product code OOK. One can examine the medical
device reports attributed to device and patient problems for the
CoolSculpting machine.

See this for the 455 patient problem reports attributed to hyperplasia:
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/results.cfm?start_search=1&searchyear=&productcode=OOK&patientproblem=1906&devicename=&knumber=k&pmanumber=p&manufacturer=&brandname=&eventtype=&reportdatefrom=01/1/2016&reportdateto=&pagenum=10

A worldwide recall for ~860 CoolSculpting devices has been issued by Deltiq
Aesthetics (see
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfres/res.cfm?start_search=1&event_id=88397,
retrieved on 26SEP2021).

The recall notice lists what FDA identifies as a software design error.  The
manufacturer's recall justification says, "An incorrect error messaging
system that could potentially lead to: 1) Reporting a thermal event error
causing a user to re-treating the affected anatomic area within 24 hours, 2)
Not reporting a thermal event or any other error codes causing a user to
continue treating without being aware that a thermal event has occurred."

Why did a celebrity's treatment-induced hyperplasia event and subsequent
law suit apparently initiate the device recall when more than 400 prior
reports probably preceded it?

Risk: Cosmetic therapy medical device software.

Subject: Tesla owners can now request ‚ÄòFull Self-Driving‚Äô, prompting
 criticism from regulators and safety advocates (MSN)

Tesla began letting owners request its ‚ÄúFull Self-Driving‚Äù software early
Saturday, opening up for wide release its most advanced driver-assistance
suite and signaling that thousands of drivers will soon be on the road with
the unregulated and largely untested features.

It‚Äôs the first time the company has let typical owners upgrade to the
software it terms self-driving, although the name itself is an exaggeration
by industry and regulatory standards. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk had
said owners would be able to request this weekend the upgraded suite of
advanced driver-assistance features, which Tesla says is a beta, although
they wouldn‚Äôt receive the capabilities right away.

Owners will have to agree to let Tesla monitor their driving behavior
through the company insurance calculator. Tesla issued a detailed guide
specifying the criteria under which drivers would be graded. If their
driving is deemed to be ‚Äúgood‚Äù over a seven-day period, Musk said on
Twitter, ‚Äúbeta access will be granted.‚Äù

It‚Äôs the latest twist in a saga that has regulators, safety advocates and
relatives of Tesla crash victims up in arms because of the potential for
chaos as the technology is unleashed on real-world roads. Until now,
roughly 2,000 beta testers have had access to the technology.  [...]

  [Reply from Jay Fenello <jay@fenello.com>:
  This is very dangerous given Tesla's decision to *not* use any type of
  distance measuring technology (sonar, radar, lidar) other than cameras and
  AI.  PGN]

Subject: Chip makers to carmakers: time to get out of the semiconductor
 Stone Age (Fortune)

When it comes to the electronic circuits that power our everyday lives,
the automobile is simultaneously the world‚Äôs most expensive consumer
good and the one that runs on the cheapest possible semiconductor chips.

Moore‚Äôs law of ever-increasing miniaturization seemingly never reached
the automotive industry. Dozens of chips found in everything from
electronic brake systems to airbag control units tend to rely on
obsolete technology often well over a decade old. These employ
comparatively simple transistors that can be anywhere from 45 nanometers
to as much as 90 nanometers in size, far too large‚Äîand too primitive‚Äîto
be suitable for today‚Äôs smartphones.

When the pandemic hit, replacement demand for big-ticket items like new
cars was pushed back while sales of all kinds of home devices soared.
When the car market roared back months later, chipmakers had already
reallocated their capacity.

Now these processors are in short supply, and chipmakers are telling car
companies to wake up and finally join the 2010s.

Subject: Portpass app may have exposed hundreds of thousands of users'
 personal data (CBC)

Alberta's premier, Jason Kenney, has steadfastly refused to implement any
sort of COVID vaccine "passport" (air bunnies because I find the term
muddled) out of some kind of misplaced sense of libertarianism.  So, along
with an explosion of Delta infections -- mostly among the unvaccinated, of
course -- worthy of the American south, here's what we get:

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/portpass-privacy-breach-1.6191749

The RISK: Where governments abdicate their responsibility to take reasonable
and necessary measures, incompetent opportunists will surely step into the
void.

Subject: How close is nuclear fusion power? (Sabine Hossenfelder)

How close is nuclear fusion to break-even? If you trust the headlines we're
getting close and the international project ITER is going to be the first to
produce energy from fusion power. But not so fast. Scientists have,
accidentally or deliberately, come to use a very misleading quantity to
measure their progress. Unfortunately we're much farther away from
generating fusion power than the headlines suggest...üë¬á

How sustainable altcoins aim to challenge Bitcoin's dominance

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs becoming pretty clear that Bitcoin is either ignoring or making
excuses for the environmental issues it‚Äôs having,‚Äù Jameson, who now heads up
operations at Flashbots, told Fortune.

Over the past dozen years, the cryptocurrency community has largely hummed
along to the deafening sounds of mining rigs while Bitcoin‚Äôs energy usage
has ballooned along with its price. The original cryptocurrency now uses
about the same amount of electricity in a year as Poland, with a carbon
footprint comparable to that of Oman, according to Digiconomist, which
tracks Bitcoin‚Äôs energy consumption.  [...\

‚ÄúWe will do for sustainability what Robinhood did for equities in that we
will create access for millions of people who want to put their own
discretionary investment income into investment opportunities that have a
market rate of return and that align with their values,‚Äù Carver said.

Subject: Elevator-Pitch Privacy

A friend reports that his father was ascending a retirement community's
elevator when a mechanical-sounding voice surprisingly intoned that "your
warranty has expired." After initially thinking this was about the elevator
warranty, his father remembered hearing those exact words and tone and
surmised that it was a robocall for a vehicle maintenance extension sales
pitch. He relates that at least one retirement community employee, who
reported a similar incident, was chided by supervisors and colleagues who
didn't believe her claims that the elevator spoke.

Elevators in the U.S. must possess emergency communication devices, often
telephony-based. Authorized elevator maintenance personnel likely use them
to perform remote status inquiries. In this case, a robocaller sequence
reached the elevator's unpublished emergency phone number to promote
warranty extensions.

An elevator's emergency phone answers automatically and silently to
establish a two-way communications link and to allow quick audio evaluation
of conditions after a potential emergency, when occupants may be unable to
speak. A web search for "elevator telephone products" reveals numerous 3rd
party offerings. Your lift might be listening, possibly matching voice
prints for law enforcement, surveillance, or monetizing the conversation.

Risk: Elevator-pitch privacy and potential disruption of true emergency
communications.

It is unknown whether or not elevator controls, sensors, displays are
accessible/exploitable through the emergency telephone.  Hopefully not!

Reported by BBC (https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58719891) and many UK
sources.

"Apple told the BBC: "We take any threat to users' security very
seriously. This is a concern with a Visa system but Visa does not believe
this kind of fraud is likely to take place in the real world given the
multiple layers of security in place"

The biggest risk applies to stolen iPhones with a Visa Card set in Transit
Mode.
