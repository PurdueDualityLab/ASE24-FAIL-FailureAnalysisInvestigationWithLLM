  Nicole Perlroth
  This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends:
    The Cyberweapons Arms Race
  Bloomsbury, 2021

This book is "The untold story of the cyberweapons market -- the most
secretive, invisible, government-backed market on earth -- and a terrifying
first look at a new kind of global warfare."

Nicole Perlroth's new book will be a treasure chest for many RISKS readers.
Although it focuses on information warfare, it does so in the context of
much deeper issues relating to computer security and privacy.  It includes
details of many topics that have appeared here -- as well as in-depth
coverage of many nevertheless RISKS-relevant items that have not.  The title
might seem a little presumptuous at first glance, but the book lives up to
the title's expectations, and is right on the button (no pun intended).
Indeed, considering its publication date (next Tuesday), it is amazingly
up-to-date -- including some recent events earlier this year.  She has
wisely used her role of pursuing these topics for *The New York Times* in
recent years, and has written a far-reaching book that digs deeply into its
sources.  I'm sure it will inspire some considerable further discussion for
those of you who read it.

Jill Lepore has written an outstanding four-page review: *Zero Day: Hacking
the Whole World*, which appears in the current *The New Yorker*, 8 Feb 2021,
pp. 55--58.  I commend to you both Nicole Perlroth's book

Subject: Google uncovers new iOS security feature Apple quietly added
  after zero-day attacks

Google Project Zero on Thursday disclosed details of a new security
mechanism that Apple quietly added to iOS 14 as a countermeasure to prevent
attacks that were recently found to leverage zero-days in its messaging app.

Dubbed "BlastDoor," the improved sandbox system for iMessage data was
disclosed by Samuel Gro=C3=9F, a security researcher with Project Zero, a
team of security researchers at Google tasked with studying zero-day
vulnerabilities in hardware and software systems.

"One of the major changes in iOS 14 is the introduction of a new, tightly
sandboxed 'BlastDoor' service which is now responsible for almost all
parsing of untrusted data in iMessages," Gro=C3=9F said
<https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/01/a-look-at-imessage-in-ios-14.html>.
"Furthermore, this service is written in Swift, a (mostly) memory safe
language which makes it significantly harder to introduce classic memory
corruption vulnerabilities into the code base."

The development is a consequence of a *zero-click exploit
<https://thehackernews.com/2020/12/iphones-of-36-journalists-hacked-using.html>
that leveraged an Apple iMessage flaw in iOS 13.5.1 to get around security
protections as part of a cyberespionage campaign targeting Al Jazeera
journalists last year.  [...]

Subject: NASA's space junk problem (Axios)

NASA needs to do more to understand the risks posed to spacecraft by space
junk and find new ways to mitigate the threat, according to a report last
week from the Office of Inspector General.
<https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-21-011.pdf>

Why it matters: Some see space junk as an environmental crisis in orbit.
<https://www.axios.com/space-looming-space-junk-environmentalism-cb3b0c15-1=
bb7-43fb-a1de-f9a6334d601e.html>
Millions of pieces of space debris speed around Earth at more than 17,000
mph, putting spacecraft and sometimes people in harm=99s way.

Driving the news: The new OIG report suggests that while NASA has done a
good job of deorbiting its own spacecraft and rocket bodies, many other
nations haven't been as proactive, launching spacecraft and rockets that
stay in orbit longer than the 25 years recommended.

   - Now experts warn the space agency will need to both mitigate the junk
   already in space and prevent future junk from being created to keep
   spacecraft safe in the future.
   - "Despite presidential and congressional directives to NASA over the
   past decade to develop active debris removal technologies, the Agency ha=
s
   made little to no progress on such efforts," the OIG wrote.
   - The OIG also recommended NASA should develop a better means of
   tracking and understanding the nature of space junk in orbit to more
   effectively protect its spacecraft.

The catch: Nations and private companies are working to find ways to
effectively
clean up space
<https://www.axios.com/space-junk-satellite-janitors-bdf897f3-81ac-40b8-b94=

Subject: AI Can Tell What Song You Are Listening to From Your Brainwaves
  (Matthew Sparkes)

Matthew Sparkes, *New Scientist* 26 Jan 2021, via ACM TechNews, 1 Feb 2021

Artificial intelligence (AI) developed by researchers at Delft University of
Technology in the Netherlands can identify the songs a person is listening
to by examining their brainwaves. The researchers used an
electroencephalography (EEG) cap that detects the brain's electrical
activity to record the brainwaves of 20 test subjects as they listened to 12
songs through headphones while blindfolded in a dimly lit room. The AI was
trained using short segments of each person's EEG readings along with the
matching music clip to identify patterns, and identified the songs with 85%
accuracy in tests on unseen portions of the data. However, accuracy fell
below 10% when the AI was trained on EEG data from one person and then
sought to identify a song when a different person listened to it. Said
Delft's Derek Lomas, music is "just voltage fluctuations. And it's the same
with the EEG."

  --  if You Have an Apple Watch (WiReD)

Recognizing you while your face is covered is still pretty tough for a
computer.

Apple is facing our face-masked future. This week, the company started
testing some new software for the iPhone that will let device owners unlock
the handset while wearing a face covering. There's a catch, though, one that
lines up with Apple's strategy of locking people in to different Apple
products, and it highlights how challenging it can be to develop accurate
facial recognition technology: The new face-unlock feature requires an Apple
Watch.

The first developer beta of iOS 14.5 includes updates to app tracking
controls and Siri alongside the face-mask function. App-makers typically get
early access to the newest version of iOS in order to launch or retool their
apps well in advance of the formal software release. (Brave souls who don't
mind the risk of potentially bricking their iPhones can also enroll in
public beta releases.) The fully baked version of the software is expected
to be made available to the general public this spring.

University of Warwick (UK), 27 Jan 2021 via ACM TechNews 3 Feb 2021

Researchers at the U.K.'s University of Warwick, Canada's University of
Ottawa, and France's Paris School of Economics and Aix-Marseille University
found that Google Trends data from 10 countries across Europe and the U.S.
between January 2019 and April 2020 demonstrated the impact of pandemic
lockdowns on mental health. The researchers observed a sharp increase in the
number of people searching on Google for terms related to boredom,
loneliness, and worry at the beginning of the first lockdown. Said the
University of Warwick's Nick Powdthavee, "Our findings indicate that
people's mental health may have been severely affected by the pandemic and
lockdown." Powdthavee added, "It may be necessary to make sure support is
provided to help those struggling most with lockdown."

Anthony Capaccio, *Bloomberg*, 2 Feb 2021 via ACM TechNews 3 Feb 2021

The Pentagon is consulting with U.S. universities to evaluate software on
aerospace company Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jet, in the hope of
correcting the buggy system. The F-35 program's Laura Seal said software
experts at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, the
Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute, and the Georgia
Institute of Technology Research Institute are conducting an independent
technical assessment. The $398-billion F-35 program involves Lockheed
fighter jets equipped with more than 8 million lines of code each. Seal said
the program office will analyze the assessment as part of "a broad range of
information," then announce dates for program milestones, including
simulated combat testing to rate the F-35's performance against the latest
Russian and Chinese aircraft and air defenses.

  Pass May Be Inactive (DCist)

The commonwealth is one of two states (New Hampshire is the other) that
deactivates drivers' passes and closes their accounts after a year of
inactivity. This is due to the requirements of the state's unclaimed
property regulations. With routines upended, many commuters would likely see
their passes approach expiration come mid-March.

But now, drivers have until the summer to avoid losing their pass's
functionality. The Virginia Treasury Department has given the Virginia
Department of Transportation (VDOT) a one-time, six-month moratorium on the
deactivation rule because of the pandemic.

There is a serious problem with the regulation of short selling, which has
been going on for most of my 70+ years: you're not allowed to sell short
shares that you haven't *borrowed*. This keeps the total number of shares
shorted at less than the total number of shares in the public market (the
"float").

However, some of the companies mentioned in these articles have had total
shorted shares substantially greater than the total number of shares in the
company, which proves that someone (actually, a large # of someone's) have
been illegally rigging the system.

The SEC claims to be looking into this whole situation, but I'm not holding

More recently the (now ex-)commissioner of the Department of Building

I have to suspect automated check processing made this easier, as humans

I was of the same opinion as WOL along the lines that IF the first dose of
the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine provides 60% protection (for twice as many
people) and 100% protection against serious illness, it's a no-brainer from
the epidemiological standpoint- if not for those individuals who would
otherwise receive their second dose after 3 weeks.

However Dr Fauci's statement that providing 60% protection to a large
population would/could select for mutations with immunity to the vaccine
adds a new level of complexity.

https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-coronavirus-variant-mutation-2nd-vaccine-dose-covid-2021-1

Fauci, speaking on a virtual World Economic Forum panel:
"You don't get full efficacy until you get the second dose, and if you allow
suboptimal efficacy, you can actually immunologically select for mutations,"

But England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty:
  a "real worry but quite a small real worry".

Subject: Risk analysis and CoVID variants

Right now, people are in a major panic about CoVID variants.  B1.1.7 (aka
UK), B1.351 (aka South Africa), CAL20C, and at least one from Brazil.  By
the time you read this, there will likely be others.

CoVID is a really classic example of risk because so much probability is
involved.  As Donn Parker has famously said, there is no risk of
encountering malware because, in the current computing environment there is
no probability of encountering malware: it's a certainty.  Almost none of
the CoVID risk is binary.  If you leave your house, you don't necessarily
immediately get CoVID, it just increases the probability of your risk of
getting infected.  If you fail to wash your hands, you don't immediately get
CoVID, it just increases the probability of your risk of getting infected.
If you stand less than two metres away from someone, you don't immediately
get CoVID, it just increases the probability of your risk of getting
infected.  If you don't wear a mask when you go out, you don't immediately
get CoVID, it just increases the probability of your risk of getting
infected.

And, if you do get infected, there is probability involved again.  You may
never show any symptoms.  Or you may have something like a mild case of the
flu.  Or you may die.  Or you may just become really, really sick, and, for
a month or so, *wish* you would die.  Or you may become one of the
long-haulers with some weird respiratory or neurological deficit that never
goes away.  It's a fairly random outcome, as far as we can tell at the
moment.

But there's more probability involved, and almost nobody is talking about
it.  Each time the virus reproduces, there is a chance of an error.  Those
errors become mutations.  Most of the time, the mutation simply fails.  The
error causes the virus to fail to reproduce, or sometimes to fall apart.
(Those mutations just disappear.)  Sometimes the error doesn't really change
much of anything, and it just makes it possible for us humans to do full
genome sequencing and figure out where this particular case of CoVID came
from.  But sometimes, say once in 85.4 trillion times, the error produces
something that will make the virus work slightly better than it did before.
It may bind more tightly to human cells, or hide a bit better from
antibodies.  It'll be more successful.

A more successful virus will tend to have an advantage, and will therefore
sort of take over the niche that the viruses are trying to occupy, just like
any other evolutionary population dynamics.  If the new mutation is more
successful because it infects faster or easier, then the variant will spread
faster, and the new variant will be more infectious than the old variant,
thus increasing the reproductive number and increasing the number of cases
per day.  But that's ironic, because each new case provides more opportunity
for mutation.  Each time the virus reproduces there is room for that error,
and so each and every new case means a greater risk of more variants.

Which means that every time you go out when you don't need to, or fail to
wash your hands, or fail to distance, or fail to wear a mask, you not only
risk getting infected, or giving the infection to your friends and family,
or increasing the spread in your neighbour, but you also risk making a new
variant, each one closer to the ultimate aim of the viruses to become
something that infects everyone it contacts immediately, spreads via tiny
aerosols that go right through filters, completely spreads through the
entire organism, and then sits and does nothing and produces no detectable
symptoms until a month after infection when it kills everyone.

Now, lest you think that is too dark a thought in regard to virus variants,
note that, right now, even with the variants that we have encountered, we
*do* know how to deal with them.  We need to do exactly what we have been
told all along, only more so.  Stay home if you can.  Wash your hands.  If
you need to go out, keep your distance.  If you need to go out, wear a mask.
Don't go to parties.  Don't hold parties.  No, not even SuperBowl parties.
Don't merge bubbles.  This is not rocket science.  And it works.

Subject: A new bio-inspired joint model to design robotic exoskeletons
  (Techxplore.com)

https://techxplore.com/news/2021-02-bio-inspired-joint-robotic-exoskeletons.html

"Recent advances in the field of robotics have enabled the fabrication of
increasingly sophisticated robotic limbs and exoskeletons. Robotic
exoskeletons are essentially wearable 'shells' made of different robotic
parts. Exoskeletons can improve the strength, capabilities and stability of
users, helping them to tackle heavy physical tasks with less effort or
aiding their rehabilitation after accidents."

A fascinating field ripe for innovation. No ready means to determine the
deployed product population. See some exoskeleton models:
https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/robot-exosuit-roundup/

These systems can enable a paraplegic to ambulate. However, the limb motion
control systems can injure human anatomy.

The FDA's TPLC platform lists one product code, PHL, that categorizes
regulations for powered exoskeletons, specifically "powered lower extremity
exoskeleton."

See
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfTPLC/tplc.cfm?id=3931&min_report_year=2016.
There are 20 medical device reports listed between 2016-2020. The key

Subject: Series of security lectures

Oh, my brothers and only friends:

I have been presented with an opportunity to give a whole series of
presentations to a *non*-security group.  We, as security people, always
complain that nobody in tech ever wants to listen to us, so I am not about
to turn down an opportunity for an eight-month gig to evangelize our
non-security bretheren.

VanTUG ( http://vantug.com/ ) started life as a Microsoft user group, so
they want me to use Microsoft Teams, which I never have.  I am still
learning.  Some things I like, and some I don't.  The VanTUG President has
told me that they are willing to have non-members attend the
"meetings"/lectures, or to join the group.  There is no charge for either
membership or attendance.  You can join the VanTUG "Team" at
https://teams.microsoft.com/join/r7slh6566c60.  It is not necessary to join
in order to attend the "meetings"/lectures, but joining gets you
announcements about the meetings.  Or you can view the postings I'm making
at https://community.isc2.org/t5/C/V/m-p/42919 or follow my Twitter feed at
https://twitter.com/rslade

The first of these presentations is going to be on this Tuesday, February
2nd, and the first and third Tuesdays of the month thereafter, currently
slated to run until September. The meetings are from 7 pm to 8:30 pm ET:
Vancouver).  A (rough) list of topics can be found at the posting at
https://community.isc2.org/t5/C/V/m-p/42919

The link for the first "meeting" is:
https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MGNlNjNhMGItNzVjNC00NDk3LThmNDUtNDE3MjZlN2RmOTVh%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%228d3d8493-09a7-43f8-97e6-9423036fdf31%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22055a3565-22c2-4d78-a9f2-e72f723df6ef%22%7d
It might be easier to get it off the posting at
https://community.isc2.org/t5/C/V/m-p/42919 or my Twitter feed at
https://twitter.com/rslade

So, if you are interested, or if you want to see "Teams" in action, or if
you have any non-security friends that you want to be evangelized into
security, or want to attend and heckle me when I make a mistake in what I
tell them ...
