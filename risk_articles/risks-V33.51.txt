Subject: Ground Truth vs Ground-up Truth

It's time for a little levity after months of ugly campaign disinformation
and gigantic fund-raising efforts in the U.S.  I offer this limerick, and
beg your indulgence.

     Relections on the U.S. Midterm Election Campaigns
        Peter G. Neumann (a.k.a. Lim[b]erRick),
        Election Day, 8 November 2022

      There once was a notion of "ground truth",
      Which the DNA linked up with "found tooth".
        But old farts with no heart
        Took the ground truth apart,
      While leaving the future to "frowned youth".

   [Your choice of alternatives in the last line:
    crowned, gowned, sound, bound, towned, ...  I liked "frowned" <upon>]

   old fart:
     Tribal elder.  A title self-assumed with remarkable frequency ...
     This is a term of insult in the second or third person, but one of
     pride in first person.

   "Ground Truth" is becoming like Ground-up Meat --
   You have no idea what it entails (or entrails?).
   Are the contents just FAKE NEWS?  or REALLY-FAKE NEWS?

An earlier draft version of my doggerel had the last line as:
  "Forsooth" took the meaning of "found truth".

  forsooth [WordNet]
    adv 1: an archaic word originally meaning *in truth* but now
           usually used to express *disbelief* [emphasis mine]

  forsooth  formerly used as
     An expression of deference or respect, especially to woman;
     now used ironically or contemptuously.
     [1913 Webster]

     Our old English word "forsooth" has been changed for the French
     madam.  -- Guardian.
     [1913 Webster]

  Dad-to-Kid-joke:
   Diner: Waiter, This coffee tastes like mud.
   Waiter: It should.  It was *GROUND* this morning.

Jack Nicas, *The New York Times*, 6 Nov 2022

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/05/world/americas/brazil-election-us-democracy.html

Given that there are no computer systems that cannot be hacked through
unsecure hardware, software, and apps, *and* the reality that the federal
government cannot control state elections -- which the existing Supreme
Court would pretty much guarantee -- there are no realistic solutions.  The
research community understands some of the machine-related issues, but (not
surprisingly) ignores most of the total-system issues -- which include
insider misuse, clever disenfranchisement, and devastating effects of
pervasive disinformation.  The commercial vendors for the most part don't
care, although Dominion's defense and monster defensive lawsuits (a recent
60 Minutes interviewed the head of Dominion) seem to make a case that they
were brutally trashed by false attacks for which they are seeking BILLIONS
of dollars in damages.

Subject: Why the FBI Is So Far Behind on Cybercrime (NYTimes)

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/06/opinion/ransomware-fbi.html

There are many factors behind the stunning rise of ransomware. Our reporting
found that one of the most important is the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's outmoded approach to computer crime targeting people and
institutions in the United States.

State and local police generally can't handle a sophisticated international
crime that locks victims' data remotely -- from patients' medical histories
and corporate trade secrets to police evidence and students' performance
records -- and demands payment for a key. Many police departments have
themselves been hamstrung by ransomware attacks. Federal investigators,
especially the FBI, are responsible for containing the threat. They need to
do better.

When ransomware gained traction a decade ago, individual attackers were
hitting up home users for a few hundred dollars. In 2015, as the crime was
evolving into something more, the bureau still dismissed ransomware as an
ankle-biter.  That year, about a dozen frustrated Cyber Division agents
warned James Comey, who was then the director of the F.B.I., that
institutional lack of respect for their skills was spurring their
departures. Now well-organized gangs, with hierarchies mirroring those of
traditional businesses, are paralyzing the computer networks of high-profile
targets and demanding millions of dollars in ransom.

Subject: Security Loophole Allows Attackers to Use Wi-Fi to See Through
 Walls (U.Waterloo)a

University of Waterloo (Canada), 13 Nov 2022, via ACM TechNews; 4 Nov 2022

A drone-powered device developed by researchers at Canada's University of
Waterloo can see through walls by accessing Wi-Fi networks. The Wi-Peep
device can fly close to a building and identify all Wi-Fi-enabled devices
inside using the building's Wi-Fi network by taking advantage of the "polite
Wi-Fi" loophole, in which smart devices automatically respond to contact
attempts from any device within range. Comprised of a store-bought drone and
$20 of hardware, Wi-Peep can pinpoint the location of a device within one
meter by measuring response times to the messages it sends to devices while
in flight. Said Waterloo's Ali Abedi, "We need to fix the Polite Wi-Fi
loophole so that our devices do not respond to strangers. We hope our work
will inform the design of next-generation protocols."

  [... and will greatly enhance the accuracy of drone bombers?]

Subject: Scientists Increasingly Can't Explain How AI Works (Vice)

AI researchers are warning developers to focus more on how and why a system
produces certain results than the fact that the system can accurately and
rapidly produce them.

What's your favorite ice cream flavor? You might say vanilla or chocolate,
and if I asked why, you'd probably say it's because it tastes good. But why
does it taste good, and why do you still want to try other flavors
sometimes? Rarely do we ever question the basic decisions we make in our
everyday lives, but if we did, we might realize that we can't pinpoint the
exact reasons for our preferences, emotions, and desires at any given
moment.

There's a similar problem in artificial intelligence: The people who develop
AI are increasingly having problems explaining how it works and determining
why it has the outputs it has. Deep neural networks (DNN) -- made up of
layers and layers of processing systems trained on human-created data to
mimic the neural networks of our brains -- often seem to mirror not just
human intelligence but also human inexplicability.

Most AI systems are black box models, which are systems that are viewed only
in terms of their inputs and outputs. Scientists do not attempt to decipher
the black box, or the opaque processes that the = system undertakes, as long
as they receive the outputs they are looking for. For example, if I gave a
black box AI model data about every single ice cream flavor, and demographic
data about economic, social, and lifestyle factors for millions of people,
it could probably guess what your favorite ice cream flavor is or where your
favorite ice cream store is, even if it wasn't programmed with that
intention.

These types of AI systems notoriously have issues because the data they are
trained on are often inherently biased, mimicking the racial and gender
biases that exist within our society. The haphazard deployment of them leads
to situations where, to use just one example, Black people are
disproportionately misidentified by facial recognition technology. It
becomes difficult to fix these systems in part because their developers
often cannot fully explain how they work, which makes accountability
difficult. As AI systems become more complex and humans become less able to
understand them, AI experts and researchers are warning developers to take a
step back and focus more on how and why a system produces certain results
than the fact that the system can accurately and rapidly produce them. [...]

Joe Tidy, BBC News, 3 Nov 2022, via ACM TechNews, 7 Nov 2022

Research by DappRadar indicates that over the past year, people and
companies have spent $1.93 billion in cryptocurrency to purchase virtual
"real estate" in the metaverse. In Decentraland, parcels of "land" can sell
for millions of dollars, and are being bought by companies like Samsung,
UPS, and Sotheby's to build virtual shops. Adidas, Atari, Ubisoft, Binance,
Warner Music, and Gucci have purchased virtual property in Sandbox, while
Gucci also has created a town in Roblox. Said Amber Jae Slooten of *The
Fabricant*, a digital design house, "There will be for sure a mass market in
this because if you think about the younger generation, they already play
games. For them there's no distinction between virtual and real. But it
still needs to be built."

  [No distinction? Wow!  That is scary, especially when it comes to voting
  and living in the real world (whatever that may be).  PGN]

ACM A.M. Turing Award recipient Tim Berners-Lee, credited with inventing the
World Wide Web, considers Web3 nonviable for building the next iteration of
the Internet. At the Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal, Berners-Lee called Web3
a vague term to describe a theoretical Internet that is more decentralized
than the current Web, incorporating technologies like blockchain,
cryptocurrencies, and nonfungible tokens. Berners-Lee described blockchain
protocols as "too slow, too expensive, and too public." He said people
frequently confuse Web3 with his Web 3.0 framework for reconfiguring the
Internet. His new Inrupt startup intends to allow users to control their own
data via a global single sign-on feature for universal logins, login IDs
that let users exchange data, and a "common universal application
programming interface."

Subject: Adobe Just Held a Bunch of Pantone Colors Hostage (WiReD)

Certain Pantone collections now require users to pay $15 a month to access
them -- with colors turned black unless you pay up.

Since the 1950s, the company Pantone has helped designers match the colors
they see onscreen to what they see in the real world. This color
standardization process means that, for example, a poster made in Adobe
InDesign looks exactly the same when it's printed out as a giant billboard.
And it worked just fineâuntil last week, when everything went dark.

Scores of Photoshop and Illustrator users who have used certain Pantone
color collections in their works have recently been confronted with the
fallout of a disagreement between Adobe and Pantone. The result? Where once
there were vibrant hues there is now only the color black.

The change is the latest twist in a long-running dispute between the design
software giant and the color-standard-setting organization. In December
2021, Adobe announced it would be removing Pantone colors from its app. Why
that happened was never certain; rumors spread that it was over the cost of
including Pantone in Adobe software, while Pantone publicly said that it
felt Adobe wasnât keeping pace with the plethora of new colors it
released. Adobeâs chief product officer, Scott Belsky, has tweeted that
Pantone asked Adobe to remove the colors, âas they want to charge customers
directly.â

lives. City agencies use automation to screen housing applicants, predict
criminal recidivism, identify food assistance fraud, determine if a high
schooler is likely to drop out, inform sentencing decisions for young
people, and many other things.  [...]

The findings are notable beyond DC because they add to the evidence that
many cities have quietly put bureaucratic algorithms to work across their
departments, where they can contribute to decisions that affect citizensâ
lives.  [...]

EPIC says governments can help citizens understand their use of algorithms
by requiring disclosure anytime a system makes an important decision about a
personâs life. And some elected officials have favored the idea of requiring
public registries of automated decisionmaking systems used by governments.
Last month, lawmakers in Pennsylvania, where a screening algorithm had
accused low-income parents of neglect, proposed an algorithm registry law.
[...]

Winters says algorithm registries can work, if rules or laws are in place to
require government departments take them seriously.  ``It's great format,
but it's extremely incomplete.''

Subject: Jeppesen Cyber-Incident Affects Services (AVweb)

Jeppesen says it has addressed some issues caused by a cyber-incident, and
is still working on other services. The disruption also affected
ForeFlight's NOTAM service but that was fixed Sunday.  ForeFlight's NOTAM
services have been fully restored; all new and updated NOTAMs are now being
processed and displayed in ForeFlight Mobile and ForeFlight Web.
