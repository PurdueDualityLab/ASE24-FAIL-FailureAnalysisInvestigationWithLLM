Subject: Crooked software: VW Is Said to Cheat on Diesel Emissions;
  U.S. to Order Big Recall (Coral Davenport)

Coral Davenport, *The New York Times*, 18 Sep 2015
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/19/business/volkswagen-is-ordered-to-recall-nearly-500000-vehicles-over-emissions-software.html

  The Obama administration on Friday directed Volkswagen to recall nearly a
  half-million cars, saying the automaker illegally installed software in
  its diesel-power cars to evade standards for reducing smog.  The
  Environmental Protection Agency accused the German automaker of using
  software to detect when the car is undergoing its periodic state emissions
  testing.  Only during such tests are the cars' full emissions control
  systems turned on. During normal driving situations, the controls are
  turned off, allowing the cars to spew as much as 40 times as much
  pollution as allowed under the Clean Air Act, the E.P.A. said.

  `The Environmental Protection Agency issued the company a notice of
  violation and accused the company of breaking the law by installing
  software known as a `defeat device' in 4-cylinder Volkswagen and Audi
  vehicles from model years 2009-15.  The device is programmed to detect
  when the car is undergoing official emissions testing, and to only turn on
  full emissions control systems during that testing.  Those controls are
  turned off during normal driving situations, when the vehicles pollute far
  more heavily than reported by the manufacturer, the E.P.A. said.

  ``Using a defeat device in cars to evade clean air standards is illegal
  and a threat to public health,'' said Cynthia Giles, the E.P.A.'s
  assistant administrator for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance.
  ``Working closely with the California Air Resources Board, E.P.A. is
  committed to making sure that all automakers play by the same rules.
  E.P.A. will continue to investigate these very serious violations.''

  The software was designed to conceal the cars' emissions of the pollutant
  nitrogen oxide, which contributes to the creation of ozone and smog. The
  pollutants are linked to a range of health problems, including asthma
  attacks and other respiratory diseases.

It will be interesting to see if VW can negotiate the fines for this
massive fraud down to something less than staggering.

  [Henry Baker noted that the affected diesel models include:
   * Jetta (Model Years 2009 ­ 2015)
   * Beetle (Model Years 2009 ­ 2015)
   * Audi A3 (Model Years 2009 ­ 2015)
   * Golf (Model Years 2009 ­ 2015)
   * Passat (Model Years 2014-2015)]

  [We've noted in RISKS previously that this kind of shenanigan could easily
  be used in voting machines (especially proprietary ones), which when run
  in test mode do everything correctly, but when run in live elections might
  surreptitiously do whatever else they might have been programmed to do.

  Like the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, like the Johnstown flood, and
  like that one scene at the beginning of Fight Club, this will be one for
  the engineering ethics text books. If this does turn into a criminal
  investigation - and chances of that are good - we will eventually learn
  how this complete abdication of law and social responsibility came to be.
  Until then, we're left to guess how one of the biggest blunders of
  automotive history came to be, and where Volkswagen and the diesel car
  will be in the years to come.

I have for many years publicly asserted that ethics are a *fundamental*
aspect of engineering -- including software engineering. I have
frequently faced arguments from persons claiming that I'm wrong -- that
engineers should just write the code as they're told to do, and that
their role is not to independently apply any ethical considerations
whatsoever. I cannot even really begin to explain how strongly I
disagree with that view, or how devastating to consumer and user trust
that view can be.   [Lauren Weinstein]

Subject: OPM says 5.6 million fingerprints stolen in cyberattack, five times
  as many as previously thought (Hackaday via LW)

  One of the scariest parts of the massive cybersecurity breaches at the
  Office of Personnel Management just got worse: The agency now says 5.6
  million people's fingerprints were stolen as part of the hacks.  That's
  more than five times the 1.1 million government officials estimated when
  the cyberattacks were initially disclosed over the summer. However, OPM
  said Wednesday the total number of those believed to be caught up in the
  breaches, which included the theft of the Social Security numbers and
  addresses of more than 21 million former and current government employees,
  remains the same.

  [CNBC: ``We recently learned that as far back as 2007, the Inspector
  General was warning that OPM was vulnerable to a breach, but nothing was
  done to prevent it. ... US Gov blames China for breach, ignoring
  implications of their own front door back door mentality.'']

And this is the same government that wants access to our encryption keys.
But don't worry! Simply change your passwords and fingerprints and you'll be

Subject: Sensors You Can Swallow Could Be Made of Nutrients and Powered by
  Stomach Acid (Neil Savage)

Neil Savage, IEEE Spectrum, 21 Sept 2015, via ACM TechNews, 23 Sep 2015

Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) researchers are working on designs for an
ingestible sensor that would combine silicon circuitry and nutrients and
could be powered by stomach acid.  One of the major hurdles when designing
ingestible sensors is convincing regulators they would be safe.  The
approach of Christopher Bettinger's team at CMU is to use organic and
biodegradable materials that are already considered safe to ingest.  They
envision silicon logic circuits encapsulated in a biodegradable hydrogel,
which would enable it to squeeze through tight openings.  The antennas and
electronics would be made of small amounts of digestible minerals such as
manganese, magnesium, and copper.  In addition, the silicon Bettinger's team
proposes using to power the logic circuits of their ingestible sensors can
be converted by the body into silicic acid.  The sensor would be powered by
a battery with a cathode made of melanin and an anode made of manganese
oxide.  When the battery reaches the stomach, acidic gastric juices would
act as an electrolyte and transport current.  During testing, the design has
been able to provide 5 milliwatts of power for up to 20 hours.  The
researchers say ingestible sensors could be used to study the microbiome,
look for infections, and monitor medication uptake.

  Google's informal appeal against a French order to apply the so-called

  domains, not just those in Europe, has been rejected. The president of the

  including the fact that European orders to de-list information from search
  results could be easily circumvented if links were still available on
  Google's other domains.

If Google complies with this order, they'll have set the stage for every
country around the world to demand the right to globally censor literally
anything that their governments find *inconvenient* in Google search
results. Not just EU and other Western countries, but Putin's USSR^h^h^h^h

Subject: Re: Unwanted data transmissions by Windows 10 (Durusau, RISKS-28.93)

One mechanism to prevent some forms of malware involves convincing your
local DNS server that certain names don't exist.

http://www.circleid.com/posts/20100728_taking_back_the_dns/

Modern versions of Bind use rpz (response policy zones) to specify names
that by local policy should be treated specially. The following two lines
could be added to your local rpz zone.

vortex-win.data.microsoft.com   CNAME   .
settings-win.data.microsoft.com CNAME   .

That prevents any machines in your environment from finding the ip addresses
for those names. Of course Microsoft could escalate (like all good virus
writers) and hardcode some starting ip addresses, use fast flux dns servers,
use a random domain name generator to produce domain names to contact for
the telemetry data, etc. But the use of any of those techniques would then
make it even more obvious that Microsoft intends to use your computer,
electricity, and bandwidth for their own purposes, even if that usage
conflicts with your usage.
