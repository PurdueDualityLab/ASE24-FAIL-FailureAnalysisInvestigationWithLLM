Subject: India EVM susceptible to tampering

A group of researchers has demonstrated 2 attacks on the Indian Electronic
Voting Machine (EVM), which has been used to conduct general elections in
the world's largest democracy for over a decade.  The attacks are simple and
cheap to carry out.  A video of the attacks is available at:
  http://indiaevm.org/
The press release is at:
  http://indiaevm.org/press.html
and the full technical paper will be available at:
  http://indiaevm.org/paper.html

Given the black-box testing, "validation" and certification of the EVMs over
the past few years by "noted experts" in India, this raises questions about
the experts' competence and the will of the Government of India to actually
have tamper-proof electronic voting (if such a thing is possible).  This
also raises questions in retrospect of the validity of all elections carried
out in India since the EVM was introduced.

Looking forward with interest (and, I must admit, scantily-concealed glee)
to the Government of India's response.

Subject: Security Analysis of India's Electronic Voting Machines

  [In our long-standing discussions of the risks of election systems,
  electronic or otherwise, this video seems worthy of your attention.  PGN]

J. Alex Halderman, Hari K. Prasad, Rop Gonggrijp, http://indiaevm.org/

Abstract: Elections in India are conducted almost exclusively using
electronic voting machines developed over the past two decades by a pair of
government-owned companies. These devices, known in India as EVMs, have been
praised for their simple design, ease of use, and reliability, but recently
they have also been criticized because of widespread reports of election
irregularities. Despite this criticism, many details of the machines' design
have never been publicly disclosed, and they have not been subjected to a
rigorous, independent security evaluation. In this paper, we present a
security analysis of a real Indian EVM obtained from an anonymous source. We
describe the machine's design and operation in detail, and we evaluate its
security, in light of relevant election procedures. We conclude that in
spite of the machine's simplicity and minimal trusted computing base, it is
vulnerable to serious attacks that can alter election results and violate
the secrecy of the ballot. We demonstrate two attacks, implemented using
custom hardware, which could be carried out by dishonest election insiders
or other criminals with only brief physical access to the machines. This
case study contains important lessons for Indian elections and for
electronic voting security more generally.

Subject: Risks of trusting a sensor, off by 20x

A recorded downturn in Central Market shoppers that had been attributed to
the global financial crisis has now been blamed on a faulty doorway sensor
system.  The Adelaide City Council (ACC) and traders have been in a panic
during the past year over a sharp downturn in visitor figures and fine-tuned
advertising campaigns to attract shoppers.  An ACC report obtained by *The
Advertiser* has found faulty sensors caused the dramatic drop in recorded
visitors, and the ACC has now been forced to review at least a year of data.
One sensor has been blind to 95 per cent of visitors, the report states.
The council's best estimate is that the drop in actual visitor numbers over
the past year is less than 1 per cent, compared with about 10 per cent
previously believed.  [PGN-ed]

Summary:

   Ars moved to new provider.
   Old provider did not lock down/wipe old customer's data soon enough.
   Old provider cracked.  Cracker gets email addresses of Ars subscribers.
   Ars users spammed/phished.

As a sysadmin in the oil patch, this is a very familiar story.  When the
price of oil goes south, they lay off staff and attempt to survive the
downturn.  When price goes back up, they hire me to clean up the mess
(including disabling no longer current logins).

They never budget for the future (secure inactive accounts before they can
hurt us).  They just bet on making it up on the next go-round.

I blame shareholder greed, but that's just me.

http://gizmodo.com/5530178/top-ten-reasons-you-should-quit-facebook
Disclosure by Dan Yoder: I'm the VP of Engineering for a Hollywood-based
social media startup, BorderStylo. The opinions expressed here are purely my
own and are not in any way endorsed by my employer. While I do not see our
applications as directly competitive to Facebook, nor have I presented them
As such, it would be disingenuous not to mention this.  Twitter: @dyoder.

After some reflection, I've decided to delete my account on Facebook.  I'd
like to encourage you to do the same. This is part altruism and part
selfish.  The altruism part is that I think Facebook, as a company, is
unethical.  The selfish part is that I'd like my own social network to
migrate away from Facebook so that I'm not missing anything.  In any event,
here's my "Top Ten" reasons for why you should join me and many others and
delete your account.

10. Facebook's Terms Of Service are completely one-sided.
9. Facebook's CEO has a documented history of unethical behavior.
8. Facebook has flat out declared war on privacy.
7. Facebook is pulling a classic bait-and-switch.
6. Facebook is a bully.
5. Even your private data is shared with applications.
4. Facebook is not technically competent enough to be trusted.
3. Facebook makes it incredibly difficult to truly delete your account.
2. Facebook doesn't (really) support the Open Web.
1. The Facebook application itself sucks.

Dan Goodin, *The Register*, 3 May 2010 [PGN-ed]
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/03/treasury_websites_attack/

Websites operated by the US Treasury Department are redirecting visitors to
websites that attempt to install malware on their PCs, a security researcher
warned on 3 May 2010.  The infection buries an invisible iframe in
bep.treas.gov, moneyfactory.gov, and bep.gov that invokes malicious scripts
from grepad.com.  The code was discovered late the night before and was
active at time of writing, about 12 hours later.

To cover their tracks, the miscreants behind the compromise tailored it so
it attacks only IP addresses that haven't already visited the Treasury
websites. That makes it harder for white hat-hackers and law enforcement
agents to track the exploit. Indeed, Thompson initially reported that the
problem had been fixed until he discovered the sites were merely skipping
over laboratory PCs that had already encountered the attack.  The attack is
most likely related to mass infections that two weeks ago hit hundreds of
sites hosted by Network Solutions and GoDaddy, said Dean De Beer, founder
and CTO of security consultancy Zero(day) Solutions. [...]

If you don't permit Windows 7 updates to install without your individual
approval, be sure to pay attention to KB980408, which is rolling out right
now.  You probably want this one.

Titled "April 2010 stability and reliability update," most of the items
fixed by the update seem relatively innocuous, until you get to this gem at
the end of the list:

  "You are not warned when you delete more than 1000 files at the same
   time. Then, the files are deleted permanently and are not moved to the
   Recycle Bin."

Ouch.  Given how easy it is in Windows Explorer to delete entire folder paths,
this is a non-trivial situation!

Subject: Chip and not bother with the pin

I'm a British immigrant to France so I read the ex-pat forums for
information.  Recently, I read a post on such a forum that made me choke.
Red security flags exploded before my eyes and alarm bells nearly stunned
me:

http://britishexpats.com/forum/showthread.php?t=665410
(it's post number 7 on the thread)

  ``I hired a car last Wednesday afternoon from Paris, and have never had
  any problems with my old style driving license. I did however forget all
  my credit card pin numbers for the deposit. As my card sat in the machine,
  and the woman said regrettably there's nothing they can do if I can't
  remember the pin, the payment went through. She said she'd never seen that
  happen before - because the card had been left for such a long time, it
  took the payment. I think my lucky stars were with me, as I'd arrived
  complete with baby and carseat and was already running late.''

The thing that I want to point out is not so much the bad design that
allowed this to happen, even though it is heart-stopping, but the
*mentality* of the person to whom it happened and the person at the hire car
desk.  The hiree thought he was *lucky* and the hire car woman was
indifferent.  According to the above post, both took a look at something
that shouldn't have happened, something that they would not want to have
happen with a stolen credit card, and said, hey, this is great, it saves me
all sorts of problems.

This is one more reason that security problems are not caught.

Subject: Don't forget to back up the car before reloading the software

It's been many years since my last RISKS contribution, but I just got a
(somewhat agitated) phone call from my wife which prompted me to do so
again.  She's got a Prius which was subject to the recall for faulty
anti-lock brakes.  Apparently the fix was to to load new software.  We're
all used to warnings from software vendors to back up our data before
installing a new version, but the concept seems to have escaped Toyota's
notice.

She had the fix/upgrade done yesterday.  Today she noticed that her phone
contact list (the car has bluetooth pairing with her cell phone and has its
own contact list) is all gone.  I guess they didn't bother to back up the
car before reloading the OS.  Or whatever.

Oversight?  Maybe.  More likely, just standard procedure and to heck with
that fact that they destroyed their customer's data.

account number during a phone call.  Not because I don't trust their
employees (I don't really, but I can't really do anything about that), but
because I could be anywhere -- a doctor's office, a sports venue, on a

Some critical points are omitted here. Yes, you can, but it costs $1.  And
you have to pay for it with a credit card. And the credit card must validate
using either the old or the new address. Clearly the $1 charge is for
security, not for the cost of the service. And as always, an acknowldgement
is snail-mailed to both old and new addresses.

The same procedure appears to apply to change of address by telephone. (They
say it costs $1; I'm assuming that the same credit card requirement
applies.)

While not perfect, consider the old way: you fill out a form, sign it, and
drop it in a letter slot at the post office servicing the old address. Or
you mail it to the postmaster at the old PO. The verification is only a
signature, though the snail-mail acknowledgments are sent.

Neither is perfect, but is the new really worse? Both depend in large part
on heavy penalties for misuse. The credit card validation has holes, but
it's the same technique used by many merchants. Physical signatures are
easily forged.

As for picking up your credit card in Lagos, virtually all mail containing a
credit card has a "non-forwarding endorsement", and USPS policy is that mail
with such an endorsement will not be forwarded, either domestically or
internationally.

I found all the USPS information easily on the USPS web site. A little
research goes a long way.

Subject: RE: Risks of RFID car keys (Garret, RISKS-26.04)

I own a car with an RFID key. It will not lock with the key in the car or in
the trunk.

My wife insisted that the trunk would not lock. She could press the small
rubber button on the trunk handle and the trunk would unlock. I told her
that was because I was close enough with the transmitter in my pocket to
allow the trunk to be opened. To prove that I walked a long distance away
and sure enough the trunk would not open when she pressed the button.

She insisted on testing my theory regularly. Then one day the bomb dropped!
With me and the transmitter quite far away she was able to open the trunk. I
was flabbergasted; what was going on?

The cause was simple. Her purse, with the second transmitter, was in the
trunk. The RFID computer will not let you lock the transmitter (or yourself)
in the trunk. So how do we lock the trunk without removing the transmitter
from her purse? You remove a physical key from the other transmitter and
turn it in the trunk's physical lock.

That takes care of the trunk, but now what about locking the car? It usually
locks by pressing rubber buttons on the driver or passenger door handles or
locks itself after 30 seconds, but that wouldn't work with a transmitter in
the trunk. You have to prove to the RFID computer that there is still a
valid transmitter outside the car by pressing its lock button.

All this was learned because she insists on leaving her transmitter/key in
her purse so it will not get lost.
