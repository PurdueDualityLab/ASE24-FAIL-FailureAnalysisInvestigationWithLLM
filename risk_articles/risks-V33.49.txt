Subject: Nuclear War Simulator Creator Says Public Must Know Potential
 Destruction (Aristos Georgiou)

Aristos Georgiou, *Newsweek*, 19 0ct 2022, via ACM TechNews, 24 Oct 2022

A computer scientist created a nuclear war simulator to demonstrate atomic
weapons' destructive potential to the public. Christopher Minson said
Russia's war in Ukraine has elevated traffic to his website, which hosts a
map tool for modeling an attack on the U.S. involving approximately 1,200
nuclear warheads. Minson based the tool on databases of warhead yields and
targets derived from declassified information; he then compiled a database
of census data, and mapped populations to target sites. Minson said the
system correlates this data and executes a two-hour attack, calculating
casualties from known impact and population size, and modeling the spread of
fallout. "It is critical that the public understands this threat," he said.
"They need to see, clearly and viscerally, just how universal and
destructive a nuclear war would be."

Subject: Climate Change Threatens Supercomputers (Jacklin Kwan)

Jacklin Kwan, *Science*, 11 Oct 2022, via ACM TechNews, 12 Oct 2022

Climate change is jeopardizing the operation of high-performance computing
(HPC) facilities. Natalie Bates at the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) said such facilities, which include
supercomputers and data centers, are vulnerable due to their high cooling
demands and massive energy use. Increased humidity driven by climate change
can reduce the efficiency of the evaporative coolers many HPC centers depend
on, and also can threaten the systems with blowouts. Hewlett Packard
Enterprise's Nicolas Dub=C8 said the high cost of upgrades to adapt to such
changes has driven some HPC centers to cooler and drier locations like
Canada and Finland. LLNL's Anna-Maria Bailey said the cost of relocation may
be unaffordable, so the California facility is considering moving its
computers underground.

"When computers go wrong, we tend to assume it's just some software hiccup,
a bit of bad programming. But ionising radiation, including rays of protons
blasted towards us by the sun, can also be the cause. These incidents,
called single-event upsets, are rare and it can be impossible to be sure
that cosmic rays were involved in a specific malfunction because they leave
no trace behind them."

As silicon features reduce to near atomic dimensions (approaching 1
nanometer == 10), these events are likely increase their frequency. The
biggest supercomputers contain very high-density physical memory pools.
Administrators and reliability engineers battle with row-level memory
failures constantly.

Subject: NYC's Emerg. Med. Svc ("911") system was crippled  'cuz ...

In NYC, the "911" calls come into a central "public safety answering
position" ("psap").  If the emergency required EMS or fire response, it's
transferred to the fire dep't center and then dispatched from there.

The FDNY dispatch and control system was crippled for half a day earlier
this week because...

  ... a contractor, thinking he was pushing an "open the door, Hal", button,
  lifted the cover on a button labeled "EPO"...

Which stood for... "emergency power off".

Ok, everyone, start cringing...  Including asking why, in addition to not
having a secondary "hot standby" system, it took *hours* to bring this back
up.

  [NY Post]

  Oops! FDNY contractor presses wrong button, shuts down NYC's emergency
  dispatch system

  An outside contractor making repairs at the FDNY's emergency dispatch
  center in downtown Brooklyn pressed the wrong button to open a door -- and
  shut down the agency's communications system, triggering an hours-long
  citywide crisis.

  Wednesday's snafu at the FDNY's MetroTech Center facility forced staffers
  to rely on ancient methods - pens, paper and telephones rather than
  digital systems -- to gather facts and get word to first responders as 911
  calls came in, officials for unions representing the agency's dispatchers
  and medics told The Post.

  Delays responding to emergency calls ranged from a few minutes to more
  than an hour, said Oren Barzilay, president of Local 2507, which
  represents city EMTs and paramedics.  [...]

  The shutdown occurred around 11 a.m. when a repairman from communications
  company Lightpath responded to a report of an earlier glitch at the data
  center.  [...]

The repairman mistook a glass-enclosed button, marked "EPO" for "emergency
power off," for an electronic door release button, so he opened the lid and
accidentally shut down the system, workers recalled. [...[

The agency's radio systems were down until 2:30 p.m., and mobile data
terminals out in the field weren't fully operational until 6 p.m., Smyth
and Barzilay said.

Subject: AI Language Models Show Bias Against People with Disabilities,
 Study Finds (Penn State)

Jessica Hallman, Penn State News, 13 Oct 2022, via ACM TechNews, 19 Oct 2022

Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) researchers found that natural
language processing models often are biased against people with
disabilities. The researchers studied 13 popular machine learning models
trained to generate sequences of words, and tested over 15,000 unique
sentences on each model to produce word associations for over 600 adjectives
that could be associated with individuals with or without disabilities. The
researchers assessed the sentiment of each adjective generated as positive,
negative, or neutral, finding that sentences with disability-related words
scored more negatively than sentences lacking them. Penn State's Pranav
Venkit said the work demonstrates "that people need to care about what sort
of models they are using and what the repercussions are that could affect
real people in their everyday lives."

"The journey between identifying a potential therapeutic compound and Food

Association for Computing Machinery, 13 Oct 2022,
via ACM TechNews, October 14, 2022

Despite their efficiency in confirming the accuracy of election results,
risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are underused, according to a new TechBrief from
ACM's global Technology Policy Council. The authors found only five
U.S. states will require then in the upcoming November elections, while just
10 additional states either have RLA pilot programs or allow their
use. Meanwhile, Denmark is the only other country to have performed an RLA
of an election. "RLAs give us the best of both worlds: a high degree of
accuracy and transparency without the enormous undertaking that is counting
every contest on every ballot by hand," said TechBrief co-lead author
Matthew Bernhard.

Episode lasting almost 2 days prompted the closure of a runway at Dallas

The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the cause of mysterious

flight personnel and air traffic controllers of GPS interference over a
40-mile swath of airspace near the Dallas-Fort Worth airport.  The advisory

There appears to be a significant flaw in the Google Chat notification model
that can easily cause desktop users to be unaware of important chat replies

These notification issues may relate to the hangouts->chat migration.  On

Subject: Police Are Using DNA to Generate 3D Images of Suspects They've
 Never Seen (Vice)

Releasing one of these Parabon images to the public like the Edmonton Police
did recently, is dangerous and irresponsible, especially when that image
implicates a Black person and an immigrant.

On Tuesday, the Edmonton Police Service (EPS) shared a computer generated
image of a suspect
<https://www.edmontonpolice.ca/News/MediaReleases/DNAPhenotypeOct4> they
created with DNA phenotyping, which it used for the first time in hopes of
identifying a suspect from a 2019 sexual assault case. Using DNA evidence
from the case, a company called Parabon NanoLabs created the image of a
young Black man. The composite image did not factor in the suspect's age,
BMI, or environmental factors, such as facial hair, tattoos, and scars. The
EPS then released this image to the public, both on its website and on
social media platforms including its Twitter, claiming it to be ``a last
resort after all investigative avenues have been exhausted.''  The EPS's
decision to produce and share this image is extremely harmful, according to
privacy experts, raising questions about the racial biases in DNA
phenotyping for forensic investigations and the privacy violations of DNA
databases that investigators are able to search through.

In response to the EPS's tweet of the image, many privacy and criminal
justice experts replied with indignation at the irresponsibility of the
police department. Callie Schroeder, the Global Privacy Counsel at the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, retweeted the tweet, questioning the
usefulness of the image: ``Even if it is a new piece of information, what
are you going to do with this? Question every approximately 5'4" black man
you see? ...that is not a suggestion, absolutely do not do that.''  [...]

  facilities and his obsession with inventing an everlasting fibre. Whilst
  working as a labourer at the Birnley Mills, he accidentally becomes an
  unpaid researcher and invents an incredibly strong fibre which repels dirt
  and never wears out. From this fabric, a suit is made-which is brilliant
  white because it cannot absorb dye and slightly luminous because it
  includes radioactive elements.

  Stratton is lauded as a genius until both management and the trade unions
  realise the consequence of his invention; once consumers have purchased
  enough cloth, demand will drop precipitously and put the textile industry
  out of business. The managers try to trick and bribe Stratton into signing
  away the rights to his invention but he refuses. Managers and workers each

 find (Yahoo! News)

Heat-detecting cameras can help crack passwords up to a minute after typing
them, researchers have found, as they warn similar systems could be
developed by criminals to break into computers and smartphones.

Heat from people's fingertips can be detected on recently-used keyboards
and, when thermal images were combined with the help of artificial
intelligence, informed guesses of what the password could be were made by a
tool developed by researchers at the University of Glasgow.

Some 86% of passwords were cracked when thermal images were taken within 20
seconds of typing in the secret code and put through their ThermoSecure
system, and 76% when within 30 seconds. Success dropped to 62% after 60
seconds of entry.

They also found within 20 seconds, the system was capable of successfully
attacking even long passwords of 16 characters, with a rate of up to 67%
correct attempts.

It's important that computer security research keeps pace with these
developments to find new ways to mitigate risk, and we will continue to
develop our technology to try to stay one step ahead of attackers.  [...]

A: They're all really in Cambridge ON (Ontario), Canada.  (In some cases,
the street names are a bit off.  Usually, "street" instead of "road", but
"Bellis" is actually "Ellis".)

I don't know what's gotten into Zillow, but they seem to have a problem!

Previously unreported details shed new light on Twitter's motivations for
selling the company -- and Elon Musk's plans to transform it.

Twitter's workforce is likely to be hit with massive cuts in the coming
months, no matter who owns the company, interviews and documents obtained by
*The Washington Post* show, a change likely to have major impact on its
ability to control harmful content and prevent data security crises.

Elon Musk told prospective investors in his deal to buy the company that he
planned to get rid of nearly 75 percent of Twitter's 7,500 workers,
whittling the company down to a skeleton staff of just over 2,000.

 with Malware (Bill Toulas)

Bill Toulas, *BleepingComputer*, 23 Oct 2022,
via ACM TechNews, 24 Oct 2022

Researchers at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science in the
Netherlands discovered thousands of GitHub repositories offering fake
proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for various vulnerabilities, including
malware. The researchers analyzed slightly more than 47,300 repositories
promoting exploits for vulnerabilities disclosed between 2017 and 2021 using
Internet Protocol (IP) address analysis, binary analysis, and hexadecimal
and Base64 analysis. Over 2,800 of 150,734 unique IPs extracted matched
blocklist entries, 1,522 were labeled malicious in antivirus scans on Virus
Total, and 1,069 of them were in the AbuseIPDB database. The researchers
designated 4,893 of 47,313 tested repositories malicious, with most focusing
on vulnerabilities from 2020. The researchers advised software testers to
thoroughly vet the PoCs they download, and to run as many checks as possible
before execution.

Subject: Google's "passkey" effort

https://twitter.com/laurenweinstein/status/1581325271810027523

I have long advocated for FIDO U2F security keys as the preferred multiple
factor authentication model, and have suggested explicitly that "passwords
must die". So it's natural that I'm being asked about the @google "passkey"
initiative.

There are multiple aspects to this. An obvious one is how rapidly sites will
implement this method. Given the glacial speed with which many financial
institutions have implemented crude 2-factor like text messaging and have
delayed U2F key implementations, I am not optimistic.

Of even more concern is the sense that the methodology of passkeys will
appeal mainly to the tech-savvy, and will be understandably resisted by many
everyday users, who will find the model overly complex and difficult to
trust for that reason.

This presents a familiar dilemma: persons who already are careful with their
authentication security will benefit but the users most in need of improved
security and who are most vulnerable largely will not -- especially if they
don't use multiple devices and 24/7 smartphones.

The upshot isn't that passkeys won't have a place -- they will -- but that I
suspect they will not be accepted by a significant proportion of sites and
users, keeping in mind that many people even refuse to use ordinary
autofill, especially for passwords or payment methods.

I have pointed out this problem with @google outreach to users many times
over the years, and again, while there have been some improvements, many
users are still being left behind, and that's very unfortunate indeed.

"What we now call the reinforcement learning problem was first considered in
1933 by the pathologist William Thompson. He wondered: if I have two
untested treatments and a population of patients, how should I assign
treatments in succession to cure the most patients?

"More generally, the reinforcement learning problem is about how to plan
your actions to best accrue rewards over the long term. The hitch is that,
to begin with, you're not sure how your actions affect rewards, but over
time you can observe the dependence. For Thompson, an action was the
selection of a treatment, and a reward corresponded to a patient being
cured."

Without human oversight, a generalized superintelligence might be a "no

Subject: Humans Beat DeepMind AI in Creating Algorithm to Multiply Numbers
 (Matthew Sparkes)

Matthew Sparkes, *New Scientist*, 13 Oct 2022, via ACM TechNews, 17 Oct 2022

Jakob Moosbauer and Manuel Kauers at Austria's Johannes Kepler University
Linz bested an algorithm developed by artificial intelligence company
DeepMind with a program that can perform matrix multiplication more
efficiently. Earlier this month, DeepMind unveiled a method for multiplying
two five-by-five matrices in just 96 multiplications, out-performing a
more-than-50-year-old record. Moosbauer and Kauers reduced the process to 95
multiplications by testing multiple steps in multiplication algorithms to
see if they could be combined. Said Moosbauer, "We take an existing
algorithm and apply a sequence of transformations that at some point can
lead to an improvement. Our technique works for any known algorithm, and if
we are lucky, then [the results] need one multiplication less than before."

This suggests to me that a good strategy to confound the thermal detectors
would be to use repeated characters in passwords. I doubt that the thermal
detection would be able to tell how many times a key was pressed, rather
than just the recency of a given key press. That would go against the common
assumption that repeated characters in passwords are a Bad Thing.

the places they inspect airmail are not the ones where they inspect sea

repackage and redirect the institutional kind for home use.

Naturally, I would like more research into why so many cars are crashing
into the chicane (a large, clearly marked, immobile structure): but this is
not necessarily a bad thing. Crashing into a chicane is better than mowing
down a child. The chicane is, presumably, better signposted and more visible
than any small child, so any driver who crashed into the chicane is
presumably a risk to children, not just in the road but also on the
pavement: since the chicane hitter obviously has difficulty in keeping to
the road! Perhaps it is just as well that they are taken out of action
before they can do more serious harm?

I have written an article explaining the thinking behind CHERI and how
Microsoft engineers using CHERI believe that they can eliminate as much two
thirds of vulnerabilities in software that uses C or C++:

CHERI provides hardware support for limiting the range of pointers as well
as support for mechanisms to prevent use-after-free bugs. CHERI provides
scalable compartmentalization, meaning that operating systems themselves can
be partitioned on memory boundaries without the performance expense of
changing context or flushing page caches. Overall, CHERI is a project that
may prove to be the most significant change in architecture in decades.

More infos and sample chapter:
https://fuchsc.uti.at/books/digital-ethics/

This fifth volume in Christian Fuchs, Media, Communication and Society
series, presents an approach to critical digital ethics. It develops
foundations and applications of digital ethics based on critical theory. It
applies a critical approach to ethics within the realm of digital
technology.

Based on the notions of alienation, communication (in)justice, media
(in)justice, and digital (in)justice, it analyses ethics in the context of
digital labour and the surveillance-industrial complex; social media
research ethics; privacy on Facebook; participation, co-operation, and
sustainability in the information society; the digital commons; the digital
public sphere; and digital democracy. The book consists of three arts. Part
I presents some of the philosophical foundations of critical, humanist
digital ethics. Part II applies these foundations to concrete digital ethics
case studies. Part III presents broad conclusions about how to advance the
digital commons, the digital public sphere, and digital democracy, which is
the ultimate goal of critical digital ethics.  [...]
