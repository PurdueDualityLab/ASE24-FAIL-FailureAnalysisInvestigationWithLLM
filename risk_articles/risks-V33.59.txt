Vint Cerf Helped Create the Internet on the Back of an Envelope. Now
He's Calling for More Critical Thinking About How We Use It

Emily Bobrow, *The Wall Street Journal*, 16 Dec 2022
via ACM TechNews, 19 Dec 2022

Google Chief Internet Evangelist and 2004 ACM A.M. Turing Award co-recipient
Vint Cerf helped invent the Internet but acknowledges its downsides,
including its use for spreading misinformation and disinformation. Cerf says
addressing this "propagation problem" requires Google and similar companies
to better "understand how these mechanisms influence the way people behave."
He observes that although commercialization has broadened the Internet's
scope, feedback algorithms appear to be directing people toward "more
divisive and extreme stuff." Cerf urges more critical thinking to rein in
the Internet's sociological and psychological effects, while businesses must
make better efforts to contain online trolling, lying, bullying, and
surveillance.

Subject: Russians Hacked JFK Airport Taxi Dispatch in Line-Skipping  Scheme
 (WiReD)

According to prosecutors, two Queens men, Daniel Abayev and Peter Leyman,
worked with Russian hackers to gain access to the taxi dispatch system for
New York'sJFK airport. They then allegedly created a group chat where
drivers could secretly pay $10 to skip the sometimes hours-long line to be
assigned a pickup√¢about a fifth of the $52 flat fee passengers pay for rides
from the airport to elsewhere in NYC. The indictment against the two men
doesn't name the Russians or detail exactly how they gained access to JFK's
dispatch system. But it notes that since 2019, Abayev and Leyman allegedly
schemed to get access to the system by multiple methods, including bribing
someone to insert a USB drive with malware into one of the dispatch
operators' computers, gaining unauthorized access to their systems via
Wi-Fi, and stealing one of their tablet computers.  ``I know that the
Pentagon is being hacked,'' Abayev wrote to his Russian contacts in November
2019, according to the indictment, ``So, can't we hack the taxi
industry[?]''

Before the scheme was shut down, prosecutors say it was enabling as many as
a thousand fraudulent line-skips a day for drivers,

The shoebox-shaped device, designed to capture fingerprints and perform iris
scans, was listed on eBay for $149.95. A German security researcher,
Matthias Marx, successfully offered $68, and when it arrived at his home in
Hamburg in August, the rugged, hand-held machine contained more than what
was promised in the listing.

The device's memory card held the names, nationalities, photographs,

Subject: Lawmakers Signal Inquiries Into U.S. Government's Use of Foreign
 Spyware (NYTimes)

Senior lawmakers said they would investigate the government's purchase and
use of powerful spyware made by two Israeli hacking firms, as Congress
passed a measure in recent days to try to rein in the proliferation of the
hacking tools.

Representative Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who is chairman of the
House Intelligence Committee, sent a letter last week to the head of the
Drug Enforcement Administration asking for detailed information about the
agency's use of Graphite, a spyware tool produced by the Israeli company
Paragon.

``Such use could have potential implications for U.S. national security, as
well as run contrary to efforts to deter the broad proliferation of powerful
surveillance capabilities to autocratic regimes and others who may misuse
them,'' Mr. Schiff wrote in the letter.

Graphite, like the better-known Israeli hacking tool Pegasus, can penetrate
the mobile phones of its targets and extract messages, videos, photos and
other content. The New York Times revealed this month that the DEA was using
Graphite in its foreign operations. The agency has said it uses the tool
legally and only outside the United States, but has not answered questions
about whether American citizens can be targeted with the hacking tool.

Subject: Southwest COO explained that the company's outdated scheduling
 software quickly became the main culprit of the cancellations once the
 storm cleared.

The extreme cold, ice and snow grounded planes and left some crew members
stranded, so Southwest's crew schedulers worked furiously to put a new
schedule together, matching available crew with aircraft that were ready to
fly. But the Federal Aviation Administration strictly regulates when flight
crews can work, complicating Southwest's scheduling efforts.

``The process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft could not
be handled by our technology,'' Watterson said.  ``The process of matching
up those crew members with the aircraft could not be handled by our
technology.''

Southwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available
crew, but the company's scheduling software wasn't able to match them
quickly and accurately, Watterson added.  ``As a result, we had to ask our
crew schedulers to do this manually, and it's extraordinarily difficult.
That is a tedious, long process.''  Watterson noted that manual scheduling
left Southwest building an incredibly delicate house of cards that could
quickly tumble when the company encountered a problem.  ``They would make
great progress, and then some other disruption would happen, and it would
unravel their work.  So, we spent multiple days where we kind of got close
to finishing the problem, and then it had to be reset.''

  At all relevant times, taxi drivers who sought to pick up a fare at JFK
  were required to wait in a holding lot at JFK before being dispatched to a
  specific terminal by the Dispatch System.  Taxi drivers were frequently
  required to wait several hours in the lot before being dispatched to a
  terminal and were dispatched in approximately the order in which they
  arrived at the holding lot.

  Beginning in 2019, ABAYEV and LEYMAN explored and attempted various
  mechanisms to access the Dispatch System, including bribing someone to
  insert a flash drive containing malware into computers connected to the
  Dispatch System, obtaining unauthorized access to the Dispatch System via
  a Wi-Fi connection, and stealing computer tablets connected to the
  Dispatch System.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/12/21/maryland-529-college-tuition-savings/

Maryland, like most US states, offers a college savings plan.  The
calculations of account values seem to have been incorrect, and the state is
having a hard time figuring out the correct values.  In the meantime,
accounts are frozen, as is the ability to make withdrawals to pay for
college.

The only thing surprising about this to me is that it doesn't happen more
often -- the calculations for value must be pretty complex, and once a small
bug gets in, figuring out the right numbers can't be easy.

Subject: Scammers Are Scamming Other Scammers Out of Millions of Dollars
 (WiReD)

On cybercrime forums, user complaints about being duped may accidentally
expose their real identities.

Pretty funny: Nobody is immune to beingscammed online -- not even the people
running the scams. Cybercriminals using hacking forums to buy software
exploits and stolen login details keep falling for cons and are getting
ripped off thousands of dollars at a time, a new analysis has revealed. And
what's more, when the criminals complain that they are being scammed,
they're also leaving a trail of breadcrumbs of their own personal
information that could reveal their real-world identities to police and
investigators.

Hackers and cybercriminals often gather on specific forums and marketplaces
to do business with each other. They can advertise upcoming work they need
help with, sell databases of people's stolen passwords and credit card
information, or tout new security vulnerabilities that can be used to break
into people's devices or systems. However, these deals often donn't go to
plan.

The new research, published today by cybersecurity firm Sophos, examines
these failed transactions and the complaints people have made about them.
``Scammers scamming scammers on criminal forums and marketplaces is much
bigger than we originally thought it was,'' says Matt Wixey, researcher with
Sophos X-Ops who studied the marketplaces.

Li-ion batteries are "pretty unique fire hazards," said a spokesperson for

An increase in battery fires linked to electric bicycles has caught the
attention of municipal and federal officials, who point to public education
rather than bans as the best way to keep people safe.

As of late December, there were 206 e-bike fires in New York City in 2022,
more than double the number of fires that occurred the year prior, according
to a New York Fire Department spokesperson. Those e-bike fires are blamed
for 142 injuries in 2022, almost 80% more than in 2021, and six deaths. In
2020, there were just 44 e-bike fires, which were associated with 23
injuries and no deaths, the department said.

Subject: Studies flag environmental impact of reentry (SpaceNews)

*Megaconstellations promise a steady flow of de-orbiting debris. Can the sky
take it?*

Space hardware tumbling out of orbit may lead to unforeseen environmental
and climate impacts. Due to the growing scale and pace of launch activities,
what is needed is better monitoring of the situation, as well as regulation
to create an environmentally sustainable space industry.

Making that case is Jamie Shutler, associate professor of Earth observation
at the University of Exeter, Cornwall.

Shutler and colleagues authored the research paper Atmospheric Impacts of
the Space Industry Require Oversight in the August issue of the journal
*Nature Geoscience.*

Decreased satellite costs have led to large spacecraft constellations,
thereby creating a constant flow of de-orbiting debris as craft die and are
replaced.  ``This debris could double the annual injection of aerosol
particle mass into the mesosphere,'' the paper explains, thereby increasing
the number of aluminum particles that can reach the stratosphere, where they
promote ozone loss.

Shutler told *SpaceNews, ``We are now realizing the full benefits of access
to space, but our understanding of the environmental impact of these
activities is currently limited.  Maximizing these benefits whilst
minimizing the environmental impact is likely to become increasingly
important for science and industry.''  [...]

assets. So they're selling what can be sold -- such as subsidiaries that are
solvent going concerns.

 Celsius bought Israeli crypto custody company GK8 in October 2021 for $115
million -- $100 million in cash, and the rest in their own CEL tokens.  Now
Celsius wants to sell GK8 to Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital for $44
million, plus $100,000 assumed liabilities (debts that Galaxy will be
responsible for). This is a huge loss -- but Galaxy was the only qualified
bidder.  [...]

It's important to keep in mind that this week's hearings have been furious
arguments over the alignment of the deck chairs on the Titanic.  But the
iceberg is still there. Celsius is flat broke. There's no business. There
are pennies left for creditors at best. Celsius is a shambling zombie. It
should have been liquidated in July.

  I sure can't completely follow these narratives but the writing is
  brilliant and details are grimly laughable.

 Empire -- and Dated.  Other Employees Have Lots of Questions (Coindesk)

CoinDesk spoke to several current and former FTX and Alameda employees who
agreed to talk on the condition of anonymity, citing ongoing harassment and
death threats due to the exchange√¢s solvency issues. And they said
essentially this: It's a place full of conflicts of interest, nepotism and
lack of oversight.

``The whole operation was run by a gang of kids in the Bahamas,'' a person
familiar with the matter told CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity.

FTX and Alameda employees CoinDesk interviewed say they have been kept in
the dark about the events of the past week, adding that only CEO
Bankman-Fried's inner circle may have had knowledge that the exchange, as
reported by the Wall Street Journal, siphoned customer funds into corporate
sibling Alameda.

Subject: Sympathy for the crypto bros (Mother Jones)

Things are falling apart for Sam Bankman-Fried, the FTX founder who
allegedly defrauded investors before filing bankruptcy and spelling
financial ruin for crypto investors, including, as my colleague Ali Breland
has reported, those who weren't very rich to start out with.

Yesterday, SBF, as he's known, was arrested in the Bahamas. Today, federal
prosecutors filed eight charges against him, including wire fraud, money
laundering, and making illegal campaign donations. This is all very bad, but
I have mainly been interested in SBF's apparent relationships with
co-workers and business associates, which, as Intelligencer pointed out, are
more than just salacious details and actually pretty important to
understanding the company's power dynamics.

While it's easy to dismiss the plight of people who invested in
cryptocurrency, you can't really blame people for investing in
get-rich-quick schemes when wealth inequality is widening and home ownership
is a pipe dream for many members of the younger generations.  "The moral
question upon seeing the gap between owners and buyers, between the poor and
ultra-rich, between capitalist owners and workers, is how do we end it?" Ali
wrote last year. "Yet in an economy where most people work long hours, are
struggling to get by, and have deeply internalized the status quo, that
question becomes: How do I get in?"

  Not all victims were downtrodden proles. How about the well-off who should
  have known better? Or did, just figuring there's be bigger fools to buy
  them out nicely. Then the music stopped.

Subject: Code-Generating AI Can Introduce Security Vulnerabilities
 (Kyle Wiggers)

Kyle Wiggers, TechCrunch, 28 Dec 2022, via ACM TechNews, 30 Dec 2022

Software engineers who use code-generating artificial intelligence (AI)
systems are more likely to cause security vulnerabilities in the apps they
develop, according to researchers affiliated with Stanford University. Their
study looked at Codex, an AI code-generating system developed by research
lab OpenAI. The researchers recruited developers to use Codex to complete
security-related problems across programming languages, including Python,
JavaScript, and C. Participants who had access to Codex were more likely to
write incorrect and *insecure* solutions to programming problems compared to
a control group, and they were more likely to say that their insecure
answers were secure compared to the people in the control.

Subject: Re: Dreams of a Future in Big Tech Dim for Computer Science
 Students (RISKS-33.57)

ABET certification requires coverage of ethics.  The ACM/IEEE curricular
recommendations include ethics.  So, common curricula generally include the
topic.

Of course, that doesn't mean that it is covered in any meaningful way.  I
know some institutions give it only a passing mention. At others, it is
likely a topic at the end of some courses that is viewed as expendable when
there is more to cover from the syllabus than there is class time in the
semester.  Thankfully, this is not the case everywhere.

I haven't found meaningful coverage in many textbooks, which means it is
easy to overlook.  For faculty who are uncomfortable with the topic, or who
have no experience in presenting it, this often means the topic is given
superficial (if any) coverage in classes.

In a sense, professional ethics is a CS topic similar to writing safe code:
It is in the syllabi at most schools but given only a vague hand wave at too
many schools because the potential employers of students are more interested
in a few more weeks of instruction in some fad topic. In the view of
faculty, students are more likely to get employed if they know how to build
a blockchain or ML system rather than spend time learning how to employ them
in an ethical manner, and recent news continues to illustrate the problems
with that approach.

To relate a particular positive example: I include a section on professional
ethics in every course I have taught at Purdue since I got here 35 years
ago.  I have created both an undergrad and a grad course that include
multi-week discussions of ethics (and bias, logical fallacies, and
misinformation, among other topics) that seem to be well-received by
students, although both are electives.  A decade ago, the department adopted
an ethics requirement for grad students.  This involves an introductory
lecture that I give and a requirement to complete the CITI course on
responsible conduct of research.

I'm told by people at companies and government agencies (and by alumni) that
they wish other schools devoted time and resources to the topic the way we
do.  Meanwhile, I know we could do more at the undergrad level.

(I'm writing this as someone who has participated in the development of the
last 2 iterations of the ACM Code of Professional Ethics, as an attendee of
Terry Bynum's '81 conference[*], and as leader of ACM's committee on
publication ethics.  So I cannot make any claim to being a *typical* faculty
member in this regard or that the Purdue experience is more generalizable.)

The science-fiction stories of rogue AI, concerns about autonomous weapons
systems, issues of cryptocurrency fraud, and the other topics we have seen
for decades in RISKS (thanks, Peter) are not solely traceable to technical
faults -- or even primarily traceable to the technology.  They are based on
choices and decisions by people who, too often, are thinking about whether
they can do something rather than whether it is proper to do those things,
and evaluating the consequences.

We can definitely do better.

Those answers appear inconsistent with one another. Google demonstrates that
adagio is faster than either lento or largo, but GPT-3's response seems to
claim that adagio is slower than lento.  Maybe GPT-3 is going by the
principle that "slow" is slower than "slower," but that's not how one reads
it when the statements are adjacent to one another.
