Subject: Election systems already hacked? (Bob Woodward)

I'm reading the new Bob Woodward book, *Rage, *and came across this
unsettling quote:

  "The NSA and CIA had evidence, highly classified, that the Russians had
  placed malware in the election registration system in at least two
  counties in Florida -- St. Lucie County and Washington County. There was
  no evidence yet that the malware had been activated. It was sitting there
  to be used.  The voting system vendor used by Florida was used by state
  election registration systems all around the country. The Russian malware
  was sophisticated and could be activated in counties with particular
  demographics. For instance, in areas with higher percentages of Black
  residents, the malware could erase every tenth voter, almost certainly
  reducing the total vote count for Democrats. The same could potentially be
  activated to reduce Trump votes in Republican districts.".

I've read lots of warnings about *attempts* to hack into American voting
systems, but hadn't been aware of any successful penetrations.

This seems very serious to me.  If it is determined, after the fact, that
votes were miscounted or voters were not allowed to vote in a battleground
state, what will we do?

*Rage* has been getting lots of publicity, but so far as I know no one has
picked up on this passage, which even the author doesn't make a big noise
about.

Hopefully the counties that have been hacked (and all others using that
brand of voting software) have had their systems scrubbed clean--it doesn't
say one way or the other in the book.

Subject: Unsecured Microsoft Bing Server Exposed Users' Search Queries and
  Location (The Hacker News)

A back-end server associated with Microsoft Bing exposed sensitive data of
the search engine's mobile application users, including search queries,
device details, and GPS coordinates, among others.

The logging database, however, doesn't include any personal details such as
names or addresses.

The data leak, discovered by Ata Hakcil of WizCase
<https://www.wizcase.com/blog/bing-leak-research/> on September 12, is a
massive 6.5TB cache of log files that was left for anyone to access without
any password, potentially allowing cybercriminals to leverage the
information for carrying out extortion and phishing scams.

According to WizCase, the Elastic server is believed to have been password
protected until September 10, after which the authentication seems to have
been inadvertently removed.

After the findings were privately disclosed to Microsoft Security Response
Center, the Windows maker addressed the misconfiguration on September 16.

Misconfigured servers have been a constant source of data leaks
<https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/prison-phone-service-exposes-millions-inmate-records/>
in recent years, resulting in exposure of email addresses, passwords, phone
numbers, and private messages.  [...]

Subject: The Fight Over the Fight Over California's Privacy Future (WiReD)

Proposition 24 is designed to make the California Consumer Privacy Act
stronger.  Why do so many privacy advocates oppose it?

When state senator Bob Hertzberg learned that an ambitious privacy
initiative had gotten enough signatures to qualify for the ballot in
California, he knew he had to act quickly.

``My objective was to get the damn thing off the ballot.''

Subject: Fake directors plan to combat money laundering (bbc.com)

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54209977

The UK's Companies House comprises a core system of record that
authenticates business ownership and persons of significant control (PSC) --
corporate directors. Historically weak oversight enabled rampant criminal
exploitation via money laundering enterprises.

"One estimate from Transparency International (TI), which investigates
corruption, identified almost 1,000 front companies responsible for up to
£137 billion of suspected criminal money flowing through the UK."

See https://www.transparency.org/en/blog/gatekeepers-asleep-on-the-job for
instance:

"Reporting of major corruption scandals usually puts the high-profile
kleptocrats front and centre, and rightly so. But, more often than not, the
criminal and corrupt couldn't launder their ill-gotten gains without a
variety of professional services, including those of accountants, notaries,
real estate agents and bankers.

"These professions are subject to specific anti-money laundering
obligations, and are meant to be the first line of defence protecting the
global financial system against dirty money."

Professionals routinely shirk ethical responsibilities.

Tightening oversight is key to suppress illegitimate commercial
activities. This document details significant reform measures:
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/919356/corporate-transparency-register-reform-consultation-government-response.pdf.

Lord Callanan, the UK Minister for Climate Change and Corporate
Responsibility states in the forward, "Too often I see companies repeatedly
set up and closed down to avoid paying debts -- so called 'phoenixing'.
Shell companies have been set up for no other purpose than to launder the
proceeds of crime -- committed both here and overseas."

The identified reforms close numerous loopholes that enabled money
laundering enterprises to acquire legitimacy. The reforms rely heavily on
digital document and identity authentication mechanisms. Agents performing
registrations on behalf of candidates PSC are required to demonstrate
comprehensive credential verification due diligence.

Third-party ID verification services will be enlisted to accelerate and vet
the credentials of PSC candidates before they acquire Companies House bona
fides. Cross-referencing government systems of record will establish
candidate authenticity.

The new processes are scheduled to roll-out for user testing at the end of
financial year 2020/2021. Wait and see what transparency.org reports about
UK money laundering in the near future.

My guess is that another nation will see an incremental growth in
money-laundering traffic as the UK strengthens controls.

Subject: D.C.'s New Area Code Will Be... 771 (DCist)

For more than seven decades, (202) has been D.C.'s sole area code. But by
the end of 2022, the city will have a new one: (771).

This month regulators started the 13-month process to implement the new
(771) area code, a step that reflects the reality that the longstanding
(202) area code -- first unveiled in 1947 as one of the country's 86
original area codes -- is running out of of available phone numbers.

Each area code can produce roughly eight million seven-digit phone numbers,
and the North American Numbering Plan Administrator -- the official
regulator of area codes in the U.S., Canada and some Caribbean countries --
says (202) is expected to run out of numbers within two years. In fact, the
number of (202) phone numbers remaining declined at such a rapid pace this
year that in August NANPA formally declared it was in jeopardy, kicking off
a series of steps to slow its march towards extinction -- including
rationing numbers.

https://dcist.com/story/20/09/22/washington-dc-new-area-code-771-district-phone/

...another non-renewable resource. I wonder how many area codes NANPA has
unallocated -- and when we'll need four-digit area codes. Or hexadecimal
phone keypads, or phone numbers including */#. (Yes, latter two are jokes --
mostly)

So-called single sign-on options offer a lot of convenience. But they have
downsides that a good old fashioned password manager doesn't.

No surprise here; I keep reminding people of this.

Subject: New Covid-19 swab test robot offers safe, more comfortable
  procedure for patients (Straits Times)

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/robot-that-conducts-swab-tests-for-covid-19-is-safe-faster-and-more-comfortable-for

SARS-CoV2 exposure constitutes an occupational risk for healthcare
professionals. Singapore commenced deployment of a prototype SwabBot to
reduce this risk. Other countries have also deployed similar solutions.

"'Our team felt that we had to find a better way to swab patients to reduce
the risk of exposure of Covid-19 to our healthcare workers, especially when
patients sneeze or cough during the swabbing process,' said principal
investigator Rena Dharmawan, associate consultant of head and neck surgery
at NCCS' Division of Surgery and Surgical Oncology."

 From the US Center for Disease Control,
https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html#health-care-personnel
(retrieved on 22SEP2020) reveals infections and deaths among healthcare
professionals participating in the COVID-19 pandemic response.

"Data were collected from 5,043,006 people, but healthcare personnel status
was only available for 1,213,744 (24.07%) people. For the 160,860 cases of
COVID-19 acquired by healthcare personnel, death status was only available
for 115,817 (72.00%)."

These values can be used to compute infection and mortality probabilities
among US healthcare professionals during the pandemic.

Probability of infection acquisition: 160860/1213744 ~= 13.3%

Probability of mortality from infection: 709/115817 ~= 0.61%

Given Singapore's aggressive COVID-19 pandemic response campaign, these
probabilities are likely to be substantially diminished compared to the US.

SwabBot Risks: SARS-CoV2 transmission from shared device reuse, injury from
nasal probe malfunction during sample acquisition, cross-sample
contamination.

Subject: Re: The future is cyborg (RISKS-32.27)

The numbers don't seem to tally. 63% average with 60% maximum?
Interestingly there is another independent report on the same
study, which gives other, more differentiated numbers:

https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252489134/Brits-more-fazed-by-human-augmentation

All other reports seem to be using the Reuters text.

Risk 1: The study itself is not available, so there is no way
        to see which numbers are correct.
Risk 2: A big agency being parroted by all others, drowning out
        a differing opinion.

This equates 'considering' with 'supporting'. It would be difficult to form
