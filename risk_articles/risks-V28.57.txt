Subject: Software says "'Dr' Must Be Male"!

There's a column-filler item in today's local newspaper (can't see it
on-line) about one Dr Louise Selby, a pediatrician, who registered with a
gym club in Cambridge, England.  She found that her security code wouldn't
allow her access to the ladies' changing room.  Problem turned out to be the
gym's membership software, which assumed that anybody with the title 'Dr'
was male; only work-round was for her to use another title.  The gym club
apologised and said that it was bought-in software (not named), adding that
they hadn't specified this feature and hoped to fix it.

  [In Germany, if her husband were also a Dr, she would be Frau Doktor
  Doktor Selby, and presumably German software would have no problem
  with that.  PGN]

Subject: Computer "glitch" meant info not shared with defense lawyers

The articles aren't completely clear to me, but it seems that a commercial
product called I/Leads used in Washington DC brings together data from
multiple police data sources, for required sharing with defense attorneys.
However, the program doesn't bring all the data in that it should, meaning
that defense attorneys were missing access to data which could have affected
their cases.  The prosecutors are now reviewing the cases to see what was
left out to determine it was substantive; defense attorneys say that's not
for the prosecutors to decide.

``Police described the missing information as mostly administrative and
redundant, and prosecutors agree that some could be found in other easily
accessible reports. But prosecutors said that omitted data also included
detailed descriptions by officers of suspects' appearance, demeanor, and
attitude -- information lawyers on both sides of courtroom could find
crucial.''

On the one hand, leaving out information that might be relevant is obviously
a big problem.  On the other hand, it's only because the information is
computerized that it's even feasible to gather all together.  Doubtless
defense attorneys have far more information from police files now than they
had a few decades ago, as a result of computerization.

Defense attorneys are asking the court for more information about what went
wrong.

<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/09/AR2009040904300.html>

"U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan set a March 27 deadline for the
U.S. Attorney's Office to report on the government's understanding of the
extent to which the problem could affect any of about two dozen federal
criminal cases pending before him and filed since 2011. Prosecutors were
also told to explain decisions to disclose or not to disclose any piece of
information that is found to have been withheld."

I've seen nothing to indicate whether the problem is generic to the I/Leads
software, or if it's something unique to the Washington DC configuration of
the software.

One item I found puzzling, but not specifically related to this problem,
was a statement that I/Leads "which went online in 2012, is being replaced
starting in August 2015."  That seems like an awfully short lifespan for a
system of this sort, given the usual timelines for developing
enterprise-type systems.

  Protect Freedom of Expression Worldwide

New 'Best Practice' Roadmap to Protect Rights and Promote Innovation Manila
-- An international coalition launched the Manila Principles on Internet
Liability today -- a roadmap for the global community to protect online
freedom of expression and innovation around the world.

Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Senior Global Policy Analyst Jeremy
Malcolm, who helped spearhead the principles: ``All communication across the
Internet is facilitated by intermediaries: service providers, social
networks, search engines, and more.  These services are all routinely asked
to take down content, and their policies for responding are often muddled,
heavy-handed, or inconsistent.  That results in censorship and the limiting
of people's rights...  Our goal is to protect everyone's freedom of
expression with a framework of safeguards and best practices for responding
to requests for content removal.''  [...]

The principles and supporting documents can be found online at
https://www.manilaprinciples.org <https://www.manilaprinciples.org/>, where
other organizations and members of the public can also express their own
endorsement of the principles.

  "The bogus transport layer security certificates are trusted by all major

  public key pinning prevented the Chrome and Firefox browsers from
  accepting those that vouched for the authenticity of Google properties,
  Google security engineer Adam Langley wrote in a blog post published
  Monday. The certificates were issued by Egypt-based MCS Holdings, an
  intermediate certificate authority that operates under the China Internet
  Network Information Center (CNNIC). The Chinese domain registrar and
  certificate authority, in turn, is included in root stores for virtually
  all OSes and browsers.  The issuance of the unauthorized certificates

Subject: FTC opens new office to protect you from the Internet of Things

[source: The Verge, 23 Mar 2015]

FTC opens new office to protect you from the Internet of Things
http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/23/8278127/ftc-office-technology-research-investigation-otri-announced

The FTC says it'll be broadening its scope with the launch of a new Office
of Technology Research and Investigation, described by the agency as "the
next generation in consumer protection." The new division succeeds and
replaces the FTC's current Mobile Technology Unit, which focused on
safeguarding children from deceptive mobile apps and overseeing other
smartphone-centric topics.

But technology never sits still. In 2015, we're faced with the growing
Internet of Things cars that get faster with software updates and the
expanding smart home. The FTC thinks now's the time to widen its net so that
it may protect consumer interest across every facet of
technology. Specifically, the OTRI will keep an eye on "privacy, data
security, connected cars, smart homes, algorithmic transparency, emerging
payment methods, big data, and the Internet of Things," according to the
agency.

"We believe OTRI will be an instrumental source for research and information
on technology's impact on consumers," wrote chief technologist Ashkan
Soltani in a blog post. Along with announcing the new office, the FTC says
it'll be recruiting new technologists and opening up other positions as
well. Among those is a Technology Policy Research Fellowship, which is aimed
at recent graduates "with that rare education in both technology and
policy." In this role, among other duties, fellows will "provide technical
expertise to FTC attorneys and investigators" -- probably to make sure they
never publicly say anything foolish. As part of the changes, the FTC says it
will be inviting more staff to publish posts on its Tech@FTC blog "about
technical research findings and technology related issues affecting
consumers."

ACM TechNews, Monday, March 23, 2015
(c) 2015 INFORMATION, INC.
This service may be reproduced for internal distribution.

Kim Zetter, *WiReD* News, 20 Mar 2015

Two security researchers have demonstrated proof-of-concept malware capable
of remotely infecting the BIOS chips of multiple systems.  Xeno Kovah and
Corey Kallenberg, former defense contractors who founded their own BIOS
security firm, demonstrated their malware last week at the CanSecWest
security conference in Vancouver, British Columbia.  The malware, which they
call LightEater, uses several incursion vulnerabilities to gain access to
the system management mode (SMM) on systems with Intel processors.  Access
to the SMM enables the malware to gain escalated privileges above and beyond
administrator and root-level access.  With this access, the malware can
rewrite the contents of the BIOS chip that makes the infection persistent
and stealthy.  From there, the malware can install rootkits, steal
passwords, and access data on the system.  It also is capable of reading
data from the system's memory, which means it potentially could subvert
systems using the Tails operating system used by journalists and others
attempting to maintain secrecy.  Kovah and Kallenberg say they have
contacted the manufacturers of the vulnerable systems they have identified
and patches are forthcoming.  However, there is a very weak track record of
users applying BIOS patches even when they are made available.

Wired via NNSquad
http://www.wired.com/2015/03/researchers-uncover-way-hack-bios-undermine-secure-operating-systems/

  "Their malware, dubbed LightEater, uses the incursion vulnerabilities to
  break into and hijack the system management mode to gain escalated
  privileges on the system. System management mode, or SMM, is an operations
  mode in Intel processors that firmware uses to do certain functions with
  high-level system privileges that exceed even administrative and
  root-level privileges, Kovah notes. Using this mode, they can rewrite the
  contents of the BIOS chip to install an implant that gives them a
  persistent and stealth foothold. From there, they can install root kits
  and steal passwords and other data from the system.  But more
  significantly, SMM gives their malware the ability to read all data and
  code that appears in a machine's memory. This would allow their malware,
  Kovah points out, to subvert any computer using the Tails operating
  system--the security and privacy-oriented operating system Edward Snowden
  and journalist Glenn Greenwald used to handle NSA documents Snowden
  leaked. By reading data in memory, they could steal the encryption key of
  a Tails user to unlock encrypted data or swipe files and other content as
  it appears in memory. Tails is meant to be run from a secure USB flash
  drive or other removable media--so that conceivably it won't be affected
  by viruses or other malware that may have infected the computer. It
  operates in the computer's memory and once the operating system is shut
  down, Tails scrubs the RAM to erase any traces of its activity. But
  because the LightEater malware uses the system management mode to read the
  contents of memory, it can grab the data while in memory before it gets
  scrubbed and store it in a safe place from which it can later be
  exfiltrated. And it can do this while all the while remaining stealth."

Surprised? You shouldn't be.

Cisco posts kit to empty houses to dodge NSA chop shops;
Kit sent to SmallCo of Nowheresville to avoid NSA interception profiles

Cisco will ship boxes to vacant addresses in a bid to foil the NSA, security
chief John Stewart says.  The dead-drop shipments help to foil a
Snowden-revealed operation whereby the NSA would intercept networking kit
and install backdoors before boxes reached customers.

The interception campaign was revealed last May.

Speaking at a Cisco Live press panel in Melbourne today, Stewart says the
Borg will ship to fake identities for its most sensitive customers, in the
hope that the NSA's interceptions are targeted.

"We ship [boxes] to an address that's has nothing to do with the customer,
and then you have no idea who ultimately it is going to," Stewart says.

"When customers are truly worried ... it causes other issues to make
[interception] more difficult in that [agencies] don't quite know where that
router is going so its very hard to target - you'd have to target all of
them.

There is always going to be inherent risk."

Stewart says some customers drive up to a distributor and pick up hardware
at the door.

He says nothing could guarantee protection against the NSA, however.  "If
you had a machine in an airtight area ... I stop the controls by which I
mitigate risk when I ship it," he says, adding that hardware technologies
can make malicious tampering "incredibly hard".

Cisco has poked around its routers for possible spy chips, but to date has
not found anything because it necessarily does not know what NSA taps may
look like, according to Stewart.

After the hacking campaign Borg boss John Chambers wrote a letter to US
President Barack Obama saying the spying would undermine the global tech
industry.

Subject: Re: As We Age, Smartphones Don't Make Us Stupid ... (LW, RISKS 28.56)

Mr. Weinstein:

Regarding your post "As We Age, Smartphones Don't Make Us Stupid -- They're
Our Saviors", I have a *partial* rebuttal which will be appearing on my
blog.

I am also putting this on my blog for release on 12:03 PM PDT on Wednesday.
(http://genew.ca/2015/03/25/re-as-we-age-smartphones-dont-make-us-stupid-theyre-our-saviors/).

***** Start of Blog Post *****
[...] Mr. Weinstein's article "As We Age, Smartphones Don't Make Us Stupid
-- They're Our Saviors" appeared in RISKS-28.56 and on his Website at
http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/001094.html.

He starts: "Throughout human history, pretty much every development or
invention that increased our information storage and management capabilities
has had its loud and voracious naysayers." and gives historical examples.

Another paragraph is, 'The crux of most arguments against having quick
access to information seem to largely parallel the attempts not that many
years ago (and in some venues, still continuing) to routinely ban
calculators from physics and other similar subject tests, on the grounds
that not doing the math by hand was somehow -- perhaps in a moral judgment
"You'll go to hell!" kind of sense -- horribly cheating.'

I can see his point, but I also see the other side.  The benefits of a new
method of dealing with things can be loudly touted while the disadvantages
are ignored.

I had an example of this in university.  For one of my courses, the
instructor stated, near the beginning of the course, that he was considering
allowing us to use laptops on the midterm and the final exams.  No Net
connection would be allowed, but each student could put whatever data he
wanted on his systems.  We already would be allowed to bring whatever hard
copy we wanted.

The idea of this was very popular with the students in the back row in
class: the ones who sat there because then they could plug in their systems.

The midterm came and went.  I noticed a couple weeks after that we had not
had the option of using computers.  Since it was of no interest to me, I
shrugged.  The topic came up again near the end of the course.  There was a
lot of racket from the students who wanted to use computers.  I finally
managed to get a word in edgewise that I was concerned that an exam could
favour computer use and that I did not think that I should have to spend
several hundred dollars (more) to write a final.  The instructor said that
that would be considered.  Since he was straightshooter, I left it at that.

On Thursday of the first week of exams, it was time to write the final for
this course.  I brought my course notes and assignments as well as three
textbooks that I had and thought might be of use.  The exam looked
reasonable, and I got to it.  I only had to refer to my materials a few
times.  I left figuring that I had done quite well.

Wait, wait, wait.

A week later, I still had not seen my grade up.  I was on campus and ran
across the instructor and asked how it was going.  He must have just
finished the marking.  He told me (words are a close paraphrase), "I've got
two things to tell you. In general, the students who did not use computers
did better than those who did, and two, you got the only A+."

Naturally, I was pleased with the A+, but why the difference between the two
groups?  I puzzled over it for a few months and finally came up with what I
think is the reason.

I minored in Math, and on a course on linear programming, I was studying for
the midterm with another student.  We were trying a question, and it just
was not working out.  We decided to check the text.  The other student was
looking at it for a few minutes and did not figure it out, so I asked to
have a look.  There was a section that I thought was wrong or ambiguous.  I
suggested reading it a bit differently than we had.  That turned out to be
it.

If we had not done this, but had instead referred to the text during the
exam, we would have lost time.  It is no surprise to me now why students in
the other course who used computers did not do so well.  It is one thing to
look something up like the capital of California, but it is quite another
when one has to understand the material that one finds more than trivially.

I think that people who rely overly on computers can all too easily
shortchange themselves.  ***** End of Blog Post *****
