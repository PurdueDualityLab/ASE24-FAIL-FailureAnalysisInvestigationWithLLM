Subject: Connected Car Security

Connecting cars to the Internet and cloud-based services has clear benefits
for both drivers and passengers with features ranging from navigation
systems with live search functions to streaming audio options. But along
with connectivity comes a certain level of risks -- cybersecurity concerns
recently exposed in hacks of a Jeep SUV and the Nissan Leaf EV (electric
vehicle).

Now, experts say, the same connectivity may also offer a solution to this
cybersecurity problem, in the form of over-the-air updates. And better
computing power in a vehicle could offer a panacea, as well.

http://cta.tech/i3/Features/2016/May-June/Connected-Car-Security.aspx

Over-the-air updates, great. Think of Windows update fun brought to cars.
I'd love to try starting my car in the morning only to find it's been
bricked.  Or features a changed UI. Plus a juicy target for hackers.  I see
a market for garage-sized Faraday cages, plus controversy about the wisdom
of rooting your car.

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0, ZDNet, 4 Apr 2016
Home automation firm Nest is planning to pull the plug on old Revolv
smart hubs, effectively bricking these devices.

Gilbert is also frustrated that he was never emailed about the planned

Subject: Are tighter rules needed on recording devices in cars?

It may be 2016, but many cars in Canada have a bit of George Orwell's novel
Nineteen Eighty-Four in them.

Most vehicles built since the early 2000s contain event data recorders that
silently log everything, such as braking, speed, steering and whether a
seatbelt is buckled.

Initially created to improve safety and car performance, the devices have
become a tool for police to reconstruct crash scenes and for insurance
companies to assign accident blame.  [...]

Clearer rules could be on the way

The Canadian Automobile Association advocates on issues that are a concern
to its members and the motoring public.

The CAA says there is lobbying around this issue happening at the federal
level.

"The Privacy Commission of Canada has determined that this is an important
issue to tackle and they are approaching it with motorists organizations
like ours, with manufacturers and with possible legislation," said Gary
Howard, spokesman for CAA Atlantic.

MacKay says as more of what we do is recorded, our laws have been slow to
catch up to protect our privacy. Iny agrees the technology is moving very
swiftly.

"There are plenty of vehicles with onboard systems that can communicate in
real time, all the time with the car maker. They know where you are and
they'll know how you're driving. That's much more invasive."

He says cars are turning into a "permanent antenna" that can be used for
"collecting, transmitting and receiving data about itself all the time."

Subject: Catch 22 in the Courtrooms: FBI and Tor malware (Cyrus Farivar)

  [Computer security seems full of Catch 22 problems...  WU]

Cyrus Farivar, Ars Technica, 19 May 2016
<http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/05/judge-says-suspect-has-right-to-review-code-that-fbi-has-right-to-keep-secret/>

Judge says suspect has right to review code that FBI has right to keep
secret.  At issue is Tor malware that enabled the FBI to bust child porn
ring.

A US federal judge in Tacoma, Washington has put himself in a Catch 22:
ruling a man charged with possessing child pornography has the right to
review malware source code while also acknowledging that the government has
a right to keep it secret.

"The resolution of Defendant's Third Motion to Compel Discovery places this
matter in an unusual position: the defendant has the right to review the
full NIT code, but the government does not have to produce it," US District
Judge Robert Bryan wrote on Wednesday.
<https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2839367-Michaud-5-18-16.html>
"Thus, we reach the question of sanctions: What should be done about it
when, under these facts, the defense has a justifiable need for information
in the hands of the government, but the government has a justifiable right
not to turn the information over to the defense?"

In this case, the defense wants prosecutors to disclose the full source code
of the NIT, or network investigative technique -- a piece of
government-created malware that compromised Tor and exposed users of a
Tor-only child porn site. The Department of Justice did so in a related case
<https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2828710-Michaud-tues2.html#document/p5/a2>
in Nebraska, *United States v. Cottom*, but a DoJ spokesman now says this
case, *United States v. Michaud,* and *Cottom* are entirely different cases
and have no bearing on one another.

As Ars has reported previously, since defense lawyer Colin Fieman filed his
third motion to compel discovery in January 2016, there have been two other
judges overseeing related cases in different states that have ruled to
suppress evidence found as a result of the NIT. Those cases, in Oklahoma and
Massachusetts, have been significantly hindered as a result. (Earlier this
month, a defense attorney in West Virginia filed a new motion to withdraw a
guilty plea based on these other rulings.) These cases comprise a small
handful in a group of 135 that have so far been prosecuted.
<https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2829139-Motion-to-Compel-Michaud.html>
<https://motherboard.vice.com/read/playpen-hack-FBI-child-pornography-investigation>
<https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2824556-Defendant-s-Motion-to-Withdraw-Plea-Michael.html>

In early 2015, investigators used this NIT malware to penetrate the digital
security of Tor users accused of accessing the Tor-hidden child pornography
site called "Playpen." In yet another related case prosecuted out of New
York, an FBI search warrant affidavit described both the types of child
pornography available to Playpen's 150,000 members and the malware's
capabilities.
<https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2166606-ferrell-warrant-1.html>
<https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2166606-ferrell-warrant-1.html#document/p11/a227236>

You can't have it both ways.  Brian Owsley, a former federal judge who is
now a law professor at the University of North Texas, said that such a
conundrum is "not that uncommon." He pointed to a 1957 Supreme Court
decision, *Jencks v. United States*, which involved an undercover informant
and an alleged Communist who demanded government records from the
investigation.

"The judge solves this problem by dismissing the charge against the
defendant if the government does not want to release the code for the
network investigative technique in this case based on an assertion of
privilege," Owsley said by e-mail. "This enables the government to
prioritize how important it is to maintain these documents. If the release
truly would jeopardize national security or some other greater good as in
this case, then the government must accept the dismissal of its prosecution
of the one defendant for that greater good. So either the government will
blink and allow the defendant access to the NIT code or the court may
dismiss the indictment."

Ahmed Ghappour <http://www.uchastings.edu/faculty/ghappour/index.php>, a law
professor at the University of California, Hastings, came to a similar
conclusion. "The judge has already ruled that the source code is material to
the defense, and the government has not made a sufficient showing that
access to the source code cannot be used by the defense to mount a
challenge," he wrote.

Judge Bryan is set to hold another hearing on this issue next week.

Dronebuster will let you point and shoot command hacks at pesky drones
<http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/05/dronebuster-will-let-you-point-and-shoot-command-hacks-at-pesky-drones/>

Not exactly a jammer, the "gun" exploits library of drone control protocols

Anti-drone technology has been high on the shopping list of public safety
and military organizations at least since a drunken federal employee crashed
a drone onto the White House lawn. Two companies on hand at the Navy League
Sea Air Space Exposition here this week had two slightly different
approaches to the problem. One anti-drone device has already been deployed
in the hands of federal law enforcement and the military, and a "street
legal" version may be coming soon.

The drone "killer" getting the most attention at Sea Air Space was the
DroneDefender, a system developed by researchers at the nonprofit research
and development organization Battelle. DroneDefender is a two-pronged drone
jammer -- it can disrupt command-and-control signals from a remote operator
or disrupt automatic GPS or GLONASS guidance, depending on which of the
devices' two triggers is pulled.
<http://www.battelle.org/our-work/national-security/tactical-systems/battelle-dronedefender>,

Powered by a small backpack, DroneDefender looks like some futuristic
over-under, radio-frequency shotgun-grenade launcher. Targeted through a
simple optical sight, the device has a range of about 400 meters. Battelle
calls it a "directed RF energy weapon".  It sends out a jamming signal in
the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) bands or global positioning
bands in a 30-degree cone around the point of aim.

Aboard the Department of Defense's Stiletto "marine demonstrator" boat
<http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/05/ars-climbs-aboard-the-stiletto-dods-stealthy-high-speed-lab-at-sea/>,
Jake Sullivan was showing off his company's own counter-drone "gun," the
Dronebuster. Sullivan, chief technology officer of California-based Flex
Force <http://flexforce.us/>, said that his company began development of
Dronebuster shortly after drones interfered with firefighters in California
last year. The intent was to develop something for first-responders and
local law enforcement.

A version of the Dronebuster is already in the hands of some federal
government customers. That device uses broadband jamming like the
DroneDefender. It has the advantage of being much smaller than the
DroneDefender, and it can be aimed using optical sights or an integrated
radio frequency power meter and signal analyzer. Someone trained on the
device can even distinguish what kind of signal is being emitted from the
drone telemetry (such as remote video streaming) or control. Still, its
jamming technology makes it illegal to use in the US.

But a new version being developed by Flex Force operates completely within
FCC regulations, though depending on what kind of drone is targeted, the new
device may require an FCC license. Instead of jamming C&C signals, the new
Dronebuster exploits weaknesses in the drone communications protocols
themselves, enabling the Dronebuster's operator to trigger the "fly home"
command on some drones and the "land" command on others. It does so by
cycling through command sets for various drone systems.

In the system currently being developed, GPS and GLONASS jamming are
available through an add-on card available only to federal customers.
Pending FCC approval of the product, Dronebuster could soon be made more
widely available to local agencies and other customers.

 An anonymous reader quotes a Japanese newspaper
: *Police suspect that the cash was withdrawn at ATMs using counterfeit
credit cards containing account information leaked from a South African
bank <http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20160522/p2g/00m/0dm/044000c>.
Japanese police will work with South African authorities through the

Subject: The risk of blaming the messenger

Way too often, people think that data is secure when in fact it is not.
Simply because some data is hiding behind an API does not mean it is not
public. That data is available to anybody who wants.

People who expose dataleaks like this, often get critiqued by the public.
The public can be forgiven when they call it hacking when someone simply
asks a database server for a full-record whereas the in-browser "app" would
anonymize or redact the presented information.

This is a dangerous situation where developers seem to think: "if I can't
hack it nobody can", or "nobody is smart enough to query the database
themselves".  All it takes is one smart guy to write "an app for that".

It depends on specific circumstances if the "leak" gets reported to the
company or not. Sometimes the reporting person gets thrown in jail for
"hacking", sometimes not. I think that blaming the messenger is not a
productive way for improving the world. Do this enough and people who notice
leaks will think twice before they report it.

Namecalling the messenger is IMHO not helping:

> It's arrogant jerks like the asses behind this data scraping...(*)

(*) Source withheld as an example. Who said that? It's public
information.  If you want to know, just google it.

Subject: Edward Snowden, John Crane, and Whistle-Blowing
  (McLaughlin/Froomkin)

Jenna McLaughlin and Dan Froomkin, The Intercept, 23 May 2016
Vindication for Edward Snowden From a New Player in NSA Whistleblowing Saga

U.S. officials, including President Barack Obama and Democratic front-runner
Hillary Clinton, have insisted that Snowden should and could have gone
through channels -- and would have been heard.  John Crane brings
unprecedented evidence from inside the system that ostensibly protects
whistleblowers that the system isn't working. And defenders of the system
can't accuse him of having an outside agenda.

*The Guardian* published a stunning new chapter in the saga of NSA
whistleblowers on Sunday, revealing a new key player: John Crane, a former
assistant inspector general at the Pentagon who was responsible for
protecting whistleblowers, then forced to become one himself when the
process failed.  An article by Mark Hertsgaard, adapted from his new book,
Bravehearts: Whistle Blowing in the Age of Snowden, describes how former NSA
official Thomas Drake went through proper channels in his attempt to expose
civil-liberties violations at the NSA -- and was punished for it. The
article vindicates open-government activists who have long argued that
whistleblower protections aren't sufficient in the national security realm.
It vindicates NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden who, well aware of what
happened to Drake, gave up his attempts to go through traditional
whistleblower channels -- and instead handed over his trove of classified
documents directly to journalists.  And it adds to the vindication for
Drake, who was already a hero in the whistleblower's pantheon for having
endured a four-year persecution by the Justice Department that a judge
called *unconscionable*.  The case against Drake, who was initially charged
with 10 felony counts of espionage, famously disintegrated before trial --
but not before he was professionally and financially ruined.  And now it
turns out that going through official channels may have actually set off the
chain of events that led to his prosecution.  Drake initially took his
concerns about wasteful, illegal, and unconstitutional actions by the NSA to
high-ranking NSA officials, then to appropriate staff and members of
Congress. When that didn't work, he signed onto a whistleblower complaint to
the Pentagon inspector general made by some recently retired NSA
staffers. But because he was still working at the NSA, he asked the office
to keep his participation anonymous.  Now, Hertsgaard writes that Crane
alleges that his former colleagues in the inspector general's office
revealed Drake's identity to the Justice Department; then they withheld (and
perhaps destroyed) evidence after Drake was indicted; finally, they lied
about all this to a federal judge.  Crane's growing concerns about his
office's conduct pushed him to his breaking point, according to Hertsgaard.
But his supervisors ignored his concerns, gave him the silent treatment, and
finally forced him to resign in January 2013.  Due to Crane's continued
efforts, however, the Department of Justice has opened an investigation into
the Department of Defense for its treatment of whistleblowers, and
Hertsgaard tells The Intercept that a public report on the results of the
investigation is expected next year.  Crane brings unprecedented evidence
from inside the system that ostensibly protects whistleblowers that the
system isn't working. And defenders of the system can't accuse him of having
an outside agenda. Crane has never taken a position for or against the NSA's
programs, or made contact with Drake during the investigation.  ``Crane kind
of made it a point not to know him,'' Hertsgaard told The Intercept on
Monday.  ``He didn't want it to become something personal.''  For him, it
was about whistleblowing, Hertsgaard explained, and the principle that
``anonymity must be absolutely sacred.''  Snowden told *The Guardian* that
Drake's persecution was very much on his mind when he decided to go outside
normal channels. And he told TheGuardian that colleagues and supervisors
warned him about raising his concerns, telling him, ``You're playing with
fire.''  In his *Guardian* interview, Snowden called for changes.  ``We need
iron-clad, enforceable protections for whistleblowers, and we need a public
record of success stories.  Protect the people who go to members of Congress
with oversight roles, and if their efforts lead to a positive change in
policy, recognize them for their efforts. There are no incentives for people
to stand up against an agency on the wrong side of the law today, and that's
got to change.'' U.S. officials, including President Barack Obama and
Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, have insisted that Snowden should
and could have gone through channels -- and would have been heard.  ``When
people look at Edward Snowden, he's the most famous,'' Hertsgaard told The
Intercept.  ``What they don't realize is just how exceptional he is. He
actually got his message out and he lived to tell the tale.  That is highly
unusual.  In most cases, whistleblowers pay with their lives to save ours.''
Hertsgaard writes in his book about many other whistleblowers whose stories
are slightly less dramatic, but no less important.  ``I'm hoping campaign
reporters will press Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump on
this,'' he said.

Subject: Student Exposes Bad Police Encryption, Gets Sentenced (EditorDavid)

EditorDavid on Slashdot, May 22)

[ ...Known Dangers of Whistle-Blowing... odd that a computer security
"expert" should not know... ! ]

<https://yro.slashdot.org/story/16/05/22/0057256/student-exposes-bad-police-encryption-gets-suspended-sentence>

Dejan Ornig, a security analyst in Slovenia warned the Slovenian police
department about vulnerabilities in their supposedly secure communication
system TETRA in 2013. (Here's Google's English translation
<javascript:void(0)> of the article, and the Slovenian original
<https://podcrto.si/odkritelju-ranljivosti-sistema-tetra-leto-in-tri-mesece-pogojne-zaporne-kazni/>.)

He discovered that the system, which was supposed to provide encrypted
communication, was incorrectly configured. As a result lots of communication
could be intercepted with a $25 piece of equipment and some software. To
make matters worse, the system is not used just by the police, but also by
the military, military police, IRS, Department of Corrections and a few
other governmental institutions which rely on secure communications.

After waiting for more than two years for a reaction, from police or
Ministry of Interior and getting in touch with security researchers at the
prestigious institute Jozef Stefan, he eventually decided to go public with
his story... The police and Ministry of interior then launched an internal
investigation, which then confirmed Ornig's findings and revealed internal
communications problems between the departments... Ornig has been subject to
a house search by the police, during which his computers and equipment that
he used to listen in on the system were seized. Police also found a
"counterfeit police badge" during the investigation. All along Ornig was
offering his help with securing the system.

On May 11th Ornig received a prison sentence of 15 months suspended for
duration of three years, provided that he doesn't repeat any of the offenses
for which he was found guilty (illegal access of the communications
system). He can appeal this judgment.

Networkworld:

Researchers with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) have
quickly moved to alter the way the military, public and private enterprises
protect their networks from high-and low-speed distributed denial-of-service
attacks with a program called Extreme DDoS Defense
<http://www.darpa.mil/program/extreme-ddos-defense> (XD3). The agency has
since September awarded seven XD3 multi-million contracts
<http://www.networkworld.com/article/3073481/security/darpa-extreme-ddos-project-transforming-network-attack-mitigation.html>
to Georgia Tech, George Mason University, Invincea Labs, Raytheon BBN,
Vencore Labs (two contracts) and this week to the University of Pennsylvania
to radically alter DDoS defenses. One more contract is expected under the
program. [DARPA says the XD3 program looks to develop technologies that:
Thwart DDoS attacks by dispersing cyber assets (physically and/or logically)
to complicate adversarial targeting, disguise the characteristics and
behaviors of those assets to confuse or deceive the adversary, blunt the
effects of attacks that succeed in penetrating other defensive measures by
using adaptive mitigation techniques on endpoints such as mission-critical
servers.]

Foul-Mouthed Worm Takes Control Of Wireless ISPs Around the Globe
<https://it.slashdot.org/story/16/05/20/1711201/foul-mouthed-worm-takes-control-of-wireless-isps-around-the-globe>

Dan Goodin, reporting for Ars Technica (edited and condensed):

ISPs around the world are being attacked by self-replicating malware that
can take complete control of widely used wireless networking equipment,
according to reports from customers. San Jose, California-based Ubiquiti
Networks confirmed recently that attackers are actively targeting a flaw in
AirOS, the Linux-based firmware that runs the wireless routers, access
points, and other gear sold by the company. The vulnerability, which allows
attackers to gain access to the devices over HTTP and HTTPS connections
without authenticating themselves, was patched last July, but the fix wasn't
widely installed. Many customers claimed they never received notification of
the threat.

ISPs in Argentina, Spain, Brazil have been attacked by the worm,
said Nico Waisman, a research at security firm Immunity, adding that it's
likely that ISPs in the U.S. and other places have also been attacked by the
same malware. From the report, "Once successful, the exploit he examined
replaces the password files of an infected device and then scans the network
it's on for other vulnerable gear. After a certain amount of time, the worm
resets infected devices to their factory default configurations, with the
exception of leaving behind a backdoor account, and then disappears."

<http://news.softpedia.com/news/tor-to-use-never-seen-before-distributed-rng-to-generate-truly-random-numbers-504461.shtml>

Devs test new Tor RNG algorithm at last week's meeting May 25, 2016 08:45

<http://news.softpedia.com/editors/browse/catalin-cimpanu>

Tor developers have been working on the next iteration of the Tor network
and its underbelly, the Onion routing protocol, in order to create a
stronger, harder-to-crack anonymous communications system.....

Future Tor communications will be more secure

The team says it implemented a new mechanism for generating random numbers,
never before seen on the Internet.

In secure communications and encryption, random numbers are of critical
importance,serving as the base for generating encryption keys. The stronger
the algorithm on which the random number is generated, the harder it is...to
crack and guess the number based on known patterns.

The Tor Project says it created something it calls "a distributed RNG"
(random number generator) that uses two or more computers to create a random
number and then blends these outputs. The end result is something that's
impossible to crack without knowing which computers from a network
contributed to the final random number, and which entropy each one used.

Not even Tor devs can predict the output of the new distributed RNG

Tor devs finished the new distributed RNG system a few months back, and at
the Montreal meeting, the Tor team tested it on a network with eleven Tor
routers. Currently, the distributed RNG is in the code review and auditing
stage.

Subject: France's Guillotining of Global Free Speech Continues

http://lauren.vortex.com/2016/05/frances-guillotining-of-global-free-speech-continues

The war between France and Google -- with France demanding that Google act
as a global censor, and Google appealing France's edicts -- shows no signs
of abating, and the casualty list could easily end up including most of this
planet's residents.

As soon as the horrific "Right To Be Forgotten" (RTBF) concept was initially
announced by the EU, many observers (including myself) suspected that the
"end game" would always be global censorship, despite efforts by Google and
others to reach agreements that could limit EU censorship to the EU itself.

This is the heart of the matter. France -- and shortly we can be sure a
parade of such free speech loathing countries like Russia, China, and many
others -- is demanding that Google remove search results for third-party
materials on a global basis from all Google indexes around the world.

What this means is that even though I'm sitting right here in Los Angeles,
if I dare to write a completely accurate and USA-legal post that the French
government finds objectionable, France is demanding the right to force
Google (and ultimately, other search engines and indexes) to remove key
references to my posting from Google and other search results. For
everyone. Everywhere. Around the world. Because of ... France.

It's nonsensical on its face but incredibly dangerous. It's a dream of every
dictator and legions of bureaucrats down through history, brought to a shiny
21st century technological reality.

You don't have to be a computer scientist to realize that if every country
in the world has a veto power over global search results, the lightspeed
race to the lowest common denominator of sickly search results pablum would
make Einstein's head spin.

Proponents of these censorship regimes play the usual sorts of duplicitous
word games of censorship czars throughout history. They claim it's for the
good of all, and that it's not "really" censorship since "only" search
results are involved.

Well here's something you can take to the bank. Let's leave aside for the
moment the absolute truth that -- given the enormous scale of the Web --
hiding search results is effectively largely the same as hiding most source
content itself as far as most people are concerned. But even if we ignore
this fact, the truth of the matter is that it won't be long before these
same governments are also demanding the direct censorship of source material
websites as well as search results.

However small the "forbidden information" leakage past the censorship of
search results themselves, government censors will never be satisfied. They
never are. In the history of civilization, they've never been satisfied.

A grand irony of course is that the very rise of Internet technology has
been the potential enabler of centrally-mandated censorship to a degree
never imagined even twenty years ago. For those of us who've spent our
professional lives working to build these systems to foster the open spread
of information, seeing our technologies turned into the tools of tyrants is
disheartening to say the least.

It is however encouraging that firms like Google are continuing to fight the
good fight against governments' censorship regimes. Frankly, it will take
firms on the scale of Google -- along with support by masses of ordinary
folks like us -- to have any chance at all of keeping France and other
governments around the world from turning the Internet into their own
personal information control fiefdoms.

Subject: "Why Free Speech Is Even More Important Than Privacy"

http://lauren.vortex.com/2016/05/why-free-speech-is-even-more-important-than-privacy

Supporters of the EU's horrific "Right To Be Forgotten" (RTBF) generally
make the implicit (and sometimes explicit) argument that privacy must take
precedence over free speech.

As a privacy advocate for many years (I created my ongoing PRIVACY Forum in
1992) you might expect that I'd have at least some sympathy for that
position.

Such an assumption would be incorrect. At least in the context of censorship
in general -- and of RTBF in particular -- I disagree strongly with such
assertions.

It's not because privacy is unimportant. In fact, I feel that free speech is
more important than privacy precisely because privacy itself is so
important!

It's all a matter of what you know, what you don't know, and what you don't
know that you don't know.

Basically, there are two categories of censorship.

The first consists largely of materials that you know exist, but that you
are forbidden by (usually government) edict from accessing. Such items may
in practice be difficult to obtain, or simple to obtain, but in either case
may carry significant legal penalties if you actually obtain them (or in
some cases, even try to obtain them). An obvious example of this category is
sexually-explicit materials of various sorts around the world.

Ironically, while this category could encompass everything from classic
erotic literature to the most depraved pornography involving children,
overall it is the lesser insidious form of censorship, since at least you
know that it exists.

The even more evil type of censorship -- the sort that is fundamental to the
"Right To be Forgotten" concept and an essential element of George Orwell's
"Nineteen Eighty-Four" -- is the effort to hide actual information in a
manner that would prevent you from even knowing that it exists in the first
place.

Whether it's a war with "Eastasia" or a personal past that someone would
prefer that you not know about, the goal is for you not to realize, to not
even suspect, that some negative information is out there that you might
consider to be relevant and important.

Combine this with the escalating RTBF demands of France and other countries
for global censorship powers over Google's and other firms' search results,
and it becomes clear why privacy itself can be decimated under RTBF and
similar forms of censorship.

Because if individual governments -- some of whom already impose draconian
information controls domestically -- gain global censorship powers, we can't
possibly assume that we even know what's really going on in respect to
negative impacts on our privacy!

In other words, RTBF and similar forms of censorship can act to hide from us
the very existence of entities, facts and efforts that could be directly
damaging to our privacy in a myriad number of ways.  And if we don't know
that these even exist, how can we possibly make informed evaluations of our
privacy and the privacy of our loved ones?

To make matters worse, much of this applies not only to privacy issues, but
to an array of crucial security issues as well.

Attempting to maintain privacy and security in a regime of global censorship
designed to hide facts from the public -- irrespective of the occasionally
laudable motives for such actions in some specific cases -- is like trying
to build a skyscraper on a foundation of quicksand.

You don't need to be an architect, a computer scientist -- or a privacy
expert -- to recognize the insanity of such an approach.

Android Malware Slowly Adapts to Marshmallow's New Permission Model
<http://news.softpedia.com/news/android-malware-slowly-adapts-t.o-marshmallow-s-new-permission-model-504536.shtml>
Android's new permission model doesn't deter malware coders.

Malware coders have adapted two Android trojans to cope with Marshmallow's
new user permission model, showing that despite Google's best efforts,
crooks will plow through all the company's security measures and still reach
their targets...

Google launched Marshmallow last year. One of the key security features
introduced with the mobile operating system was the new permission model
that allowed apps to require the necessary permissions at runtime when a
certain app function needed access to more data.

Initially, malware coders didn't like this because it spread out all their
malicious app's intrusive permissions across different popups, giving users
the opportunity to spot something wrong. But crooks are resilient, so they
adapted to adding the "target_sdk" attribute to the malicious app's code,
and giving it a value of less than 23. This value told Marshmallow to ask
for all permissions at installation, like on older Android OS versions.
Security vendors quickly noted this change, and took a closer look at
Marshmallow apps that employed this trick, Symantec reports
<http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/android-threats-evolve-handle-marshmallow-s-new-permission-model>
that two malware families, the dangerous *Android.Bankosy*
<http://news.softpedia.com/news/android-bankosy-trojan-steals-one-time-passwords-sent-to-you-via-voice-calls-498820.shtml>
banking trojan, and the Android.Cepsohord click-fraud bot, have evolved to
use the new permission model. Both ask users at runtime for permissions, as
they need them.

Malware coders are leveraging on popup fatigue.

Why malware coders decided to take this road resides in the profile of
infected victims. Most people that suffer from such virus infections aren't
technically trained experts, educated and experienced enough to spot such
threats; users just click through all permissions without reading them --
some just don't care about permissions anymore...

Ransomware developers have found another method of monetizing their

So instead of just encrypting your files and locking your screen, new
ransomware versions seen this week also started adding a DDoS bot that
quietly blasts spoofed network traffic at various IPs on the Internet.*
Softpedia <http://news.softpedia.com/> points out that "Renting out DDoS
botnets on the Dark Web is a very lucrative business, even if prices have
gone down in recent years."

Opera Becomes First Browser to Offer a Built-in VPN
<http://news.softpedia.com/news/opera-becomes-first-browser-to-offer-a-built-in-vpn-503258.shtml>
...first major browser to include a free VPN service in the standard
distribution.  *Developer Edition available for download*

Opera's quest for better user privacy controls

Using a VPN is recommended for users who would like to keep their privacy
while online, to avoid restrictive firewalls, to access blocked websites,
and to mask traffic on public wired or WiFi networks.

Lately, Opera has been very focused on adding privacy-enhancing features to
its browser, and Opera 37, the browser's current Beta release, is already
testing out a *built-in ad blocking
<http://news.softpedia.com/news/opera-37-0-web-browser-with-built-in-ad-blocker-lands-today-in-the-beta-channel-502427.shtml>*
module. Besides blocking ads, the native ad-blocker will also prevent
advertising companies from gathering information and fingerprinting users
online, yet another plus for user privacy.

If you've been following the browser scene since the mid-'90s, you won't be
surprised by this latest addition to Opera's core features, since Opera has
been pioneering and testing a large number of browser features before
anyone else.
You can download Opera 38 from its official website

<http://news.softpedia.com/news/Facebook-Said-to-Be-Interested-in-Opera-but-Don-t-Hold-Your-Breath-271846.shtml>
and the Chinese buyout, Opera switched from its proprietary rendering
engine to Google's Chromium core and even lost one of its founding members,
who went on to create his separate browser called Vivaldi.
Opera's future ownership doesn't instill trust

Opera's soon-to-be owner is an investment fund officially named "Golden
Brick Silk Road (Shenzhen) Equity Investment Fund II LLP." The fund is
backed by three major Chinese companies that include Qihoo 360, who also
publishes its own browser named 360 Secure Browser, gaming firm Kunlun, and
investment firm Yonglian.

During the past year, researchers from Citizen Lab have been investigating
and revealing major security and privacy issues with most of the Chinese
browsers, such as *UC Browser*

<http://news.softpedia.com/news/tor-to-use-never-seen-before-distributed-rng-to-generate-truly-random-numbers-504461.shtml>

Devs test new Tor RNG algorithm at last week's meeting May 25, 2016 08:45

<http://news.softpedia.com/editors/browse/catalin-cimpanu>

Tor developers have been working on the next iteration of the Tor network
and its underbelly, the Onion routing protocol, in order to create a
stronger, harder-to-crack anonymous communications system.....

Future Tor communications will be more secure

The team says it implemented a new mechanism for generating random numbers,
never before seen on the Internet.

In secure communications and encryption, random numbers are of critical
importance,serving as the base for generating encryption keys. The stronger
the algorithm on which the random number is generated, the harder it is...to
crack and guess the number based on known patterns.

The Tor Project says it created something it calls "a distributed RNG"
(random number generator) that uses two or more computers to create a random
number and then blends these outputs. The end result is something that's
impossible to crack without knowing which computers from a network
contributed to the final random number, and which entropy each one used.

Not even Tor devs can predict the output of the new distributed RNG

Tor devs finished the new distributed RNG system a few months back, and at
the Montreal meeting, the Tor team tested it on a network with eleven Tor
routers. Currently, the distributed RNG is in the code review and auditing
stage.

  Microsoft has faced criticism for changing the pop-up box encouraging
  Windows users to upgrade to Windows 10.  Clicking the red cross on the
  right hand corner of the pop-up box now activates the upgrade instead of
  closing the box.  And this has caused confusion as typically clicking a
  red cross closes a pop-up notification The upgrade could still be
  canceled, when the scheduled time for it to begin appeared, Microsoft
  said The change occurred because the update is now labeled "recommended"
  and many people have their PCs configured to accept recommended updates
  for security reasons.  This means dismissing the box does not dismiss the
  update.  Brad Chacos, senior editor at the PC World website, described it

Stanford Computer Scientists Show Telephone Metadata Can Reveal Surprisingly
  Sensitive Personal Information (Bjorn Carey via ACM TechNews)

Bjorn Carey, Stanford Report, 16 May 2016

An analysis of telephone metadata by Stanford University researchers found that data can clue people into a person's private information, while tracking "hops" from a single individual's communications can involve thousands of others.  The analysis entailed information collected by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), which can obtain metadata such as the numbers dialed and call length without a warrant.  The researchers constructed a smartphone application that retrieved the previous call and text message metadata from more than 800 volunteers' smartphone logs.  They then combined automated and manual processes to show how many people would be involved in a scan of a single person, and the level of sensitive information that can be inferred about each user.  A small sample of users enabled the researchers to surmise, for example, that a person who placed calls to a cardiologist, a local drugstore, and a cardiac arrhythmia-monitoring device hotline likely suffers from cardiac arrhythmia.  The researchers also estimated via extrapolation of participant data that the NSA's current authority could permit surveillance on about 25,000 people, if not more, starting from a single phone user metadata scan.  The researchers say their study contradicts the government's rationale for tapping metadata on the assumption it does not constitute sensitive information.

distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against NS1, a major DNS and
traffic management provider, for over a week. While the company has
essentially shunted off much of the attack traffic, NS1 experienced some
interruptions in service early last week. And the attackers have also gone
after partners of NS1, interrupting service to the company's website and
other services not tied to the DNS and traffic-management platform ...

  They compared their responses with those of people from Zhanggong they
  knew were from the 50 Cent Party because of the leaked email trove.  The
  two groups said "Yes" at almost exactly the same rate -- just under 60
  percent.  More generally, China has an extensive system of Internet
  controls, sometimes dubbed the "Great Firewall." Its Internet censorship
  was recently deemed a trade barrier by the U.S.  "Outright blocking of
  websites appears to have worsened over the past year, with eight of the
  top 25 most trafficked global sites now blocked in China," the U.S. Trade
  Representative said in a report released in April, according to
  Reuters. "Over the past decade, China's filtering of cross-border Internet
  traffic has posed a significant burden to foreign suppliers, hurting both
  Internet sites themselves, and users who often depend on them for their
  business."

Subject: "More than 22 BILLION vehicle photos in UK database"

Item in newspaper about UK vehicle number (licence) plate
cameras and details stored may be of interest:

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3607111/More-22-BILLION-number-plate-photos-stored-central-database-police-access-without-warrant-gets-34-million-new-images-day.html

  A police network of 'Big Brother' spy cameras takes photos of about
  34-million number plates each day, new figures have revealed.  Around
  9,000 surveillance cameras have been placed along Britain's roads and
  senior officers claim they are invaluable in preventing and solving
  serious crimes and terrorist attacks.

  Tony Porter, the independent surveillance camera commissioner, questioned
  the database's legality in a report.  He said: 'There is no statutory
  authority for the creation of the national ANPR database, its creation was
  never agreed by Parliament, and no report on its operation has even been
  laid before Parliament.'  Mr Porter's warning was troubling because police
  want to extend retention of details to seven years and DVLA officials
  could be permitted access to track down road tax cheats - increasing the
  risk of data being abused.

("DVLA" is UK's national motor vehicles registry, "ANPR" is
Automatic Number (licence) Plate Recognition.)

As ever, "if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear" (ha!).
Apart from errors of mis-reading plates optically due to dirt, poor light,
etc., main RISK is probably unknowingly driving in the vicinity of a crime
scene, then being pulled in by the cops (possibly some years later) and
being asked to account for your movements.

Subject: Re: Video Exposes Officials' Mistakes but Can't Undo Blown Calls. Yet.

The New York Times article on video evidence in top sport events takes a
(narrow-minded) US centric view in more than one way. According to the
article officials can't correct mistakes in a hockey game using video
evidence. But nothing is further from the truth. International hockey (not
ice-hockey) matches have been using video refereeing for years now. This is
a huge success.  See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(field_hockey)#Video_Umpires. Both
teams and the referees can refer to the video umpire to challenge decision
that can be crucial to the outcome of a game. It's just a matter of time
before this trickles down to national league levels and ultimately AI based
refereeing.

Subject: Re: It's Trivially Easy To Identify You Based On Records Of Your
  Calls and Texts (RISKS-29.53)

It's similar in the UK.  As I understand it, monitoring by security
authorities of the contents of telephone calls and e-mail messages requires
a court order, which at least means that (a) prior permission is needed, and
(b) there's a record that it's been done, but the Government is proposing
that the police/GCHQ/MI5/CIA/FBI/whoever should have full access to all
traffic details (telephone calls made and received, e-mail and SMS messages
sent and received, web sited visited, searches made, etc.) as they wish, as
part of the fight against crime, terror, money-laundering, tax evasion, and
various other nasties of modern life.

Politicians say "there's no violation of privacy, it's not as if they will
be listening in to your calls or reading your e-mails or anything, so no
need to worry", but as noted, just the traffic details reveal everything
(plus the analysis is all done by software, whereas listening to calls and
reading e-mails takes a lot of manual effort, digging through loads of "hi
mom" stuff and suchlike).  Not sure if politicians actually believe this or
they're just trying to sell the idea (with heavy hints that if it doesn't go
ahead we will all be blown up by terrorists, and anybody who objects is
supporting crime).

There's also the question of practicalities; landline telephone calling
details are held for billing purposes anyway, but for Internet and cellphone
traffic, service providers could have to capture and store information which
they don't now, and data volumes will be significant.  Who pays for it all?

Subject: Re: Another Risk of Self-Driving Cars; Clogged Highways?!?
 (RISKS-29.53)

As a regular user of the Waze GPS service, I have found that the best method
of use is to always ask it to present alternative routes and make my own
choice of the preferred route.

The main trouble is that when a main road is blocked, GPS may direct drivers
through side streets -- which would quickly block much worse if hundreds of
cars pour into them, all following the same instructions.  I have once
waited for 20 minutes at a traffic light trying to get back to the main
road, at the end of a detour meant to avoid a 2-minute delay there.

I suspect that self-driving cars, if operated in large numbers, would cause
GPS-generated jams just by all going the same way at the same time.

Subject: Re: The last non-Internet Generation (Drewe, RISKS-29.53)

My Internet connection (over copper) is a pretty solid 17Mb/s. I'm not aware
of any new housing estates near me, but it is rather too common for comfort
for people like me to be living within *a few hundred yards* of people whose
connection is so poor they cannot get broadband.

The reason is that the "distance from the exchange" over the copper wires
often bears no resemblance whatsoever to the actual distance as the crow
flies. It's quite common for the trunk to follow a large circle such that a
new housing estate next to an exchange has its phone connection tagged on to
an estate next door, which was tagged on to the estate next door ... and to
cover a distance of maybe half a mile the trunk has gone on a ten mile
detour.

And "no we can't run a new line direct from the exchange - it's going to be
a nightmare of wayleaves, and digging up roads, and general inconvenience" -
the same argument that is used against running fibre.  If 10% of British
households can't get broadband, they can't *all* be remote, can they?

"Using this in densely populated urban areas is no big deal". So why is this
lack of broadband access a major problem for a lot of people living in large
towns?

Subject: Windows into the Soul new book by Gary T. Marx

I have at last finished the book on surveillance.

The book represents the culmination of decades of thinking about civil
rights, civil liberties and social control and technology questions since
being on the staff of the U.S. Kerner Commission and writing Protest and
Prejudice and Undercover Police Surveillance in America.

The url for the just published Windows Into the Soul: Surveillance and
Society in an Age of High Technology is:
http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo22228665.html

The book reflects my view of social science as best served when it combines
the empirical with the humanistic, the social with the technical, the law
with ethics and honors, but does not give up in, the face of complexity. The
book confronts the haze and is drenched in the ironies, paradoxes,
trade-offs, and value conflicts that so infuse contentious public issues of
great import.

It offers a systematic way to think about being watched and being a
watcher. It goes beyond the usual government and big business suspects to
also address surveillance as it involves families, friends and
strangers. The book is organized around the "4 C's of surveillance"
--contracts, coercion, care and the cross-cutting issue of the private
within the public. It is based on interviews, observation and the social
science literature, but also contains four satirical narratives that seek to
convey the lived experience of being watched and a watcher. These deal with
work monitoring, children, government and a free range voyeur. The book
identifies a number of "techno-fallacies of the information age" and
suggests a series of questions to be asked in assessing the ethics and
wisdom of any effort to collect personal data. Several other chapters on
surveillance in popular culture (music, ads, jokes) had to be cut, but are
available on the webpage the press created for the book.  If you'd like a
copy please let me know and if you had any suggestions for how I might bring
it to the attention of relevant audiences concerned with computers and
society, I'd be most appreciative. Thanks for any suggestions. Best, Gary
