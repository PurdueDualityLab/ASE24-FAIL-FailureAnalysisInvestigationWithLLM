Petition for second EU referendum may have been manipulated

Data shows people from countries including Iceland and Tunisia backed
petition that should only be signed by Britons and UK residents

Nicola Slawson @nicola_slawson, *The Guardian*, 26 Jun 2016

A petition calling for a second EU referendum which has gained more than 3
million signatures appears to have been manipulated.  The request on
parliament's official petitions website should have been signed only by
British citizens and UK residents.  However, the petition's data shows
signatories from countries around the world, including Iceland, the Cayman
Islands and Tunisia, and in some cases there are more signatures than total
population.  [...]

WASHINGTON  Even as U.S. and European regulators jointly pursue ways to fend
off cyberattacks against aviation, they are increasingly focused on devising
standards to ensure that any successful hackers will be detected and
neutralized.

Those twin goals are being widely discussed at an international safety
conference here this week, while new details emerge about proposed
safeguards being developed by a Federal Aviation Administration-created
panel of government and industry officials.

  These workarounds were driven by clinicians' need to get their jobs done
  and by IT's failure to understand what that entailed. For example, IT's
  imposition of password rotation schedules meant that no one knew what
  their passwords were from moment to moment, forcing them to write them
  down and share them (in some cases, IT might have had this policy set by
  vendors or regulators/insurers). Aggressive timeouts on terminals meant
  that clinicians spent an undue amount of time logging in, making it
  impossible to get their work done.  Other IT-based checks forced
  even-more-dangerous workarounds, like the system that wouldn't let doctors
  save work without ordering potentially lethal blood thinners, which they'd
  have to remember to log back in and cancel, or kill their patients.  A
  thumbprint-based signing system for death certificates only accepted
  thumbprints from one doctor, meaning that his signature was on every death
  certificate, regardless of whose patient the deceased had been.

Let's be 100% clear about this lethal situation. It is 100% the fault of the
IT industry for creating systems that are so abysmally suited to the tasks
at hand that healthcare workers need to behave these ways to get their jobs
done and save lives.

Subject: Clinton's private e-mail was blocked byspam filters, so State IT
  turned them off (Sean_Gallagher)

Sean Gallagher, *Ars Technica*, 23 Jun 2016

Documents recently obtained by the conservative advocacy group Judicial
Watch show that in December 2010, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
and her staff were having difficulty communicating with State Department
officials by e-mail because spam filters were blocking their messages. To
fix the problem, State Department IT turned the filters off -- potentially
exposing State's employees to phishing attacks and other malicious e-mails.

The mail problems prompted Clinton Chief of Staff Huma Abedin to suggest to
Clinton, "We should talk about putting you on State e-mail or releasing your
e-mail address to the department so you are not going to spam." Clinton
replied, "Let's get [a] separate address or device but I don't want any risk
of the personal [e-mail] being accessible."

Subject: What are the risks guns could be banned from video games?

Some people have wondered, because of the public shootings that occur every
so often, including the most recent ones in Orlando and Germany, is there a
risk that computer games might be forbidden to show weapons - specifically
guns - or that video games that show guns being used to wound or kill
people, especially in apocalyptic or "collapse of civilization" scenarios,
where players might engage in rampages, including the potential for the
killing of soldiers and police officers, could be banned or prohibited from
distribution?

Short version:

The various governments of the United States -- which means: the federal
government and both a state government and a sub agency of a state
government such as a county or city - lack the power to prohibit a maker of
a video game from including guns in a video game, the use of guns in a video
game, the use of guns on a video game to kill people, or the use of video
games to kill soldiers, uniformed police officers, or even a protected class
of people or an identifiable minority or religious group such as blacks,
Jews, Catholics, Muslims, Protestants, gays, whites, American Indians, men,
women, or children.

<https://it.slashdot.org/story/16/06/25/157247/crypto-ransomware-attacks-have-jumped-500-in-the-last-year>
(Posted by EditorDavid on Saturday June 25, 2016)

Kaspersky Lab is reporting that the last year saw a 500% increase in the
number of users who encountered crypto ransomware. Trailrunner7 shares
an article from On The Wire:
Data compiled by Kaspersky researchers from the company's cloud network
shows that from April 2015 to March 2016, the volume of crypto
ransomware encountered by users leapt from 131,111 to 718,536
<https://www.onthewire.io/crypto-ransomware-attacks-jump-nearly-500/>.
That's a massive increase, especially considering the fact that
ransomware is a somewhat mature threat. It didn't just burst onto the
scene a couple of years ago. Kaspersky's researchers said the spike in
crypto ransomware can be attributed to a small group of variants.
"Looking at the malware groups that were active in the period covered by
this report, it appears that a rather short list of suspects is
responsible for most of the trouble caused by crypto-ransomware..."

It's difficult to overstate how much of an effect the emergence of
ransomware has had on consumers, enterprises, and the security industry
itself. The FBI has been warning users about crypto ransomware for some
time now, and has consistently advised victims not to pay any ransoms.
Security researchers have been publishing decryption tools for specific
ransomware variants and law enforcement agencies have had some success
in taking down ransomware gangs.

Enterprise targets now account for 13% of ransomware attacks, with
attackers typically charging tens of thousands of dollars, the article
reports, and "Recent attacks on networks at the University of Calgary
<https://news.slashdot.org/story/16/06/12/082234/ransomware-thieves-cost-canada-university-c20000-in-bitcoin>

<https://yro.slashdot.org/story/16/06/25/155214/why-you-should-stop-using-telegram-right-now>
(Posted by manishs on Saturday June 25, 201)

Earlier this week, The Intercept evaluated the best instant messaging
clients from the privacy standpoint
<https://it.slashdot.org/story/16/06/22/1934232/battle-of-the-secure-messaging-apps-signal-triumphs-over-whatsapp-allo>.
The list included Facebook's WhatsApp, Google's Allo, and Signal --
three apps that employ end-to-end encryption. One popular name that was
missing from the list was Telegram. A report on Gizmodo sheds further
light on the matter, adding that Telegram is riddled with a wide range
of security issues, and "doesn't live up to its proclamations as a safe
and secure messaging application." Citing many security experts, the
report states
<http://gizmodo.com/why-you-should-stop-using-telegram-right-now-1782557415>:
One major problem Telegram has is that it doesn't encrypt chats by
default, something the FBI has advocated for. "There are many Telegram
users who think they are communicating in an encrypted way, when they're
not because they don't realize that they have to turn on an additional
setting," Christopher Soghoian, Principal Technologist and Senior Policy
Analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, told Gizmodo. "Telegram
has delivered everything that the government wants. Would I prefer that
they used a method of encryption that followed industry best practices
like WhatsApp and Signal? Certainly. But, if it's not turned on by
default, it doesn't matter."

The other issue that security experts have taken a note of is that
Telegram employs its own encryption, which according to them, "is widely
considered to be a fatal flaw when developing encrypted messaging apps."
The report adds:

"They use the MTproto protocol which is effectively homegrown and I've
seen no proper proofs of its security," Alan Woodward, professor at the
University of Surrey told Gizmodo. Woodward criticized Telegram for
their lack of transparency regarding their home cooked encryption
protocol. "At present we don't know enough to know if it's secure or
insecure. That's the trouble with security by obscurity. It's usual for
cryptographers to reveal the algorithms completely, but here we are in
the dark. Unless you have considerable experience, you shouldn't write
your own crypto. No one really understands why they did that."

The list goes on and on.

 your FROM: address, send a message to
   risks-request@csl.sri.com
 containing only the one-word text subscribe or unsubscribe.  You may
 also specify a different receiving address: subscribe address= ... .
 You may short-circuit that process by sending directly to either
   risks-subscribe@csl.sri.com or risks-unsubscribe@csl.sri.com
 depending on which action is to be taken.

 Subscription and unsubscription requests require that you reply to a
 confirmation message sent to the subscribing mail address.  Instructions
 are included in the confirmation message.  Each issue of RISKS that you
 receive contains information on how to post, unsubscribe, etc.
