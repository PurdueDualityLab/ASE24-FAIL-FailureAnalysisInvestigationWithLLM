Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which had come under shelling from

Tyson Slocum, the director of the energy program at the advocacy group

A number of financial institutions in and around New York City are dealing

Subject: Malware attack knocks out software for 6,000+ residential
 properties

I live in a New York City co-op apartment building that contracts with the
firm BuildingLink for a package of administrative & security services, such
as tracking & notification of package deliveries, repair requests,
instructions for the front desk regarding items such as permissions to
enter, and storage and check-out of apartment keys at the front desk. The
system also includes a directory of building residents, including their
apartment numbers, their phone numbers & email addresses. BuildingLink's
software is used in more than 6,000 properties worldwide, according to the
company's website.

The system was down Monday, Tuesday, and much of Wednesday following a
malware attack. Apparently, it was a nationwide outage. Some excerpts from
BuildingLink's status report page (https://status.buildinglink.com/):

12 Sep Monday:

Users are currently unable to access BuildingLink.com and custom domains,
the resident app, and the valet app.

-Users are also unable to access ConciergeLink and the GEO app if not
already logged in....

-KeyLink can currently be used with the fingerprint reader, but not with
username and password.

14 Sep afternoon

On Sunday, 11 Sep, BuildingLink was the target of a malware incident, which
impacted certain network systems.

While we are still in the early stages of an investigation, here's what we
know so far: our team acted quickly and took certain systems offline as a
precautionary measure and continue to take steps to enhance security systems
already in place. We also immediately engaged outside specialists ... to
assist us in our response and conduct a full investigation so we can fully
understand what happened.

15 Sep (this afternoon):

We have a team investigating the malware incident to determine if any data
was impacted. We will share our findings as soon as we are able.

The service interruption had no ill effects on me or anyone I know of. But
I'll be interested to learn what, if any, data concerning those 6,000+
properties and their residents was "impacted."

Subject: Text Messaging Is Cool. But Where Are Its Boundaries? (NYTimes)

Apple and Google have added useful features to texting apps, yet the apps
still lack a major component: an effective way to set limits.

The pros of text messaging can easily turn into cons. Since texting
typically takes only a few seconds and is widely considered the most urgent,
attention-grabbing form of digital communication, itâs difficult to set
boundaries around texting with our colleagues and friends.  Texting invites
us to intrude on other peopleâs time.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/technology/personaltech/texting-ios-android.html

Don't answer? "Do not disturb"? Off?

Plus gripes about various unrelated matters like Apple vs. Google, messaging

Subject: Watch it! Legal issues arise with home security cameras
 (Hiawatha Bray)

*The Boston Globe*, 14 Sep 2022
https://www.boston.com/real-estate/fall-house-hunt/2022/09/14/watch-it-legal-issues-arise-with-home-security-cameras

<https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/ed-markey-slams-amazon-wanda-sykes-ring-nation-1235205556/>

Tech giant Amazon is rolling out a new TV series about Rings, and it's not
their billion-dollar blockbuster set in Middle-Earth.

This show is called Ring Nation, and it will feature videos captured by
Amazon's Ring home security cameras. The idea of a weekly TV series
featuring surveillance videos has ticked off privacy experts, civil
libertarians, and Senator Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. But it
also proves that home security cameras are on the way to becoming as
commonplace as lawn sprinklers.

We've still got a way to go. By the end of 2021, only about 14 percent of
homes with broadband access had a network-connected security camera, while
15 percent owned a video doorbell, according to research firm Parks
Associates.
<https://www.parksassociates.com/blog/article/access-control-ecosystem--expanding-value>

But with the surge in crime
<https://time.com/6138650/violent-crime-us-surging-what-to-do/>, the
percentage is likely to rise. And a 2021 survey by the National Association
of Home Builders indicated that 70 percent of likely home buyers want
security cameras, with 27 percent calling them a âmust-haveâ feature.

When the concept was first patented by Marie van Brittan Brown
<https://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/marie-van-brittan-brown#:~:text=African%20American%20inventor%20Marie%20Van,Jamaica%2C%20Queens%2C%20New%20York.>
and her husband, inventors from Queens, N.Y., back in the 1960s, home-video
technology was far too cumbersome and expensive for the average homeowner.

Today, cameras cost between $100 and $400, depending on the features.  They
can shoot high-resolution video images and carry microphones that can pick
up conversations 20 feet away. Some are completely wireless and powered by
internal batteries or even solar cells, while using Wi-Fi to hook up with a
homeâs broadband system. Videos can be viewed in real time over a smartphone
connection or automatically stored in the Internet cloud for later
viewing. This type of camera --offered by major companies like SimpliSafe,
Vivint, and Ring --is something homeowners can set up easily.

But when people start pointing cameras and microphones at one another,
certain issues arise. Like, what if your next-door neighbor complains that
your camera invades his privacy? What if the microphone records people's
private conversations?

The law has little to say about such matters, according to Matthew Guariglia
<https://www.eff.org/about/staff/dr-matthew-guariglia-0>, a policy analyst
at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online civil liberties group.
``There isn't a lot of protection for people from household surveillance
devices,'' Guariglia said.

If your camera is pointed at a part of your neighbor's property that's in
plain view --like the driveway, front porch, or even the backyard - these
are areas where the neighbor has no reasonable expectation of privacy. And
people are watching. According to a survey Vivint released in May, nearly 25
percent of people with outdoor cameras use them to keep an eye on their
neighbors.

With one major exception: cameras that can see inside someone's home. In a
2014 ruling, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that a homeowner
could be sued for setting up a camera that can peer through the neighbor's
windows.
<https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15557137513272157927&q=Polay+v.+McMahon&hl=en&as_sdt=40000006&as_vis=1>

And be even more careful about recording voices. Under Massachusetts law,
you can't record someone's voice without their permission.  Inadvertently
picking up a few phrases is no big deal, but using your camera to eavesdrop
deliberately could get you into trouble.

Another thing: What happens to all that recorded video and audio? Most of
these systems store it online, where you can review it from any
Internet-connected device. This makes home video systems a godsend for
police forces, which routinely ask homeowners for captured footage of
possible crimes.

Lots of people are fine with this. A 2021 Consumer Reports survey indicated
that 10 percent of video doorbell users have handed over footage to the
police on request.
<https://www.consumerreports.org/consumer-protection/curbs-on-neighbors-by-ring-dont-ease-privacy-rights-concerns-a1459419637/>

Millions of people who own Ring cameras use Amazonâs social network
Neighbors to share video footage with friends -- and with law enforcement.
When a crime is committed, police can log onto Neighbors and request video
footage from all nearby Ring users. Compliance is entirely voluntary, most
of the time.
<https://www.aceableagent.com/blog/amazons-ring-launches-social-network-for-neighborhood-safety/>

But Ring will also provide video recordings without the user's permission if
the police come with a search warrant. In addition, Amazon said that in the
first half of 2022, it handed over Ring videos to police 11 times without a
warrant or user permission. The company said that these were extraordinary
cases involving danger of death such as a kidnapping or an attempted murder.
<https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-gave-police-11-ring-doorbell-videos-without-consent-2021-2022-7>

Even more worrisome is the possibility that hackers could steal your stored
videos or employees at the security company who have no right to see them
will watch them. This actually happened at Ring several years ago, leading
the company to toughen up its access policies.
<https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18177305/ring-employees-unencrypted-customer-video-amazon>

If the prospect dismays you, Ring offers the option to encrypt all your
videos automatically so that only you can unlock them. Or you can opt for a
security camera that allows you to store all video on a small hard drive,
instead of keeping it online.

Of course, a local drive could be lost or damaged or a savvy thief could
cover his tracks by stealing it, which just goes to show that there's no
such thing as perfect security.

The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday upheld a controversial Texas
social media law that bars companies from removing posts based on a person’s

The ruling could have wide-ranging effects on the future of tech regulation,

Subject: We're stuck with this white elephant: A Wisconsin town's big bet
 on electronics maker Foxconn hasn't panned out as planned (Fortune)

In 2017, Terry Gou, then CEO of electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn,
announced in the White House's East Room that his firm would spend $10
billion to build a state-of-the-art megafactory in Wisconsin that would make
LCD television and computer screens. "We are committed to creating great
jobs for American people," Gou said at the press conference, promising
13,000 new jobs for Wisconsinites.

The announcement spawned the Wisconn Valley Science and Technology Park and
the aspiration that the cornfields of southeastern Wisconsin could become a
global tech hub with the help of Foxconn, best known for producing iPhones
for Apple. "We believe this will have a transformational effect on
Wisconsin, just as Silicon Valley transformed the San Francisco Bay Area,"
Wisconsin’s then-Gov. Scott Walker declared at the press conference,
alongside then-President Donald Trump and top Wisconsin lawmakers.

Now five years into the experiment, so-called Wisconn Valley has failed to
live up to expectations. Instead of a sprawling 20-million-square-foot
factory complex, Foxconn has built a far smaller campus. There is a
1-million-square-foot warehouse, a 260,000-square-foot "smart manufacturing
center," a 120,000-square-foot "multipurpose building," and a 100-foot-tall
glass globe that bulges from otherwise empty farmland like an otherworldly
"orb," says Gordon Hintz, a member of Wisconsin’s state assembly.

Nobody is quite sure what the buildings are being used for, though it’s
clearly not manufacturing. "The whole thing has just been a joke," says
Hintz.

But the town of Mount Pleasant, home to the project, isn't laughing. [...]

To pay upfront for the Foxconn site and infrastructure such as water pipes
and road upgrades, Mount Pleasant created a special district, called a tax
increment financing, or TIF, district. It allowed the town to borrow $911
million on an annual budget of $23 million. "Let's say you have an income of
$50,000," says Lawrence Tabak, author of Foxconned, a book about Foxconn's
Wisconsin factory. "That would be like buying a $10 million house and then
trying to figure out how you're going to pay the taxes and mortgage debt."

Subject: Re: How criminals are using jammers, deauthers to disrupt WiFi

I see *two* problems:

1. WiFi CCTV cameras should always record locally (encrypted with PKE), even
when WiFi isn't working. A 256GB SD card now costs $21 at Amazon. You may
not get a real-time warning, but at least you'll still have the video
(assuming you have the decryption key).

2. WiFi operates in Part 15 unlicensed spectrum.  FCC says "Part 15 devices
may not cause any harmful interference to authorized services and must
***accept any interference*** that may be received"

It is well-known that *spread spectrum* techniques can resist jamming
(intentional or otherwise).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_spectrum

"Resistance to jamming (interference). Direct sequence (DS) is good at
resisting continuous-time narrowband jamming, while frequency hopping (FH)
is better at resisting pulse jamming."

Spread spectrum techniques utilize so-called "process gain" (measured in dB)
to overcome jamming interference.  Since WiFi transmitters are limited in
the amount of power they can utilize in overcoming jammers, they could in
theory utilize more "process gain" get their signal through. However, these
techniques would dramatically reduce the transfer speed in Mbps, but at
least the signal would get through.

The good news is that ***ultra wide band*** (UWB) is coming to devices
near you.

https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1021131

"UWB offers low probability of detection (LPD), low probability of =
interception
(LPI) as well as anti-jamming (AJ) properties in signal space"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-wideband

"Ultra-wideband characteristics are well-suited to short-range applications,
such as PC peripherals, wireless monitors, ***camcorders***, wireless
printing, and file transfers to portable media players. UWB was proposed for
use in personal area networks, and appeared in the IEEE 802.15.3a draft PAN
standard. However, after several years of deadlock, the IEEE 802.15.3a task
group was dissolved in 2006. The work was completed by the WiMedia Alliance
and the USB Implementer Forum. Slow progress in UWB standards development,
the cost of initial implementation, and performance significantly lower =
than initially expected are several reasons for the limited use of UWB in =
consumer products (which caused several UWB vendors to cease operations in
2008 and 2009)."

It appears that Rob Slade <rslade@gmail.com> said: >In its new line of
iPhones, Apple will be doing away with physical SIM >cards, moving instead
to a system it refers to as eSIM.  This will be a >software version of
identification of the phone handset, and will be >modifiable in order to

Samsung introduced an eSIM watch in 2015, and since 2019 eSIM phones have
been available from Samsung, Motorola, Sony, Google, Huawei and others. The
change in the iPhone 14 is that in North America it will ship without a
physical SIM slot, just eSIM. Models sold in some countries will continue to
have both, in China just physical SIMs.

I don't see any new threat here other than that if you have an account with
a North American carrier that doesn't offer eSIM, you lose. But in practice
other than some small MVNOs they all do. For people who travel and use
different SIMs in different countries, eSIMs are a pain to swap, but that's
not new either.

I would also have expected to hear of eSIM security attacks but so far I
haven't. Maybe there are easier was to attack a phone, like SIM swapping.

I just had a similar experience with Microsoft's help team for Outlook.  I
usually read my mail on Outlook's site, using Firefox.  There's a bug which
sometimes makes messages disappear from the Inbox.  I reported it to
Microsoft's help team and had a nice chat.

When they heard that this problem does not happen on Chrome (or maybe I just
don't use it often enough to encounter the bug), their reaction was
something like "Oh, then it's a browser problem, Bye!"

My comment that such a major application should work well on all major
browsers, was simply ignored.

Regarding the practice of websites mandating Chrome: Yes, it's bad, but in a
practical sense that's the world many of us are already living in. How often
have you complained about some web site feature that isn't working for you
in (e.g.) Firefox, only to be told by support that that's the way it is and
you need to use Chrome to avoid the problem?

 Whistle-Blower (RISKS-33.44)

Ronan Farrow is a good reporter, but this time, quite unusually, he totally
blew it.

The people looking for info about Mudge are not Musk and his allies looking
to discredit him. They are investment bankers and hedge funds using the
expert networks they've been using for decades to figure out what their TWTR
stock is worth. They only care whether Mudge is credible to see if he's
going to have an effect on the outcome of the trial in Delaware. If Twitter
wins, their stock is worth about $50, and if Musk wins, more like
$20. (Informed observers say he won't.)  The companies that connect
investors with experts they pay for business info are nothing new or
unusual, nor should it be surprising that the people asking about Mudge are
doing so.

Matt Levine noted this in his Bloomberg newsletter yesterday, as did Andrew
Ross Sorkin in his NY Times Dealbook column today. The latter offered a link
to an old story from 2001 about how the expert networks work:

https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/23/business/investing-it-s-not-what-they-know-but-whom.html

They call me every few months, generally with a client who wants to
understand Verisign's relationship with ICANN and USDoC.

Subject: Re: Facebook has no idea where to find your data (RISKS-33.44)

Failure to document programs/routines is commonplace in the IT sector, and
it is unarguably nice to have documentation of how programs/routines work
and where their outputs are stored.  But the fact is that programs get
modified over time and the documentation doesn't always keep pace.  In many
cases the doc wasn't accurate to begin with.

So there is something to be said for "self-documenting" code, if one is
skilled enough to be able to read it.

Subject: Re: 3D gun printing operation busted in Calgary (RISKS-33.44)

I've seen it a number of times, on 3D printing sites and "gun nut" sites,
that it costs $2-3 in filament to print a pistol frame/receiver good for a
thousand-ish shots. But that is it: *filament* for *pistol frame*. No wear
and tear on the printer, no electricity bill, no barrel, pin, springs, nor
any other parts that make a working pistol, included.  (Some rifle receivers
apparently can be printed too, but require better quality filament and more
of it.) Nor the program cost: some a free, many are not.

I lived in Australia during its much hyped gun buy-back and saw pictures of
heaps of rust for which the government had to pay, by law, a "fair market
price of a weapon". So I don't really doubt that Houston "buy back program
gone LOL/wrong" in many cases.

But I do very much doubt the "$3 gun".
