Subject: Map Reveals Distrust in Health Expertise Is Winning Hearts, Minds
  Online (GW Today, RISKS-31.86)

Authority argues from conclusions. These "anti-vaxers" people inherently
distrust Authority for both good and bad reasons.

Two years ago, when I had some unrelated medical tests done during flu
season, many staff were wearing surgical masks because it was policy that
those who chose not to vaccinate had to wear masks.  These were
knowledgeable medical professionals, some vaccinating others.  If those who
know the product decline to use it, it's the product's fault, not just the
rumors!

The solution is not to argue from conclusions and map strategies based on
Authority and Community; but to Improve the Product so one can argue from
Facts and Science as they apply to the very person you are trying to
convince and vaccinate. If argument is even needed!  As master advertising
man Ogilvy wrote decades ago, a good product sells itself, a bad product
kills itself; good advertising can only speed that process either way.

As for me, I am allergic to chickens and eggs, so most vaccinations can be
problematic.  I had not had a flu for over ten years, but this year, I had
two flu's.  Having been a patient of the late Dr. Robert F.  Cathcart, my
standard is to try to overdose on Vitamin C [*] when I have a cold or
flu. For me, that's ten grams (two heaping teaspoons) of pure ascorbic acid
in water every half hour. With that, my flu's are almost always gone in 4 to
8 hours, by which time I will feel the rumbling side effects of overdose,
indicating the immune system has run out of target and wants to flush the
excess C. (But even if I miss the early rumblings and overdose, sitting on
the throne for an hour or two is still Way better than the flu!)
http://mall-net.com/cathcart/titrate.html

Why are the doctors not pushing C?  Low profit, so no liability support from
the vitamin companies, the way Big Pharma does with high cost drugs where
the expected settlements are factored into the price.

It was easier when I could get a 60-gram vitamin C IV, when Doc's office was
open.  Vitamin C is one of the most potent anti-virals one can get.  When
the immune system ramps up to fight any invasion, the body needs many times
the normal amount as C is used by the white blood cells to generate the
immune system's ammunition.

What we need is not simply to study the failure of the body in disease; but
to expand the research to look at why some people just don't get this or
that disease!

Measles is Highly Contagious.  Years Before the vaccine came out, I played
with my cousin all day, the day before he broke out with measles.  I never
got it.  Our doctor commented that some people just don't get some diseases.
Why didn't I?  I got a lot of other childhood disease.  Is it nutrition,
genetics, or could it be a few minimal exposures primed the immune system
before the big exposure? (When I had the chicken pox, our family doctor
brought his son along to give him some exposure.)

As Engineers and Scientists, we need to study the body's successes, not just
its failures, that we can build on success, not merely butress failure.

 [I have known javilk for close to 40 years.  He has long had challenging
 allergies and sensitivities.  Dr. Cathcart did also, and was an early
 orthomolecular doctor whom we both visited at the same time.  Dr.C took
 about 40 grams of Vitamin C daily, which enabled him to function as a
 remarkably holistic doctor.  Both of them are proof that one size does not
 fit all when it comes to diagnoesis and remediation.  Neither
 pharmaceuticals nor vaccinations should be considered as the ultimate
 corrective actions, much less panaceas.  The current pandemic must serve as
 a teaching moment that the existing teaching is inadequate, and that what
 we are learning is also inadequate.  We really need to fundamentally change
 the way we live globally, with a holistic perspective that encompasses a
 very wide range of contributing factors -- including (for example) planning
 for future pandemics, long-term implications of extreme climate changes,
 survival of the planet and civilization, sustainable agriculture and food
 distribution, clean energy, water, and air, available health care, and much
 more.  As we have noted here before, almost everything is interrelated, in
 ways that are often not generally recognized.  PGN]

``A return to balance would be commercially unviable. The best solution may
be an honest embrace of bias.'' [...]

https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-liberal-leaning-media-has-passed-its-tipping-point-11590430876?shareToken=st56e4a511a98947c0a19d21ffcd2f3fdc

  [Return to balance?  When was that?
  The WSJ paywall discouraged me from reading this item (while recognizing
  that is what newspapers have to do to survive), but the concept expressed
  in the URL is certainly intriguing!  To some, ``Call a spade a spade''
  might in the past have implied that the spade was good only for digging up
  dirt on those who disagree with you, rather than for planting new seeds
  and trees, and digging graves for the sadly fallen.  However, there is a
  huge difference between fake news and ``Fake News!!'', when what is really
  most important is *truth*.  If one unfortunately considers truth to be
  equivalent to bias, then that is part of the problem.  On the other hand,
  if telling the truth irrespective of one's belief systems is not
  commercially viable, then we really are in need of some massive
  rethinking.  On the *other* other hand, the ACM Risks Forum is not
  commercially viable either, and yet it keeps on going (with your help).
  Thanks to all you contributors, even if you may occasionally take some
  criticism here for expressing what you believe.  We believe in truth, with
  reasonable discussions whenever there are disagreements.  PGN]

Subject: Parts of the Arctic are hotter than Washington, with temperatures
  nearly 40 degrees above average (WashPost)

Snow cover is disappearing, sea ice is melting and fires, including
possible `zombie' blazes, are raging.

Siberia is in the throes of a heat wave that would be considered warm even
by the standards of those living outside the Arctic Circle.

In Washington, for example, the temperature has been stuck in the 60s all
week, reaching a maximum of 73 degrees Thursday. Yet several stations in
North Central Siberia, including areas near or above the Arctic Circle, are
seeing temperatures climb well into the 80s.

On Friday, the town of Khatanga, Siberia, located well north of the Arctic
Circle, recorded a temperature of 78 degrees, some 46 degrees above
normal. The typical maximum temperature for the day at that location is 32
degrees. The town obliterated its previous record high for the date of 54 by
some 24 degrees and its monthly record of 68 by about 10 degrees.

The Siberian warmth in May is not a fluke event, either; instead, it's been
a consistent feature since the winter. Temperature departures from average
in Europe and Asia have helped push global average surface temperatures to
record highs this year, and on global temperature maps, these regions stand
out as splotches of crimson red. [...]

Subject: Re: Misinformation (Ladkin, RISKS-31.87)

With all due respect to esteemed Dr. Ladkin, I would politely suggest
that he direct his future "misinformation" complaints to the
- editors of The Guardian back in 2005,
- World Health Organization's statisticians,
- Bill Bostock of the Business Insider,
- and of course Ms. Sue Denim whose code review was a starting point of
  this thread. That last one was the only one I did not link to in my post,
  as that link was already there upthread.

How long will it be before we see: "iPhone app bug allows anyone to lock
Tesla owners into their cars"?
