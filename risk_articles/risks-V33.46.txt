Subject: Multiple driverless Cruise cars block traffic in San Francisco
 (SanFranChron)

At least three driverless Cruise cars were responsible for holding up
traffic and reportedly blocking a bus lane in San Francisco last week, the
latest in a string of incidents involving the locally headquartered
self-driving car company.

A video shared on Reddit showed two of Cruise's vehicles at a standstill
Thursday evening, near the intersection of Sacramento and Leavenworth
streets, with their hazard lights flashing. A Muni bus appeared to be
stalled about a block behind them.

``Come on, we've got to get the f*** going,'' one person could be heard
yelling in the background of the video.  ``There's no driver!'' another
responded.

Subject: Egypt's submarine cable stranglehold (Sebastian Moss)

Sebastian Moss, Datacenter Dynamics, 15 Sep 2022
Understanding the Middle East bottleneck, and how things could be set to
change
https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/egypts-submarine-cable-stranglehold/

The world's digital infrastructure has been built by the paranoid. At every
turn, equipment is duplicated, routes are triplicated, fuel reserves are
over-filled. Astronomical sums are spent on building layers and layers of
safety into the system, as suspicious minds game out various scenarios that
could put the precious flow of data at risk.  And yet, there remains one
giant bottleneck, a quirk of geography and geopolitics, that is anything but
redundant.

If you take a map of the world's submarine cable infrastructure, responsible
for shuttling data between nations and entire continents, and zoom in on the
Middle East, you will notice something striking: Everything goes through
Egypt.

Data traveling to and from Europe and Asia, as well as Northern Africa and
the Middle East itself, has just one route.

Coming from the Gulf of Aden, cables snake up along the Red Sea, and into
the Gulf of Suez. There, they make landfall in Egypt, traversing little more
than a hundred miles, before breaking out into the Mediterranean Sea.

"There's no way a network operator would design their network like this
under ideal conditions, right?" said Paul Brodsky, senior analyst at
Telegeography, best known for its maps of cable routes. "They don't like
having everything funneled through one place."

This route concentration is a concern for reliability, putting an estimated
17 percent of the world's Internet traffic in the hands of one country, and
in one shallow and narrow sea. But it is also a concern for businesses,
which have to contend with a monopoly.

To get through Egypt, companies have to pay exorbitant fees to state-owned
Telecom Egypt. Prices have risen dramatically, amid claims of corruption,
but operators have had little choice but to pay. At least until now.

The only route

The story of Egypt's submarine stranglehold is hard to tell. Several
analysts declined to talk on the record due to business relationships with
Telecom Egypt. Cable providers either declined to talk, or did not respond
to requests for comment.  ``I am afraid I won't be open to discuss the
Egyptian submarine cable bottleneck due to certain concerns,'' another
industry figure said, declining to elaborate.

In Egypt itself, it's even harder to talk about the cable situation.  In
2019, the TV host of local news program 90 minutes, Ossama Kamal, accused
the government of corruption with the way it charges submarine cable
operators, and said it risked destroying its position as the gateway between
Asia and Europe.

Immediately following the broadcast, he was suspended from his show, fined,
and forced to apologize. He did not respond to requests for comment.

Whether Telecom Egypt abuses its market dominance is a matter of debate --
some, speaking on background, called fees extortionate.  Others accepted it
as the cost of business for using the most logical route through the Middle
East, with more than a dozen major cables choosing to go across the country.

Egypt's position as a critical communications node between East and West
dates all the way back to the colonial era, and remains, due to a few simple
reasons.

First is geography: It's the shortest stretch of land between the
Mediterranean and Arabian seas, hence the creation of the Suez Canal for
shipping. Network operators like to avoid needlessly traveling across land,
with its expensive owners and pesky national sovereignties that need to be
dealt with.

Then comes geopolitics. Do Western companies want data to travel through
Iran? How about Iraq, Afghanistan, or Syria? Operators like to steer clear
of sanctioned nations, or active war zones, so they are off most people's
preferred routes -- although some have still tried, but we'll get to that
later. There is one other journey they could take, but that too, we shall
save.

Finally, there are market forces. "Once you establish a route and
everybody's using it, the cost goes down as more people use it," Doug
Madory, director of Internet analysis at Kentik, explained. "So it's really
hard not to use it, and it's hard to break out of what ends up being the
most selected path.

``With this Egypt chokepoint, obviously the geographic layout is the number
one reason, but then once it gets established, it's super hard to break out
because then there's so many cables, so many lines, so much infrastructure
built along that path.''

With this in its favor, Telecom Egypt has been able to charge huge fees --
between 6.6 percent and 17.4 percent of its total revenues came from cable
fees between 2008 to 2019, according to Submarine Cable Networks. The
founder of SCN declined to comment.

It took a while for the state telco to realize it was sitting on a goldmine:
It used to sell a perpetual license for somewhere in the ballpark of
$100k. Then they moved to a monthly fee, a source told DCD. "Then they said
'oh no, we want to have the transit costs, where people pay by volume of
traffic."  So if tomorrow traffic doubles for a telecom, they get double pay
or whatever the tiering system is," Madory said. "I feel like that was too
far -- people started to revolt, although what can you do? It's not like
there's another Egypt you can go to."

Another industry figure called the fees "ridiculous." An SCN report found
that 12 submarine cables crossing Egypt paid the telco at least $369 million
for Indefeasible Right of Use, with additional Operation and Maintenance
(O&M) charges during the lifetime - however, it is not clear if this is
before the telco tried to shift to charging more for more traffic.

Subject: Morgan Stanley Smith Barney to Pay $35 Million for Extensive
 Failures to Safeguard Personal Information of Millions of Customers (SEC)

https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-168

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (MSSB) stemming from the firm's extensive
failures, over a five-year period, to protect the personal identifying
information, or PII, of approximately 15 million customers. MSSB has agreed
to pay a $35 million penalty to settle the SEC charges.

The SEC' order finds that, as far back as 2015, MSSB failed too properly
dispose of devices containing its customers' PII. On multiple occasions,
MSSB hired a moving and storage company with no experience or expertise in
data destruction services to decommission thousands of hard drives and
servers containing the PII of millions of its customers. Moreover, according
to the SEC's order, over several years, MSSB failed to properly monitor the
moving company's work. The staff's investigation found that the moving
company sold to a third party thousands of MSSB devices including servers
and hard drives, some of which contained customer PII, and which were
eventually resold on an Internet auction site without removal of such
customer PII. While MSSB recovered some of the devices, which were shown to
contain thousands of pieces of unencrypted customer data, the firm has not
recovered the vast majority of the devices.

Suffolk County Asks NYPD for Help After Hack Cripples 911 Call Center and
Police HQ

Ten days after a cyber attack hit Suffolk County computers, much of the
county's police department is still deeply feeling the effects -- and is
calling on the NYPD for backup.

The 911 dispatch center at the Suffolk County Police Department headquarters
has been reduced to using pen and paper, after hackers took down the county
government's computers.

"Unfortunately had to go back to our old system where information is
recorded by hand and information is handed to the dispatcher, in contrast to
putting it into a computer-aided system," said Suffolk County Police
Commissioner Rodney Harrison.  [...]  And it's not just police hurting as a
result. Title searches, an essential part of real estate closings, have been
frozen too. Lawyers and buyers are trying to proceed with caution.

Subject: 15-Year-Old Python Bug Allows Code Execution in 350k Projects
 (Ionut Ilascu)

Ionut Ilascu, BleepingComputer*, 21 Sep 2022 via ACM Tech News 23 Sep 2022

An unpatched 15-year-old bug in the Python programming language could affect
more than 350,000 open-source repositories, and could lead to code
execution. The path traversal vulnerability, disclosed in 2007, resides in
the Python tarfile package, and can allow hackers to overwrite arbitrary
files. The flaw exists because the code in the extract function in Python's
tarfile module trusts data in the TarInfo object "and joins the path that is
passed to the extract function and the name in the TarInfo object." Analyst
Charles McFarland at extended detection and response solutions provider
Trellix rediscovered the bug while probing another security issue. No
reports indicate the bug has been exploited in attacks, although it remains
a threat in the software supply chain.

GitHub has completed the construction of its Arctic Code Vault, a
21-terabyte snapshot of all public software repositories mainly encoded in
quick response codes and located 250 meters (820 feet) within a mountain in
Svalbard, Norway. The GitHub Archive Program's Jon Evans said, "Our hope is
that by storing and indexing millions of repositories, we have captured a
valuable cross-section of the world of modern software." The archive is
designed to last a millennium, with the snapshot stored on more than 180
film reels. A nearly 1.5-ton steel box contains the archive, and is
decorated with artificial intelligence-generated etchings to entice future
generations. Evans said the vault could potentially help someone who may
need software that is otherwise lost, and also will serve as a historical
record.
