Subject: The `Dumb Money' Outfoxing Wall Street Titans (NYTimes)

Driven by Social Media, Amateurs Rush In to Squeeze Top Funds
Matt Phillips and Taylor Lorenz,
*The New York Times*, 28 Jan 2021, front page

  For example, GameStop share prices went from under $40 to $347,51 in less
  than a week.  GameStop had been shorted by professionals, and boosted by
  some cleverness by "millions of amateur traders collectively taking on
  some of Wall Street's most sophisticated investors."  [PGN-ed]

  This is a remarkable David-and-Goliath tale, with a lot of Alices and Bobs
  participating as well.  Or might it be the tale wagging the dog?  PGN

Subject: The Creeping Normalization of Robotic Police Officers
  (Digital Trends)

Robotic police officers are slowly being normalized, whether we like it
or not

“I worry about when we move out of the stage where police robots are just
photo opportunities. We're going to eventually have to confront the scenario
in which robots that police have to make decisions, and when the time comes
that a police robot makes the wrong decision — somebody gets hurt or the
wrong person gets arrested — police robots are not people,” Guariglia
says. “You can't reprimand them.”

What if the robot falsely identifies them as a criminal and gets them
arrested? Who will be held responsible for that? You can't fire a robot or
charge it with a crime.

Guariglia also notes that these robots can easily be outfitted with all
kinds of surveillance technology, and they could become “roving surveillance
towers.” He says a robot might be assigned to a high-crime neighborhood to
conduct near-constant surveillance and call the police when it suspects it's
identified a criminal, whether it has or not.

Imagine you're walking down the street and a police robot orders you to
stop. It believes you're wanted for a crime and calls the police on you.
The police arrive and take you to jail. You're released once they figure out
that they've arrested the wrong person. They blame the robot's algorithm,
and there's nothing you can do about it. It's a dystopian future we could be
fast approaching.

Not a word about whether any of these are autonomous or manually controlled.
Just a bit overwrought.

Subject: Bank error not in my favour

I am volunteering, under the auspices of a well-known organization, at the
vaccination centres being set up in England. While I don't get paid for
this, I am allowed to claim mileage because it's a 75 mile round trip at
present and about to become 130 miles when I change centres.

After some minor teething troubles, I have finally got access to the web
site used for making claims and start my first claim. In the UK, all bank
accounts have an 8 digit number and a 6 digit "sort code", usually written
in the form "12-34-56". The form asks me to enter both of these, in
different boxes. The latter says "enter sort code as 6 digits, either with
or without dashed".

The web site is dynamic so that valid answers have a green background and
invalid (or not-yet-filled-in) ones have a pink background. The account
number was accepted but the sort code was rejected. I try taking out the
dashes in case the instructions were wrong but, no, that doesn't help. I
wonder if they're using a validation database so try the sort code of a
different account at a different bank. No, doesn't help. I dig through my
memory and come up with the sort code from an account I had held for 30
years but eventually closed. No, that doesn't work either. I even try
logging out, logging in again, and starting over. No dice.

Eventually I get annoyed enough that I type "123456" in the box. Green!
"111111"? Pink for the first five digits, then green on the sixth.
"999999", the same. "000000", stays pink. Hmm. "012345": stays pink.
"111110": pink. "111112": green.

Yes, it doesn't accept "0" as a digit (it doesn't accept "O" either; I
tried). And all three of my accounts had at least one zero in their sort
code (the first one has two, including a leading zero).

My calculator says this should be rejecting 47% of possible sort codes and a
higher proportion of issued ones, including all those used by at least three
major banks and also the codes allocated to the Bank of England!

Subject: Sidewalk, security, and PopulistNet

I've been seeing mentions of Amazon Sidewalk, and how it is going to destroy
security and privacy as we know it.  There was some mention of it on the
"community."  But it is, of course, the RISKS Forum Digest that finally got
me to read up and figure out what it is all about.

Lo and behold, Sidewalk is my old friend PeopleNet, or PopulistNet.
https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1390 Well, a sort of
cut-down version of it, and limited to Amazon devices (and therefore
completely owned by Amazon, which sort of defeats the original purpose).
But, I suppose it is a start.

(By the way, if Amazon has patented any of this, my article was published in
2010, so it could probably invalidate some of the patents by being prior art.)

Amazon has attempted to head off some of the undoubted complaints about
security and privacy by detailing some provisions of security for the
Sidewalk network, and publishing those in a white paper.  https://m.media-
amazon.com/images/G/01/sidewalk/final_privacy_security_whitepaper.pdf
Stripped to it's essentials, it's basically a version of Tor.  There are
"layers" of encryption, corresponding the the OSI application and network
layers (and one more "just for show," as Tevye would put it).  There is also
a promise to limit bandwidth (which probably has as much to do with
preventing usage-based denial of service as anything else).

In regard to encryption, key exchange is vital.  Sidewalk relies upon
Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman.  A decent protocol, to be sure, but
what kind of key size are we talking about?  Then there is the blythe
promise of "random" key generation.  (We know that "random" is not possible,
and there is no detail on how any pseudorandom data is generated.)  (There
is a good deal of digital certification going on, and there is a kind of
certificate revocation list, which is comforting.  At least they seem to
have covered the basics.)

Amazon's use of encryption is supposed to protect privacy, but the wording
that the Sidewalk Network Server makes it "difficult" to de-anonymize data
implicitly admits that it isn't impossible.  It will be interesting to see,
with the aggregation of undoubtedly huge amounts of data, how difficult or
easy this might be.

When I first proposed PopulistNet, I knew that securing such communications
would be a non-trivial task.  I still hope for some kind of open-source
exploration of the idea on a much wider scale than Amazon.  Sidewalk does
provide some ideas for the securing of such a system.

This is a prevalent but misleading description of the Audi 100/5000 issue. 
(Not picking on John Levine here. You can find such a summary description
almost anywhere. But RISKS readers deserve to know the whole story.)

In reality, there was a vehicle defect that initiated the event, and human
drivers got blamed for imperfect reactions to a surprise wide-open-throttle
situation in a parking lot.

The original source is: Study of mechanical and driver-related systems of
the Audi 5000 capable of producing uncontrolled sudden acceleration
incidents, DOT-TSC-NHTSA-88-4, Dec. 1988, Appendix H.
https://archive.org/details/Audi5000UAReport

Abstract:  "Some versions of Audi idle-stabilization system were prone to
defects which resulted in excessive idle speeds and brief unanticipated
accelerations of up to 0.3g.  These accelerations could not be the sole
cause of SAIs, but might have triggered some SAIs by startling the
driver."   ("SAI" = Sudden Acceleration Incident)

Pages 1-6 to 1-7: "The Audi 5000 has mechanical and electronic failure modes
that could induce engine surging and produce unexpected increases in engine
power." ... "Failures in the idle-stabilizer system, and to a much lesser
extent the cruise control system, were identified which are capable of
initiating an SAI without leaving evidence detectable under normal test
procedures." ... "It can therefore be concluded that once unwanted
acceleration has begun, pedal misapplication resulting from panic,
confusion, or perhaps unfamiliarity with the Audi 5000 contributes to the
severity of the incident."

The data I've seen puts 0.3g as on a par with 0-60 maximum acceleration
numbers for that vehicle.  Contrast the abstract "triggered" with the text
"contributes to the severity".

As far as I can tell, this report is the genesis of the pedal misapplication
narrative commonly at play in cases such as the recent Tesla outcome. 
(There is a 1989 follow-on report that elaborates that narrative:
DOT-HS-807-367.)

For those who want to dig deeper, a SAFECOMP 2018 paper covers the history
of this RISK-y narrative of blaming the driver by default while, in many
cases, failing to rule in a sufficient scope of potential computer-based
system defects.  (For example, perhaps the accelerator pedal is read
incorrectly due to defective software. That same incorrect data commands
engine power, and is also sent to the data recorder.  But this is just a
hypothetical; I've not looked at the Tesla situation.)
