Subject: How Russia Recruited Elite Hackers for Its Cyberwar

http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/world/europe/how-russia-recruited-elite-hackers-for-its-cyberwar.html

The government scouted a wide range of civilian programmers in recent years,
even criminals, while expanding its cyberwarfare abilities.

While much about Russia's cyberwarfare program is shrouded in secrecy,
details of the government's effort to recruit programmers in recent years --
whether professionals like Mr. Vyarya, college students, or even criminals
-- are shedding some light on the Kremlin's plan to create elite teams of
computer hackers.

Subject: Obama Strikes Back at Russia for Election Hacking

http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/us/politics/russia-election-hacking-sanctions.html

The Obama administration said it was tossing out 35 intelligence operatives
and imposing sanctions on Russian intelligence services and officers.

  [Editorial comment:
     We must always remember that the allegedly secure systems on which we
     must depend are nowhere near secure enough.  Furthermore, security is
     often compromised by simple social engineering and other low-hanging
     bad fruit, irrespective of the technology.  Nevertheless, nation-state
     hacking into other nations' systems is reprehensible.  However, it is
     very likely to happen -- especially as long as one's system and network
     security is so weak, and one's overall national computer literacy is so
     inadequate.  PGN]

  "Honestly, the long tail is to advertising what subprime was to
  mortgages," he said. "No one knows what's in it, but it helps people
  believe that there is a mysterious tonnage of impressions that are really
  low cost. But low-cost impressions would mean low-cost human
  attention. How can any publisher of quality content survive on low-cost
  impressions?"  Marc Goldberg, chief executive of Trust Metrics, an ad
  safety vendor, said the effort to remove bad actors ignored the fact that
  many advertisers value impressions over everything else.  They would
  rather not choose and monitor what websites they are appearing on, he
  said, because they worry they will miss out on potentially lucrative
  destinations.  "What they're doing is introducing all of these bad sites
  into our ecosystem and not having the means to monitor them appropriately
  and effectively," he said. "The big problem in our industry is our
  expectations of scale are not aligned with reality."

What are the risks of robots in the White House?  If a robot can drive, why
not a robot that tweets at 3am?

The White House could use more automation, but could a robot deal with the
lack of a "W" key?

Also, does a robot requires Senate confirmation?

Subject: German Fake News debate: "False Opinion" destabilizes

There is an amusing (or, alternatively, chilling) tidbit on the German "fake
news" debate.

Michael Grosse-Brömer is Parliamentary Chairman of the CDU, the party of
Chancellor Merkel. He made a short video teaser for a TV broadcast on ZDF,
the public-service TV broadcaster, about "fake news".  In this, he said (my
translation)

"We have to take notice, supported by findings of journalists, scientists
and intelligence agencies, that there are a lot of people on the Net who
want to destabilize, who spread false opinion, who want to
manipulate. Politics has to deal with this, especially before election
campaigns."

Yes, he said "spread false opinion" ("falsche Meinung verbreiten" in the
original German).

Viewer comments ranged from "Finally, a politician who speaks the truth" to
"Freudian slip, he said what he thinks, not what he wanted to say".

Interestingly enough, the ZDF pulled the video and resulting viewer comments
without comment or explanation.

Grosse-Brömer later stated on Twitter that he meant to say "spread false
reports" ("Falsche Meldungen verbreiten").

In view of the efforts create a "Ministry of Truth" within the German
government (see RISKS-30.05), this is rather chilling.

Here is the video, including the original sound track:

And here some more analysis of his texts, in German:

Subject: Re: SHAME ON YOU, GOOGLE!

In addition to fearing the results if governments try to label truth and
falsehood, I certainly see little likelihood of that happening at least in
the USA. In any grocery store checkout line there will be tabloid
"newspapers" which present as truth all sorts of falsehoods. I see people
reading them while waiting to check out, and occasionally buying them. When
some celebrity thinks he/she has been damaged by an article, photograph,
etc., and sues, these papers have consistently used the defense that
"everybody knows we are just publishing material we created, for
entertainment, with no claim to fact". (But I think many readers never heard
that defense and subscribe to the "If it is in print it must be true"
position.) These seem to me to be quite like the false news sites, but the
US government has so far as I know never made any attempt to control them,
and I suspect it would be thrown out on 1st Amendment grounds if it were
tried.

This does not mean I really want this attack on our national belief system
to continue without legal action of some sort. But the only action I can
imagine having a significant effect has no chance of happening, somehow
educating and motivating our population to think.

Subject: Scholarships for Women Studying Information Security

Since 2011, Applied Computer Security Associates, sponsor of the ACSAC,
NSPW, LAW, and LASER conferences, has offered scholarships for women in
security-related undergraduate and masters' degree programs through the
Scholarships for Women Studying Information Security (SWSIS, www.swsis.org).

Thanks to a $250,000 4-year contribution by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)
in early 2014, ACSA expanded our program to award 11 scholarships for the
2014-15 academic year, 16 for the 2015-16 academic year, and 16 for the
2016-17 academic year. The Committee on the Status of Women in Computing
Research (CRA-W), an arm of the Computing Research Alliance, led selection
of scholarship winners.  Information about the 49 SWSIS Scholars
(scholarship winners) is available at www.swsis.org.

ACSA, CRA-W, and HPE are pleased to announce that applications for
2017-18 scholarships are accepted Dec 15 2016 - Feb 1 2017.

To apply, an applicant must provide:
* An essay describing her interest and background in the information
  security field.
* A current transcript.
* A resume or CV.
* At least two letters of reference (typically from faculty members).
* Her university name and class status.

The scholarship is renewable for a second year subject to availability of
funds, given proof of satisfactory academic progress and available
funds. Scholars must be US citizens or permanent residents; funds are
available for use at any US campus of a US university.
