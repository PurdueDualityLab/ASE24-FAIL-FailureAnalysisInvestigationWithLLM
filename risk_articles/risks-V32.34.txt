The group known as Dragonfly and Energetic Bear has breached the power grid,
water-treatment facilities, and nuclear power plants.  In recent years they
have also breached WiFi systems at several airports -- including SFO and two
other U.S. west-coast airports (apparently attempting to find an
unidentified traveler).   [PGN-ed]

An unstable approach, a misaligned helmet and an ``overwhelmed'' flight
control system led to the crash of an Air Force F-35 at Eglin Air Force Base
in Florida last May. An Air Force accident report
<https://www.afjag.af.mil/Portals/77/AIB-Reports/2020/May/Eglin%20AFB%20F35A%20AIB%20Report_Signed.pdf>
released a few weeks ago found plenty of fault with the pilot's
actions but it was ultimately the airplane that wouldn't allow
itself to be saved. The plane's overworked processor set the
horizontal stabilizers to the ``default'' position of trailing edge down
just as the pilot initiated a go-around to try his landing again. When the
aircraft didn't respond to firewalled throttle and full back
pressure on the stick, the pilot ejected and the plane rolled, caught fire
and disintegrated. The pilot suffered minor injuries and the aircraft, worth
$175,983,949, became a debris field.

Faiz Siddiqui, *The Washington Post*, 21 Oct 2020
  via ACM TechNews, Friday, October 23, 2020

Electric automaker Tesla has selected a number of owners of its vehicles to
have a software update download automatically into those vehicles to enable
the cars to steer better and accelerate without human control. Critics are
troubled by the absence of LiDAR sensors, a safety feature used by most
self-driving car makers, from Tesla's system, which instead uses a suite of
cameras and radar linked to an advanced neural network. Tesla CEO Elon Musk
said the new software will better capture the exterior view of the vehicle
and more seamlessly integrate collected footage to create a multidimensional
perspective; safety experts disagree, warning the system cannot always
perceive the true shape or depth of obstacles. The Partners for Automated
Vehicle Education campaign said, "Public road testing is a serious
responsibility and using untrained consumers to validate beta-level software
on public roads is dangerous and inconsistent with existing guidance and
industry norms."

Subject: UK national police computer down for 10 hours after engineer pulled
  the plug

British police forces were plunged into chaos when the Police National
Computer (PNC) went down for more than 10 hours on 21 October 2020;
reportedly after an engineer unplugged it.

The system enables real-time checks on people and vehicles, and is the
backbone of the country's policing system.

It stores and shares criminal records information across the UK and is used
by law enforcement agencies and criminal justice agencies to access
information to support national, regional and local investigations.  It also
links with the Europe-wide Schengen information system, which shares
real-time information on persons and objects of interest.

The outage affected every aspect of policing, a police source said, adding:
``Without the PNC, you cannot police.  It is the backbone of intelligence
for everyday policing; so when it went down on Wednesday, it caused absolute
chaos.''

The glitch, which has been attributed to *human error*, left the National
Police Chiefs' Council scrambling to convene two emergency Gold Command
meetings of very senior police officers to address the problem.  Deputy
Chief Constable Naveed Malik, the National Police Chiefs Council lead for
the PNC, said: ``The PNC was temporarily affected by an electricity power
outage.  There is nothing to suggest it was related to malicious
activity. The police and Home Office worked closely together to restore the
system the same day, and are now reviewing the causes of this issue.  Police
forces were kept up to date and continued to deliver essential services to
protect our communities from harm.''

Whilst detail is not (yet) available, it is at once hard and easy to believe
that such a critical system could be vulnerable to total failure through the
action of one person "switching it off".

Subject: More on erroneous Alexa/third-party data provider evacuation notices
  in Boulder County, Colorado

I previously wrote that third-party services like Amazon's Alexa sent push
notifications informing owners located within an entire county of a
mandatory wildfire evacuation order, based upon a much narrower evacuation
notice sent out via NOAA All Hazards Radio (the precise area covered by the
order was delineated in the accompanying audio announcement.)

However, in talking to people familiar with the situation, the failure was
even worse than that:

Not only was the evacuation order disseminated, the third-party services
helpfully hyper-localized the message.

Rather than being told an evacuation order had been issued for a portion of
or all of Boulder County, you were informed an evacuation order had
specifically been issued for your precise location.

For example, if you live in Longmont, you were informed an evacuation order
had been issued for Longmont; if you live in Lafayette, you were informed an
evacuation order had been issued for Lafayette, and so on.

This deprived recipients of knowing the warning had been county-based to
begin with, let alone the context provided by the original accompanying
audio message.

These notifications were based solely upon assumptions made by the
third-party data service, not upon information created by or disseminated
via official sources of civil information.

This resulted in some panic as well as clogged incoming phone lines to
emergency services at a time when those phone lines needed to be kept clear.

It also forced harried emergency service organizations to have to issue
press releases letting people know they were not under an evacuation order.

Employees at Verkada accessed the company's facial recognition system to
take photos of women colleagues and make sexually explicit jokes.

Four employees who worked in different teams throughout Verkada said that
the culture of sexism at the company largely emanated from a cliquey group
of high-ranking white men on the sales team, many of them who grew up and
played high school football in same wealthy enclave, Danville, California,
some of whom went on to play for the NFL.

"If you're not invited into that core group of guys, you have a hard time

Cybersecurity researchers over the weekend disclosed new security risks

"Links shared in chats may contain private information intended only for the

CVI argues that the vast majority of its mailers are accurate, and while a
small percentage of people receive one with a mistake, they otherwise reach
voters who would be overlooked. But for years, CVI has been criticized for
the inaccuracy of its mailers and has faced reports that it has sent voter
registration forms to the deceased, to longtime voters who are already
registered and even to pets with human-sounding names.  Several state and
local election officials said that they have asked CVI to use more

Subject: Re: Air Force updates code on plane mid-flight (The Aviationist)

What code?  The U-2 is basically an F-104 with glider training wings -- the
only flying computers back in the early 1950's were slide rules!

The Skunk Works was able to deliver a U-2 prototype in 9 months because they
started with an existing airplane -- presumably including the entire cockpit
& controls.

So the pilot was updating his Android phone from 'Quince Tart' (10) to 'Red
Velvet Cake' (11) in mid-flight? :-) Pretty risky, considering how difficult
this plane is to fly.

Apparently, the U-2 is even harder to fly than the F-104, which is a pretty
high bar (NATO allies crashed F-104's in alarming numbers).

PS: The F-104 was my favorite plastic model airplane when I was a kid, and I
got to see a real one up close as a Cub Scout; I couldn't believe how small
it was (wingspan would fit in my current 2-car garage; length is about 3
parking spaces long).  Sadly, the first U-2 plastic model wasn't available
until 1962 -- long after I graduated from Cub Scouts!

I want to note the use of slanted language in their discussion of Facebook
and Twitter:

``Facebook limiting distribution is a bit like if a company that owned
newspaper delivery trucks decided not to drive because it didn't like a
story. Does a truck company edit the newspaper? It does now, apparently.''

If a company owns newspaper delivery trucks doesn't want to deliver
newspapers with a story its owners don't like, that's their privilege.  And
the newspapers can decide not to use that company any more.

"Freedom of the press belongs to the man who owns the press." Same with the
delivery company.

Maybe not, but they should. That is what free speech is about: my right to
say what I want (within some very broad limits) and, equally important, not
to say what I don't want to.

> Not even radical free-market libertarians espouse such a pro-corporate view.

I do, and I'm not a "radical free-market libertarian". To be fair, I used to
be, but I think that the theoretical grounding of libertarianism has some
significant holes in it.

"unique legal benefits": those same legal benefits protect Reddit and 4chan
and Tumbler, and a BBS that I help moderate and several "furry" that I use,
all of which include some sexually-oriented material. I think section 230 of
the Communications Decency Act is the greatest boon to free speech ever
passed by Congress. (And to think it appeared in a law that attempted to
impose censorship on the Internet...)

That said, I must note that any large social-media company intentionally
biasing the material they distribute is a bad idea, because it endangers
Section 230, which also protects smaller "Web 2.0" organizations.  Including
any startups that might eventually challenge Facebook and Twitter. In fact,
I might wonder if they did this intentionally to push Congress to make more
exceptions to Section 230.

As always, regulation protects the existing providers (who can hire people
to help comply with the regulations and lawyers to defend them against
accusations of breaking them) against competition from smaller
providers. This is as true of Facebook and Twitter as it is of taxi
companies (until Uber and Lyft found a way around the regulation) and
AirBnB.

Okay, so FB has a lot of economic power. Why? Because they have been highly
successful in satisfying consumer demand for a place to talk to each other.

I should note that there are a lot of very rich Republicans. I would guess
that over 75% of billionaires lean Conservative in their views.  Let them
take some of their money and start right-slanted competitors to Facebook and
Twitter. It's not cheap, but it's well within the reach of any ten
billionaires, and if they do it right they might get even richer in the
process.

That's what the competition in the marketplace is supposed to be about.  If
the "barrier to entry" is simply that you need to invest some money, that is
no barrier in an age when the the US alone has over 500 billionaires, over
2,000 worldwide.

Old-car enthusiasts usually agree that it's a good idea to have an MoT
(annual vehicle inspection) even if it's not mandatory, if only to avoid any
insurance and liability awkwardness ("these dangerous old clunkers!").
There is a caveat, in the sense that regular MoTs aren't subject to VAT
(goods and services tax) whereas voluntary ones are, so this means some
extra paperwork for the garage, which may not welcome your business.

The London low-emission charge web site says:
(https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone/ways-to-meet-the-standard)

Hence older vehicles are particularly badly hit as it's only ones meeting
very recent standards that are permitted.  There are congestion charge
exemptions for some specific vehicle types, e.g. those for disabled people
or recovery vehicles -- loads of paperwork needed to verify.
(https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge/discounts-and-exemptions?intcmp=2133)

I couldn't see anything for historic vehicles, so it looks like drivers on
the annual London-to-Brighton antiques run will have to pay up.  This all
applies to London, with other cities having their own schemes.

As readers will have gathered, the official line is that people shouldn't
really use cars, to save the planet and avoid suffocating residents; the
authorities are spending loads of taxpayers' money on a walking and cycling
revolution -- who wants to drive anyway?  :o)
