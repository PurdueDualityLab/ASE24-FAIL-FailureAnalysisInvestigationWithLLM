Subject: Single point of failure in the Berlin Train System

The Berlin light rail train system, plagued by problems for years,
demonstrated today that it can, indeed get worse. Many cars have been taken
out of service for all sorts of ailments, and having pruned the maintenance
shops and the drivers to a bare minimum, there is no room for dealing with
problems. And there have been problems galore.

Berliners joked that it could not possibly get worse, but today (15 Dec
2011) the S-Bahn proved that it could, indeed, because it has a single point
of failure. All switches, all electronic signals, all information is
centralized in one station in Halensee. And the electricity went out during
a routine test of the emergency electrical system today, according to RBB
[1], a local news station.  The emergency system did not kick in - and then
nothing worked.

Only two train lines that still have analogue signals and switches were in
operation, the rest was out - and the central operations was also
affected. They had no information on where the trains were.

Many people were trapped in trains stranded between stations.  Angry
passengers opened the doors, got out and walked the tracks to the nearest
station, continuing by bus, subway, or taxi.

It took about 3 hours after electricity was restored to have some sort of
traffic running. The Internet information page by the S-Bahn was down, the
server was not able to cope with the traffic.  Customers used Twitter to
announce trains in motion, helping people to find some way to get to work or
school.

Ford is significantly changing what a driver or passenger experiences in its

Subject: Risks of focusing on risks

There are all sorts of articles about the risks of talking on a cell phone
while driving -- even hands free -- in a car and an effort to ban them.

The problem is that these processes seem to focus primarily on risks.  Have
these studies looked at the benefits of not being isolated while driving?
The reports do make an exception for navigation systems even though they can
be very distracting. That's a case where the benefits are, perhaps, too
obvious to ignore.

Yet if we remove all distractions driving becomes very dangerous -- that's
why roads are now designed with curves rather than being straight for many
miles.

How do we get balanced policies rather than policies focused on eliminating
risks? And without taking risks how do we advance understanding and
technology?

There's also another issue -- the policymakers seem to assume that a GPS
navigator is a device. But today it's just an app and a cell phone is just a
generic communicating platform. So, inevitably, in a software-defined world
the efforts to ban devices become commingled with attempts to control
behavior.

Subject: ACMA: Facebook photos are not private, even with "privacy" enabled

OK, the concept of "privacy" and the whole raison d'être for Facebook are
diametrically opposed, but you would have hoped that a regulator would put
at least *some* effort into protecting the innocent.

http://www.itnews.com.au/News/284896,acma-finds-facebook-photos-are-not-private.aspx

  "Australia's communications regulator has ruled that television networks
  are not breaking the industry's code of practice when publishing photos
  lifted from a public Facebook profile."

OK, I can sort of follow that one - it's freely accessible. There looms
the eternal copyright question, though, but OK - but worse was to come.

  "Channel Seven did not breach the Commercial Television Industry Code of
  Practice when it accessed and broadcast photographs -- specifically in
  the case of a deceased person lifted from a Facebook tribute page, and
  another which broadcast the name, photograph and comments penned by a
  14-year old boy."

OK, this was enough to hit the buffers for me. The former is a matter of
public decency (I know, I know, I'm old fashioned), but the latter throws up
a thoroughly evil question that I will post in a minute as a separate
message.

Now for the killer:

  "The ACMA was begrudgingly unable to guarantee that users marking content
  as `private' on a social network could be safe guarded from broadcasters
  and publishers making it public, at least under the industry code of
  practice."

The ACMA made it clear that while it considers the use of privacy settings
an important consideration when assessing material obtained from social
networking sites, the actual settings are not determinative, the regulator
noted.

Instead, the regulator will determine matters taken before it on a
case-by-case basis."

Let me see if I get this correctly: even when a user has flagged the
explicit WITHHOLDING of consent for public use by marking something private
(which suggests an access control mechanism of some sorts which requires
breaching either by password hacks, or by asking a "friend" (cough) to get
at the data, the use of such material is perfectly OK?  Excuse me?

Words fail me. And privacy in Australia, apparently.

  "Facebook will begin adding photos of its users to third-party adverts
  appearing in users' news feeds come early next year, so if you're the sort
  who's a bit free with your thumbs-up button, there's no way out of being
  featured alongside a tin of baked beans or a pair of knickers on the
  social network."
  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/12/21/facebook_sponsored_stories/

I'm not quite sure what exactly they are smoking at Facebook HQ, but I would
advise to avoid it at all costs, zap any image which features your face and
start warming up your lawyers.

What Facebook is planning to do appears to me principally deceptive
marketing.  If your face is somehow associated with a product it will appear
as an endorsement - and endorsement you didn't intend, most likely would not
consent to if you were aware of it (which you won't), and may associate you
with any problems the product may have.  In other words, Facebook is about
to use your credibility and reputation for free, leaving you with the
liability and representational loss if the product isn't up to scratch.
Absolutely *great* for double-glazing selling..

Well, that's the end of profile pictures, I think.  Even more fun will be
the abuse of publicity images as used by fake profiles - as far as I can
see, the only people winning here are lawyers.

Am I missing something or have they really come off the rails now?

Subject: Re: Internet Hysteria ... (Brett Glass, R-26.67)

The inability to control volume is merely the tip of the iceberg when it
comes to the media consumer's lack of control.

However, thanks to the wonders of modern computers & digital signal
processing, those persons consuming their media via a _computer_, rather
than a consumer electronic device, finally have significantly more control.

"MP3Gain" and its competitors allows the user to pre-process the audio gain
of mp3 files so that even when played back on "dumb" mp3 devices, the sound
volume will be within the range selected by the user.  I have used these
types of programs for years to enable me to be able to hear mp3's on
airplanes where the ambient noise is simply too high.

If you are utilizing the outstanding "VLC" media player on your laptop
computer, you have even greater control.  For example, the VLC player can
play back at speeds significantly greater than normal, but _without changing
the pitch_, so that you can zoom through boring podcasts & videos at 1.5x or
greater speeds.

The VLC player also has a "Volume Normalizer", which provides "dynamic volume compression" for noisy environments.  See below.

It is essential that digital media consumers be allowed to digitally
remaster their content to tailor it for their own consumption.  In some
cases, this can be an advantage for the content creators: e.g., when I set
VLC playback to 1.5x, I can consume 50% more content!

http://www.ab9il.net/digital-audio/vlc-audio-dynamics.html

"Effective Audio compression for Loud or Sensitive Environments.

"The VLC media player, short for VideoLan, is a very versatile player for
nearly any audio or video format.  It is an excellent application for home
theater computers, laptops, netbooks, tablet computers, or any Mac, Linux,
or Windows device used for multimedia playback.  It can even stream media
over a local or global network.  VLC is the media player of choice due in
part to its ease of use on the popular operating systems and its many useful
plugins.

"One aspect of its flexibility that is not well utilized by many VLC users
is its ability to manipulate the audio dynamics of the media it is playing.
In other words, the Volume Normalizer can be configured to compensate for
loud and quiet variations of a movie, podcast, or segment of music.  Such a
feature is very useful when using VLC in a loud environment: on an airplane,
in a busy cafe, in an office area, or on a street.  Some VLC users in
schools, watching pre-recorded lectures, may need the audio dynamics set to
provide clarity in a sound sensitive environment.  The audio compression
then automatically controls loudness to prevent distraction to others who
may be nearby."

I was thinking about this when I saw the first "Robocop" movie, when the

what kind of brain-dead moron actually loads ordnance into a machine
undergoing a test in a civilian environment?  Of course it would have made
the story fail, but Dick Jones, as head of the ED-209 project should have
been fired on the spot for incompetence, and whoever ordered actual
ammunition put into the thing should have been prosecuted at least for
involuntary manslaughter.  This was inexcusable negligence beyond mere
incompetence or even stupidity, it borders on arrogant willful misconduct.

Even if you don't give one damn about human life, killing corporate
executives is unacceptable because it's very expensive over some schlub on
the shop floor in a factory: you have to pay their death benefits from
worker's comp based on their income which is a lot higher, you have to cash
out their remaining contract, and possibly other benefits have to be paid,
plus a dead-bang winner of a juicy high-dollar suit by their survivors for
negligence.  Not to mention the bad press in the newspapers might cause the
stock price to go down.  Killing director-level or corporate officer
executives is going to be a lot more expensive than just having some factory
worker killed, say in a disaster because your maintenance is sub-par (like
BP and the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Exxon of Mexico, err I mean
Gulf of Mexico.)

The title of the note in RISKS-26.67 said the accident was "Blamed on
Software". I think this is misleading. The anomaly involved electronic data
generation and transmission engineering, nothing with which a software
engineer could be expected to have either experience or expertise.

Qantas Flight 72, flown by VH-QPA, an Airbus 330-303, suffered pitch
anomalies in cruise near Learmonth, Western Australia, in October 2008. It
pitched down suddenly, injuring some 106 passengers and 9 cabin crew, some
severely. An emergency was declared and the airplane landed at Learmonth,
Western Australia, to enable timely medical treatment for the injured.

It has been known for some time (and was published in the interim reports)
that the pitch-down was caused by data spikes in angle-of-attack data from
one air data computer (ADIRU), which were taken as veridical by the primary
flight control computers (FCPC or PRIM) because two similar spikes occurred
just outside the time window in the filtering algorithm. The reconciliation
between these values and those of the other two ADIRUs allowed this
anomalous value to prevail, and the aircraft accordingly pitched nose-down.

as discussion of the certification requirements as the ATSB sees them, may

OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE

Applying formal methods may involve the modeling of different aspects of a
system that are expressed through different paradigms.  Correspondingly,
different analysis techniques will be used to examine differently modeled
system views, different kinds of properties, or simply in order to cope with
the sheer complexity of the system.  The iFM conference series seeks to
further research into the combination of (formal and semi-formal) methods
for system development, regarding modeling and analysis, and covering all
aspects from language design through verification and analysis techniques to
tools and their integration into software engineering practice.
