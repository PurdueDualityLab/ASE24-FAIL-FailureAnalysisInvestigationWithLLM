Subject: `Switch incompatibility' leads to two helicopter ditchings

In 2012, two Super Puma helicopters with a total of 33 people on board were
forced to ditch in the North Sea when both the primary and emergency main
router lubrication systems failed.  Everyone survived with only minor
injuries.

The main router lubrication system in both aircraft failed due to fatigue
cracking in a critical part, and the pilots activated the emergency
lubrication system, which sprays glycol into the rotor and gives the
aircraft 30 minutes' safe flying time.  However, on both helicopters a
warning light illuminated indicating that this emergency system failed as
well, forcing them to ditch immediately (per their procedures).

It turns out that the emergency lubrication systems were working fine, but
the switch that was supposed to detect its failure was wired incorrectly,
meaning that the warning light would *always* illuminate shortly after the
system's activation.  The aircraft manufacturer made an early design change
affecting the switch's pin assignments but, when it re-ordered the switches,
it used the original specification by mistake.  This was compounded by the
fact that 'the emergency lubrication sub-systems were tested individually,
[but] no test was carried out on the complete system during certification,
either on a test rig or installed on a helicopter'.

Subject: Interconnection of Three Previously Separated Networks in Boeing 737

"Special Conditions" refers to the fact that certification rules haven't
kept pace. The three network domains (aircraft control, operator
information, and passenger entertainment) used to run on physically separate
wires, primarily for historical reasons, but having obvious engineering
benefits as well. In recent years, first the computers and now the networks
have migrated to virtual machine separation on shared hardware, for the
equally obvious space, weight, and power savings. The *Federal Register*
rule published this week mentions interconnection between at least two of
the three domains; I hope they paid close attention to UC Berkeley's
"Experimental Security Analysis of a Modern Automobile" (2010).

Spreadsheet programs should have the precision of their numbers (# of 000s)

responsible for decisions involving billions & trillions of dollars won't be
able to use them to make such large mistakes. ;-)

You shouldn't use a spreadsheet for important work (I mean it).

I envy economists. Unlike computer scientists, they seem to be able to
publish best-seller books with innovative research.  One such book is
Pikettys Capital.  The book is reminiscent of Marxs capital in its scope.
If you haven't heard about the book yet, it has a simple message: the yield
on capital is higher than wage growth, which means that those with the
capital are bound to get richer and more powerful.  The bulk of the
population is doomed.  A small elite will soon collect all the wealth,
leaving none for the regular folks.

Subject: Cell phones as TEMPEST analyzers (David Shamah)

David Shamah, With New Hack, Cellphone Can Get Data Out of Computers, *Times
of Israel* 9 Jun 2014,
http://www.timesofisrael.com/with-new-hack-cellphone-can-get-data-out-of-computers/

Professor Yuval Elovici, head of Ben Gurion University's Cyber Security Lab,
has demonstrated software that allows a cell phone to spy on the activities
of a nearby computer even though there is no connection between the phone
and the computer.

Unlike some "malware crosses air gap, time to panic" stories, this one
actually seems plausible, although there's not enough detail in the press to
understand what's actually happening. It is true, however, that computers
generate potentially analyzable radio noise and that cell phones incorporate
increasingly software-defined (i.e., re-programmable) radios.

The article implies that the demonstration used software both on the phone
and on the computer. That makes the job vastly simpler, of course, because
it means the software (which the article plausibly says used the video
hardware) can generate exactly the right "noise" for the receiver.

Could a normal cellphone have its radio re-programmed to receive and analyze
_unintentional_ signals? Are the radios sophisticated enough to enable that
sort of analysis? Are cellphone antennas good enough?  This sort of attack
is usually portrayed as being performed from a van in the parking lot with a
big antenna and lots of equipment--but a phone could plausibly be 6 feet
away instead of 60, and could get away with much less antenna. The diversity
of (undocumented) radio hardware makes a universal attack seem unlikely, but
still...

It's an interesting report. Clearly, there's potential for a customized
mobile device to do this. And that customization might consist of new radio
firmware in a shiny new iPhone.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/06/09/nsa-our-systems-are-so-complex-we-cant-stop-them-from-deleting-data-wanted-for-lawsuit/

The National Security Agency recently used a novel argument for not holding
onto information it collects about users online activity: it's too complex.

The agency is facing a slew of lawsuits over its surveillance programs, many
launched after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked information on
the agency's efforts last year. One suit that pre-dates the Snowden leaks,
Jewel v. NSA, challenges the constitutionality of programs that the suit
allege collect information about American's telephone and Internet
activities.

In a hearing Friday, U.S. District for the Northern District of California
Judge Jeffrey S. White reversed an emergency order he had issued earlier the
same week barring the government from destroying data that the Electronic
Frontier Foundation had asked be preserved for that case. The data is
collected under Section 702 of the Amendments Act to the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act. ...

Subject: Turning everyone's home router into a WiFi hotspot

Xfinity is rolling out a new service where by default all of the home
routers will become hotspots for other Xfinity customers.  The claim is that
it won't use up the bandwidth of the "host" provider because it's a separate
bandwidth section.  (Not sure I believe it, but that's what they say.)
Xfinity says that all users will be authenticated before connecting.  If you
use your own router, then it doesn't get enabled.

Pros: If you are one of their customers, you can get WiFi service in a lot
more places (free).

Cons: What happens if someone uses your WiFi hotspot to conduct a criminal
act?  Xfinity says that the "host" won't be liable.  But that seems to me a
legal question, not a policy question for Xfinity to decide.  And if police
monitor (for example) child porn coming through a router, will they be tech
savvy enough to understand that "oh yeah, that's one of those Xfinity
things, so we should believe the homeowner when they say 'not me'"?

And of course the additional risk is that enabling this feature increases
the attack surface within the router, since unknown people (even if they
are Xfinity customers) are now inside your network.  Since many people
leave devices open on their home network (on the understanding that "it's
behind the firewall"), a break in the router from the outside guests to the
inside host could put a lot at risk.

This could also increase the value of an Xfinity customer's
username/password, since knowing that information now gives access to a
nationwide WiFi network.  Hopefully they're doing more authentication than
just a password, but I doubt it.

Lots of coverage, some of it pointing out the risks.  For example:

Subject: Comcast is turning your home router into a public WiFi hotspot

FYI -- Houston, you have a problem.

I had to check my calendar twice to make sure that it wasn't April 1st.
Given the hackability of home routers in general, this sounds like perhaps
the worst idea I've ever heard.  And these Comcast people want to sell you
*home security* services???

Among other things, Comcast will be able to track smartphones all over
Houston as they move around from hotspot to hotspot.  Comcast apparently
envies NSA & ATT, and wants to get into the action.

I especially liked the part about "people using the Internet via the hotspot
won't slow down Internet access on the home network.  Additional capacity is
allotted to handle the bandwidth."  So perhaps Comcast has been lying about
that upstream bandwidth problem all along?

On the other hand, ubiquitous wifi coverage of Houston may convince many
people to "cut the cord" to their cellphone carrier & use wifi exclusively.

Subject: Controlling Your Smart Home With One Hub (Molly Wood)

Molly Wood, *The New York Times*, 11 Jun 2014

The smart home is full of promise: Coffee makers that turn on when you wake
up, garage doors that open when you come home, relaxing music that is
controlled remotely and air-conditioners and thermostats that perfectly
regulate the home and save you money, too.

Promise is rarely reality, though. Smart-home automation is a tricky and
chaotic corner of tech right now. Companies are rushing to join the fray,
buoyed in part by the success of the Nest Learning Thermostat, and Google's
$3.2 billion acquisition of Nest.

For consumers, putting together a smart home remains mostly a do-it-yourself
project. You choose your components, connect them to your home network and
start living your connected life. Companies like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T
offer monitoring systems, but they don't offer much flexibility. And
installing a complete home automation and security system can cost tens of
thousands of dollars.

The trouble is that for anyone pursuing this as a D.I.Y. project, the more
devices you bring home, the more separate apps you need to control
them. Suddenly, convenience becomes cumbersome. ...

Subject: Aereo wants a TV revolution, if the Supreme Court will let it
  (Scott Helman)

Can a daring entrepreneur from Newton and his team of technologists upend
the way we watch TV? Only if the Supreme Court doesn't quash their idea
first.

Scott Helman, *The Boston Globe*, 05 Jun 2014

DON'T CALL CHET KANOJIA A DISRUPTER. First, it's hackneyed. "You go around
in [Silicon] Valley, every punk is running around saying, you know,
'Disrupt, disrupt, disrupt,' " he says. "It's like, 'Dude, you have no idea
what you're talking about.' "

Kanojia, a Newton entrepreneur who's trying to lead a TV revolution, does
know what he's talking about. Which brings us to his second
objection. Disruption, he says, is too often conflated with destruction,
which is not his goal. He's not out to destroy TV networks or the cable
industry, he insists. Just to make things better for viewers. "Something's
gotta give," he says, citing continued increases in cable rates. "Otherwise
you end up in a system where it's another mortgage payment."

Indeed, doesn't the cable bill loom large in those late-night, kids-in-bed
budget discussions at the kitchen table? You shell out a bundle, and the
bundle only grows-the average bill for a pay TV subscription alone is on
track to reach $123 a month next year and $200 by 2020, according to a 2012
projection from market research firm NPD Group. And yet you ask yourself:
What am I paying for? How many of those channels do I actually watch? ...

Subject: 60 new state privacy laws in last 12 months

States Enacting New Privacy Laws; Congress Creates a Vacuum in the Field

State legislators have been extraordinarily busy in the past 14 months
enacting privacy protective legislation. During the same period, Congress
did not pass any notable pro-privacy reforms. Federal proposals to ban use
of credit reports in employment decisions, to limit employers' access to
Facebook accounts, and to require notifications of leaks of personal
information (data breaches) have not moved forward in four years.

SL Cover2013 privacy journal has counted more than 60 important laws on
privacy enacted by state legislators in the 12 months since publication of
its 2013 Compilation of State and Federal Privacy Laws. The new laws are
described and cited in the 2014 Supplement, available in hard copy or pdf
email attachment for $16. The 2013 book with the supplement included is $40
(postage included) and the digital version is $28.50.

The book and supplement describe each law, grouped by states and by
categories, and include the legal citation of each state law.

Facebook Passwords

A total of 17 states, 12 of them in the past year, have passed laws
restricting employers from demanding social-media passwords or access to
personal sites belonging to applicants or employees. In recent months ten
states have extended these protections to students in higher
education. Louisiana, Michigan, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, and Washington
State have extended this protection to students in high schools and
secondary schools as well. Wisconsin includes landlords in the prohibition.

Surveillance by Drones

Lawmakers in blue and red states alike have turned their attention to
regulating law enforcement's use of unmanned aircraft for surveillance
(drones). New laws in nine states require the government to have court
approval before using drones for surveillance or for capturing images. North
Carolina and Virginia have enacted moratoria on drone use by the government,
both expiring in mid-2015. Oregon requires state registration of all drones
and bans their uses as weapons.

Access to Metadata

Montana is apparently the first state to limit government agencies from
getting access to location information from telephone providers (metadata)
unless there is consent, an emergency, a search warrant, or a report of a
stolen device. Texas seems to be the first and only state to require by
statute a court warrant for law enforcement to procure email content. The
law is written in such a way as to authorize access to email as much as to
restrict it.  The statute claims that Texas authorities may seize email
content outside of Texas.

Ban-the-Box

There has been a significant campaign throughout the U.S. to `ban-the-box'.
That is the box found on many job applications asking whether Applicants
have ever been arrested or convicted.  Many applicants have said that
checking the box virtually assures that an application will be ditched.

Therefore, reformers have asked state legislators to enact ban-the-box
laws. The laws require elimination of the inquiry, whether it is in writing
or verbally, until an applicant has been determined to meet the minimum
requirements for a position and moves to the second stage of consideration
for a job, usually an interview.

Hawaii passed the first ban-the-box law in the nation, in 1998. In the past
18 months, ten states have followed suit. Some laws cover government
employment; others cover public and private employment. In addition, Georgia
and Illinois have banned the box administratively since last October. North
Carolina has a ban-the-box alternative affecting state licensing boards.

Employers' Electronic Monitoring

Connecticut and Delaware now prohibit electronic monitoring of employees
without advance notice.

California legislators continue to occupy themselves with advancing the
pro-privacy laws in their state. In the past 12 months, they required Web
sites to notify the public that they are forbidden from using personal data
about minors in marketing. Kids have rights to remove some data about
themselves from Web sites.

Smart-Grid Restrictions

Utilities in California are restricted in secondary uses of customer data in
so-called smart grid technology, which allows precise pricing based on
usage. This is the first such law in the nation.

Californians now have rights to have Web sites disclose how they respond to
do not track signals and whether third parties collect marketing data from
the principal Web site or app.

The legislature extended the state's medical confidentiality protections to
apps. And it toughened the anti-paparazzi law, now making it a crime to
harass a child because of the parent's employment.

It's not clear to me what the risks are in "Eugene Goostman" convincing
someone the software is a 13-year old boy.

Do we now envisage some sort of smart war-dialing virtual kid con
artist fleecing people?

Or do we envisage smart software being given too much responsibility
such as chat-bot suicide counseling or such?

Or is the risk that real chatting support people are more likely to be
assumed to be bots?  In the Most Human Human, Brian Christian muses that as
a human control in the above competition, he could answer questions in such
a way as to be perceived as being a machine.  This has happened to me via
email when I replied too quickly with a fairly bland email to customers
reporting problems at my company.  Is the risk in this case that end-users
refuse help from perceived bots?

I have found studies reporting people sometimes much more or much less
likely to surrender personal information to automated (online) versus human
moderated paper surveys.  I am guessing the online ones are trusted a lot
less these days, but my point is that people may now surrender more personal
information to bots they think are people.

as 1890, when utilities used Steam Engines to generate electric power for
distribution. Keeping boilers fired up at low use periods wasted fuel and
overbuilding steam generation capacity for short term demand peaks wasted
the capital needed to provide the generation capacity.

The TVA pumped storage facility at Raccoon Mountain has a net dependable
capacity of 1,652 megawatts and stores energy generated at coal fired and
nuclear plants. Glacier retreat creates potential locations where pumped
storage generators could be built without disrupting existing ecosystems
any more than the meltdown of the glaciers already has.

The same challenge of excess thermal power comes up 124 years later.

Nuclear plants do not respond well to power levels being lowered and can
take days to get back to full power if they are shut down abruptly. We
were reminded of that by the Northeast transmission failure, August 2013

cip.management.dal.ca/publications/Ontario%20-%20US%20Power%20Outage%20-%20Impacts%20on%20Critical%20Infrastructure.pdf

"Steamers" often have unused capacity at night. There is only so much that can
be done in terms of finding night time clients for that excess capacity. Enron
demonstrated how long it takes to reheat a "steamer" after letting it cool.

Subject: TrueCrypt.com reported compromised -- Caution Advised

The TrueCrypt.com site apparently has a compromised set of binaries. The
SourceForge TrueCrypt site has an advisory to switch to BitLocker.  The
published reports are unclear whether the sites have been hijacked, or
whether this is a deliberate act on the part of the development team.  This
raises two risks:

* The risk of relying on the availability of reliable distribution kits from
online repositories. It emphasizes the need to burn local copies of
installed software, lest the online repository be compromised or disappear.

* How well regulated are online repositories routinely used by large
communities of users.

>It is a regrettable truth that SSL certificates are a very expensive thing

While I share your skepticism about the current security value of a
signed cert, it's simply not true that they're expensive, and it
hasn't been true for many years.

Startcom (https://www.startssl.com/) will sign certs for free, $0.00, and
all current browsers accept them.  If that's not good enough, you can buy
Comodo certs for $5/yr or Geotrust for $8/yr from resellers like ssls.com.

Subject: Re: German Green Energy, also Car 'Dash Cams' (RISKS-27.93)

In the UK we have (I think) *two* such power stations - effectively giant
batteries.

They were constructed to provide power surges to match peaks in demand -- in
the days of just three or four TV channels and no video recorders, the ad
breaks would trigger huge surges in demand as maybe four or five million
households would switch on their kettles in the space of 30 seconds. That
was the time needed for these power stations to go from 0W to 500MW.

The station I know of for certain is in Wales where they have a large
reservoir at the top of a mountain. At night, when demand is low and just
the baseload generators are running, cheap electricity is used to pump water
from the reservoir at the bottom to the reservoir at the top.  When demand
peaks, these stations are ready to provide a quick surge of hydro-electric
power.

But these stations could just as easily be used to smooth out the supply in
a nation of irregular green energy. Basic stats says that can predict
roughly how much power you're going to get over the day (and year) and you
can store surplus power and use it to smooth out the supply.

Subject: Brute force attack actually selected plaintext?

In RISKS-27.97, I saw the term "brute force attack" misused yet
again. Selected plaintext seems more like the proper term for it. The
password attacks actually observed tend to be using known password guessing
followed by likely password guessing. And this is not the same as brute
force - which essentially never works remotely against password systems with
minor delays for retry and at least 8 characters of length.

I think we should be more careful in our word usage.
