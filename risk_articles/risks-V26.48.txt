Subject: United Airlines system-wide computer failure

Passengers were stranded at airports across the country Friday night [17 Jun
2011]after a failure in United Airlines' computer system.  The disruption
set off widespread delays at airports in San Francisco, Chicago and
Washington, with many passengers left sitting in terminals or stuck on
planes that were grounded.  United said in a statement that the problems
began at 8:15 p.m. New York time, when the computer failure knocked out its
flight departures, airport processing and reservations systems. The
statement did not address the nationwide delays, and a spokesman did not
return a phone call seeking comment.

I first heard about the electronic currency Bitcoin from this article:

Naturally, I was a bit skeptical about a so-called currency not backed up by
a government or hard assets, but the implementation seemed technically
sweet.  I didn't have to wait long for my doubts to be confirmed.
  http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=21877

Oooh!  Loses a third of its value in one day!  I better watch the market
a little longer before jumping in.

Whoa!  Some guy got hacked and lost bitcoins "worth" $500,000.
This is obviously not a game for amateurs.  Wonder what that guy
was doing with so many bitcoins in the first place?
  http://www.dailytech.com/Inside+the+MegaHack+of+Bitcoin+the+Full+Story/article21942.htm

Yikes!  The main bitcoin exchange just got robbed for $8.75M!  What were the
purported reasons for using this "currency"?  I know the arguments that the
guy who got hacked wasn't using proper security (he admits it) and the
problem at the exchange had nothing to do with the underlying Bitcoin
technology model.  I tend to think, though, that a currency invented by an
anonymous computer programmer is not something to jump right into.  If it's
still around in 10 years, I might re-evaluate, but in the meantime I'll
stick to currencies that have been around a couple hundred years.

SecurIDs Come Under Siege:
Security Breach Forces RSA to Offer to Replace Millions of 'Tokens'

Siobhan Gorman and Shara Tibken, *The Wall Street Journal*, 7 Jun 2011

RSA Security is offering to provide security monitoring or replace its
well-known SecurID tokens-devices used by millions of corporate workers to
securely log on to their computers-"for virtually every customer we have,"
the company's Chairman Art Coviello said in an interview.

In a letter to customers Monday, the EMC Corp. unit openly acknowledged for
the first time that intruders had breached its security systems at defense
contractor Lockheed Martin Corp. using data stolen from RSA.

SecurID tokens have become a fixture of office life at thousands of
corporations, used when employees log onto computers or sensitive software
systems. The token is an essential piece of security, acting as an
ever-changing password that flashes a series of six digits that should be
virtually impossible to duplicate. ...

Subject: Fwd: British Spies Replace Terrorists' Online Bomb Instructions
 with Cupcake Recipe

Paisley Dodd, 3 Jun 2011

LONDON -- Britain's spy agencies have a new message for terrorists: make
cupcakes, not war.  Intelligence agents managed to hack into the extremist
Inspire magazine, replacing its bomb-making instructions with a recipe for
cupcakes.  It's the first time the agents sabotaged the English-language
magazine linked to U.S.-born Yemeni cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, an extremist
accused in several recent terror plots.

The quarterly online magazine, which is sent to websites and email
addresses as a pdf file, had offered an original page titled "Make a
Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom" in one of its editions last year.
The magazine's pages were corrupted, however, and the instructions
replaced with the cupcake recipe. ...

Duncan Gardham, Security Correspondent, 02 Jun 2011

The cyber-warfare operation was launched by MI6 and GCHQ in an attempt to
disrupt efforts by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsular to recruit "lone-wolf"
terrorists with a new English-language magazine, the Daily Telegraph

magazine by the British intelligence hackers, was actually a web page of
recipes for "The Best Cupcakes in America" published by the Ellen DeGeneres
chat show. ...

Nelson D. Schwartz and Christopher Drew, RSA Faces Angry Users After Breach
*The New York Times*, 7 Jun 2011
http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/08/business/08security.html

The nation's biggest banks and large technology companies like SAP rushed
Tuesday to accept RSA Security's offer to replace their ubiquitous SecurID
tokens as many computer security experts voiced frustration with the
company.

The company's admission of the RSA tokens' vulnerability on Monday was a
shock to many customers because it came so long after a hacking attack on
RSA in March and one on Lockheed Martin last month. The concern of customers
and consultants over the way RSA, a unit of the tech giant EMC, communicated
also raises the possibility that many customers will seek alternative
solutions to safeguard remote access to their computer networks.

Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup said they planned
to replace the tokens as soon as possible. The banks declined to say how
many customers would be affected, although SAP said that most of its 50,000
employees used RSA's tokens and that it was seeking to replace them all. ...

Customers angry at RSA over delay in admitting depth of breach
http://j.mp/j2IwKk  (This message in Google Buzz)
http://j.mp/jlNAhg  (New York Times)

  "For now, however, the biggest worry for RSA is how to appease angry
  customers as well as mollify computer security consultants, who have been
  increasingly critical of how long it took the company to acknowledge the
  severity of the problem."

Just a quick opinion: Once a firm has a reasonable handle on the depth
of a security problem that will affect customers, it is in both the
company's and the customers' best interests for the firm to "come
clean" at least regarding the seriousness of the situation, even if
all technical details are not yet available or in a form that can be
reasonably communicated with customers.

It is crucial that users understand to what extent they may have been
made vulnerable, so that they can take appropriate protective steps
themselves at least in the short run.

Most of all, trying to publicly minimize the seriousness of a
situation below the level you know to be true, or lying about how
serious matters really are, can be counted upon to make a bad
situation worse.

This applies pretty much equally in technology and in the rest of our
lives (just ask Rep. Anthony Weiner).

US-based companies would be required to report data breaches that threaten
consumer privacy and could face stiff penalties for concealing them under
federal legislation that was introduced in the Senate on Tuesday.

The Personal Data Privacy and Security Act aims to set national standards
for protecting the growing amount of personally identifiable information
being stored online. Its approval by the Senate Judiciary Committee
represents the fourth year the bill has been introduced, said its sponsor,
Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont.  The latest incarnation comes amid a glut
of high-profile hack attacks on networks operated by Sony, email marketer
Silverpop Systems, gossip publisher Gawker Media, and others, which have
exposed sensitive data for hundreds of millions of Americans in the past six
months.

Subject: Spyware, the FBI, and The Failure of ISPs (John Dvorak)

John C. Dvorak, 1 Jun 2011

Why can't ISPs routinely look at network activity and use deep-packet
sniffing to find infected machines and tell the customer in the first place?

Operation Adeona, it was called. It involved the FBI. Spyware.
Intrigue. Controversy. The FBI took it upon itself to attack one of the
miserable botnets that plagues the Internet to figure out how to intercept
its "calling home function." And essentially it ended up giving it new and
less destructive instructions. Let me try to explain.

Botnets generally consist of thousands of infected computers that have some
specific piece of malware installed. Your computer at home may be one of
them. The malicious code is usually in the form of a Trojan Horse that was
planted by a Web site or some code you mistakenly clicked on. Once installed
on your computer it doesn't really do much until called into action.

The idea nowadays is to inhabit your machine for nefarious purposes
including mailing spam from your account, pinging a target computer to
harass someone, or even to do odd sorts of market research. Most of the time
these infected machines do their dirty work after hours and seldom during
the day when an observant owner might spot the dubious activity.

It is a public nuisance. I cannot emphasize enough how people should run
some good scanners to ferret out these programs. Millions of machines are
infected.

Anyway, so the FBI decided to counterattack one of the major botnets called
Coreflood, which is used to loot bank accounts. The FBI was to replace the
servers communicating with infected Coreflood machines with its own servers,
and also to disable the Coreflood malware on the infected machines. This
process seems to have gone well and the botnet was mostly silenced and had
no way of getting any more nefarious instructions, rendering it useless. The
problem is that the code is still on the machines. Now it gets dicey. ...

Subject: Re: Skype is reportedly reverse-engineered (RISKS-26.46)

I've always been wary of Skype for their SBO stance, despite the many
security friends who have used it, love it, and promote it at every turn.
Prior to this year's disclosures of increasing success in attempts to decode
the thing (and the purchase by Microsoft), I was even thinking that I might
have to jump on the bandwagon and start using it, as one of the most
realistic ways of phoning home from various countries overseas.

This new wrinkle in the situation reminds me of the battle royal, many years
ago, between Microsoft and AOL over instant messaging functions.  (Little
good can come out of the fight, I suspect, other than the high probability
that someone will come up with some form of realistic alternative to Skype.)
In the instant messaging scrap, both sides worked furiously on developing
new versions of their client software that would be incompatible with the
other.  This activity culminated in one vendor creating one with a buffer
overflow situation.  Not by accident: this was done deliberately so that
some instant messaging functions could *only* be accessed by a buffer
overflow, thus reducing the (comparative) functionality of the other client.

Not the actions of a vendor that has user security at heart ...

Subject: Re: Cars that drive themselves (Kamens, RISKS-26.47)

[Kamens'] point is valid. However, if we consider the probability of a human
driver hitting a pedestrian, the distribution is probably random (X
incidents per 100K driver/year - dependent on a large variety of
factors). Think of it as wetware fault.

With self-driving car, the control S/W will be the same, or very similar,
across millions of cars so any S/W fault could be expressed by millions of
cars when a given set of input occurs. The distribution of incidences is not
likely to be random but rather predictable.

While formal methods and rigorous testing would reduce the number of
residual bugs, a S/W system like self-driving cars, which is probably very
complex and has millions of LOC, will not be bug free.

Have we exchanged the risk of a random incident, wetware failure, with the
risk of a rare but large scale S/W fault that could cause thousands of
incidents in very short period of time?

an initial Windows installation and an updated one is "the updates" per se.
Some of it is probably uninstall info for those updates, and some System
Restore points providing another method to roll them back.  All of which
would be completely unnecessary if those updates were flawless -- but if
Microsoft had THAT capability, there would never be any need to update
Windows at all!

Memorable flaws include:

* WGA, already noted, multiple versions,

* Repeated delivery and installation of non-functional ATI video drivers
based on Windows Update (or ATI) misidentifying my installed hardware,

* Nightly server reboots caused by an update whose automatic installation
would consistently fail AFTER noting that a reboot would be required (manual
installation mysteriously succeeded).....

In the balance, review a top ten list of Windows worms of recent years to
see how many exploited a vulnerability for which the corrective patch had
been available as an update for at least three months.  How badly do you
prefer being in the Problem Set over being in the Solution Set?
