Subject: Android 13 "Emergency SOS" Implementations Leading to Problems

Apparently an Android OS update from Autumn 2022, offers an "Emergency SOS"
function, whereby, when a particular key combination (one or more keys) is
pressed 5 times, the emergency-services telephone number is called.

Apparently not every manufacturer of Android-based phones has implemented
this function appropriately. There is an article in my local newspaper, the
Neue Westfalische Zeitung, today 2023-06-30, about "ghost calls" causing
problems for the emergency services. The problem is not uniform. In my
district of Bielefeld, with about 334,000 inhabitants, there are about 45
(more) such calls a day, and in May there were about 1,500 more calls than
usual. In the district of Paderborn, just south of us, with about 306,000
inhabitants, there are about 100 (more) such calls a day.

Each such call must be followed. First, the emergency responder calls the
number back. If someone answers, the matter is quickly settled but this
still takes time. If no one answers, the assumption is that the caller is
unable to respond, which can mean a medical emergency with the caller
unconscious; that entails that people and vehicles are sent. There aren't
the personnel to cope with this everywhere all the time.

The problem is apparently known, both by Google and by suppliers of Android
phones. And it can be sorted. The issue then is that not all Android phones
are automatically SW-updated; the users themselves in these cases must
initiate an update and most people don't know about the problem (and some
may not even care :-( ).

Subject: Researchers Find Way to Recover Cryptographic Keys
 by Analyzing LED Flickers (NIST)

In what's an ingenious side-channel attack
<https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/side_channel_attack>, a group of
academics has found that it's possible to recover secret keys from a device
by analyzing video footage of its power LED.

``Cryptographic computations performed by the CPU change the power
consumption of the device which affects the brightness of the device's power
LED,'' researchers from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Cornell
University said <https://www.nassiben.com/video-based-crypta> in a study.

By taking advantage of this observation, it's possible for threat actors to
leverage video camera devices such as an iPhone 13 or an Internet-connected
surveillance camera to extract the cryptographic keys from a smart card
reader.

Specifically, video-based cryptanalysis is accomplished by obtaining video
footage of rapid changes in an LED's brightness and exploiting the video
camera's rolling shutter <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_shutter>
effect to capture the physical emanations.

"This is caused by the fact that the power LED is connected directly to the
power line of the electrical circuit which lacks effective means (e.g.,
filters, voltage stabilizers) of decoupling the correlation with the power
consumption," the researchers said.

In a simulated test <https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/923>, it was found that
the method allowed for the recovery of a 256-bit ECDSA key from a smart
card by analyzing video footage of the power LED flickers via a hijacked
Internet-connected security camera.

 "silencing the alarm" (CNN)

Single points of failure are a risk. Alarms and error messages are a
nuisance. Having only a single set of samples and someone clearing the alarm
without resolving the underlying condition has consequences.

As reported in the CNN article, a lawsuit has been filed by Rensselaer
Polytechnic against a janitorial services contractor concerning a power down
event involving a laboratory freezer.

A laboratory freezer storing biological samples at Rensselaer Polytechnic
was in need of service. Service had been called. Notices were put on the
unit that it was awaiting service and that the unit should not be unplugged,
but the alarm could be temporarily cleared by pressing the TEST button. A
janitor heard the alarms and instead of following the instructions, flipped
the circuit breaker. The temperature went from the programmed -80 C to -32
C, irreparably damaging samples comprising 20 years of research.

Subject: How Do Kwon, a Crypto Fugitive, Upended the Politics
 of Montenegro (*The New York Times*)

Only days before an election in Montenegro, a letter from Do Kwon, the
fugitive founder of the Luna digital coin, claimed that crypto “friends” had
provided campaign funding to a leading candidate.

Already notorious as an agent of market mayhem, the crypto industry has now
unleashed political havoc, too, upending a critical general election in
Montenegro, a troubled Balkan nation struggling to shake off the grip of
organized crime and the influence of Russia.

Only days before a vote on June 11, the political landscape in Montenegro
was thrown into disarray by the intervention of Do Kwon, the fugitive head
of a failed crypto business whose collapse last year contributed to a $2
trillion crash across the industry.

In a handwritten letter sent to the authorities from the Montenegrin jail
where he has been held since March, Mr. Kwon claimed that he had “a very
successful investment relationship” with the leader of the Europe Now
Movement, the election front-runner, and that “friends in the crypto
industry” had provided campaign funding in return for pledges of
“crypto-friendly policies.”

Petro-Canada says the nearly weeklong problems that customers have
experienced with things like payment and loyalty programs at the gas
station chain are ongoing, but it is making progress on solving them.

Problems at the company started about a week ago, when on Friday reports
suggested that parent company Suncor had been hacked. Over the weekend,
Suncor acknowledged it had experienced a "cybersecurity incident" and
stressed that while it was confident that no customer or employee data had
been stolen, "some transactions with customers and suppliers may be
impacted."

Adam Satariano and Kashmir Hill, *The New York Times*, 28 Jun 2023
via ACM TechNews

The use of facial recognition by private businesses is on the rise, with
close to 400 retailers in Britain using Facewatch to alert them to return
visits by shoplifters, problem customers, and legal adversaries. For a
monthly cost starting at =C2=A3250 pounds (US$320), the system allows
retailers to upload images of alleged offenders from security footage,
adding them to a watchlist shared among nearby stores. Facewatch, which
licenses Real Networks and Amazon's facial recognition software, checks
people's biometric information as they walk into the store against a
database of flagged individuals and sends smartphone alerts to retailers if
there is a match. Big Brother Watch's Madeleine Stone said Facewatch is
"normalizing airport-style security checks for everyday activities like
buying a pint of milk."

The European Union has launched four artificial intelligence (AI)
facilities to test and validate the safety of innovations prior to
their market rollout. The virtual and physical sites will offer a
testbed for AI and robotics in real-world manufacturing, healthcare,
agricultural, and urban environments starting next year. The Technical
University of Denmark said the facilities would function as a "safety

complementing public policy. The university described the facilities
as a digital version of Europe's crash test system for new automobiles.

 (NYTimes)

Tiffany Hsu and Steven Lee Myers.*The New York Times*, 25 Jun 2023

Artificial intelligence (AI)-generated political campaign materials designed
to stoke anxiety have spurred demands for safeguards from consultants,
election researchers, and lawmakers. In the run-up to the 2024 presidential
race, the Republican National Committee issued a video with synthetic
dystopian images associated with a Biden victory; the Democrats found
AI-drafted fundraising messages often encouraged more engagement and
donations than human-written copy. Election advocates are urging legislation
to regulate synthetically produced ads, as social media rules and services
that purport to police AI content have fallen short. A group of Democratic
lawmakers has proposed legislation requiring disclaimers to accompany
political ads with AI-generated material, and the American Association of
Political Consultants said using deepfake content in political campaigns
constitutes an ethics code violation.

University of Waterloo (Canada) (06/27/23) via ACM TechNews

Computer scientists at Canada's University of Waterloo have developed an
attack that can bypass voice authentication security systems after six
attempts. They created a program able to remove the markers in deepfake
audio so it is indistinguishable from authentic audio. Although their
success rate against Amazon Connect's voice authentication system ranged
from just 10% in a four-second attack to more than 40% in an attack of less
than 30 seconds, their success rate was 99% after six attempts on
less-sophisticated systems. University of Waterloo's Urs Hengartner said,
"By demonstrating the insecurity of voice authentication, we hope that
companies relying on voice authentication as their only authentication
factor will consider deploying additional or stronger authentication
measures."

"The EU AI Act: A Critical Assessment" [plus my extended comments]

My comments:

Below is referenced an excellent article, and it serves to crystallize
many of my concerns about the current rush toward specific approaches to
AI regulation before the issues are even minimally understood, and why I
am so concerned about negative collateral damage in these kinds of
regulatory efforts.

There is widespread agreement that regulation of AI is necessary, both
from within and outside the industry itself, but as you've probably
grown tired of seeing me write, "the devil is in the details". Poorly
drafted and rushed AI regulation could easily do damage above and beyond
the realistic concerns (that is, the genuine, non-sci-fi concerns) about
AI itself.

It's understandable that the very rapid deployments of AI systems --
particularly generative AI -- are creating escalating anxiety regarding
an array of related real world controversies, an emotion that in many
cases I obviously share.

However, as so often happens when governments and technologies
intersect, the potential for rushed and poorly coordinated actions
severely risks making these situations much worse rather than better,
and that's an outcome to be avoided. Given what's at stake, it's an
outcome to be avoided at all costs.

I don't have any magic wands of course, but in future posts I will
discuss aspects of what I hope are practical paths forward in these
matters. I realize that there is a great deal of concern (and hype)
about these issues, and I welcome your questions. I will endeavor to
answer them as best I can. -L

The Technology Review article mentions "solving CAPTCHAS" as one of the

CAPTCHAS are meant to validate humanness.  We shouldn't be trying to teach AI

Subject: Re: Do chatbot avatars prompt bias in health care?
 (Stein, RISKS-33.73)

The article is about ChatBot **avatars* and not how data is collected. In
any case, training data sets do need to consider the patient demographics
(age, gender, ethnicity/race, etc) in the data.  In the same way, any
well-run clinical trial will need to consider those factors when enrolling
patients into a trial.  This is made more difficult as many diseases and
conditions have different incidences for people of different ages, gender
and ethnicity/race.  Some treatments may be appropriate for younger adult
patients and not for older adult patients (this is somewhat a proxy for
general health).  Children may be treated differently than adults.  None of
the issues are really unique for AI tools, but something that should be
considered when evaluating treatments.  Training of (human) medical
professionals need to be aware of the as well.

For what it is worth, my experience with chat-bots is that at best they are
useful for getting a human to chat with, although some can be worse than
useless and lead you astray (before you actually have to contact a human).

Having read the item about the probability of politicians detecting an
AI-generated email and their ensuing replies (Is America Ready For
AI-Powered Politics?), I have an additional question to that asked by Mr
Stein.

  Q: Did the researchers carry out any kind of analysis to see if the
  replies they received were in turn written by a Large Language Model,
  Chat-GPT or something similar?

What is sauce for the goose will probably soon (if not already) become sauce
for the gander.

And a supplementary question: How long before we have a large body of
correspondence with no human involvement or oversight of any sort? That
brings a new risk; real correspondence gets overlooked as it's lost in the
'chatter'. I'm sure the readership of this list can think of other related
risks.
