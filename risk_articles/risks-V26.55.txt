Subject: Hurricane power outage: What could possibly go wrong?

"When power went out at Johnson Memorial Hospital in Stafford Springs [due
to the hurricane, on 27 Aug 2011], the hospital switched to its backup
generator.  But then they lost the generator as well.  A spokesperson says
after discussions with the power company, they decided to transfer patients
to other hospitals, starting with critical care patients."
http://connecticut.cbslocal.com/2011/08/28/hospital-patients-transferred-after-storm-cuts-power/

Imagine the fun and RISKS.

How well do computerized patient records, computerized billing systems,
computerized medication systems, card access systems, etc. work in this
situation?  This seems highly prone to failure even if the transition
happened on a planned basis, much less suddenly.  It's rather scary how many
different possible failure modes come to mind with only a few seconds of
thought, much less a detailed study.

I would have thought that generator testing would be one of the first things
on the "to do" list as soon as they suspected Irene would affect their area
(in addition to more regularly scheduled testing).  It would be interesting
to see what the root cause of the generator failure was.

Black Hat: Insulin pumps can be hacked, 10 Aug 2011
<http://www.scmagazineus.com/black-hat-insulin-pumps-can-be-hacked/article/209106/>

A Type 1 diabetic said Thursday that hackers can remotely change his insulin
pump to levels that could kill him.  Jay Radcliffe, a security researcher,
demonstrated to the crowd at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas how he is
able to send commands to and wirelessly disable (within about 150 feet) the
insulin pump he has been wearing since he was 22, when he was diagnosed with
the autoimmune disease after dealing with extreme weight loss and an
unquenchable thirst.

Radcliffe, now 33, explained that all he requires to perpetrate the hack is
the target pump's serial number, which can be obtained via social
engineering or by running a simple computer scan. Then using hardware and a
program he wrote to talk to the device, he can issue instructions. These
commands can order the device to turn off, but more dangerously, they can
significantly raise or lower the levels of insulin Radcliffe's body absorbs
at any given moment.

"It's basically like having root on the device, which is like having root on
the chemistry of your body," said Radcliffe, who wears his $6,000 pump
around the clock to maintain normal blood sugar levels.  Radcliffe did not
name the affected vendor because the threat requires a complete overhaul of
the product and would result in panicked customers.  "I don't think it's
relevant to the purpose of my talk," he said at a press conference
afterward. "If I name the vendor, then any bad guy or evil hacker...can
start exploit code on it right away."

Radcliffe said he isn't sure how many other vendors make insulin pumps that
suffer from similar vulnerabilities. To remedy the problem, he suggested
manufacturers implement a verification process, in which users have to
approve changes to their devices.

In addition, the pumps should contain a password-protected serial number.
The vulnerability is more indicative, he said, of the chronic insecurity of
embedded systems.  "Everything has an embedded processor and computer in
it," he said. "Every time you hide behind [security by] obscurity, it is
going to fail."

Brad Smith, a researcher and Black Hat conference staffer who also is a
registered nurse, said the medical field largely looks the other way when it
comes to securing patient devices.  "I lecture at all the medical
conferences," he said during the press conference. "They just hide it. Pay
attention to what [Radcliffe] is saying.  His life is in this pump."

Subject: One Sperm Donor, 150 Offspring (Jacqueline Mroz)

Jacqueline Mroz, *The New York Times*, 5 Sep 2011

Cynthia Daily and her partner used a sperm donor to conceive a baby seven
years ago, and they hoped that one day their son would get to know some of
his half siblings - an extended family of sorts for modern times.  So
Ms. Daily searched a Web-based registry for other children fathered by the
same donor and helped to create an online group to track them. Over the
years, she watched the number of children in her son's group grow.  And
grow.

Today there are 150 children, all conceived with sperm from one donor, in
this group of half siblings, and more are on the way. "It's wild when we see
them all together - they all look alike," said Ms.  Daily, 48, a social
worker in the Washington area who sometimes vacations with other families in
her son's group.

As more women choose to have babies on their own, and the number of children
born through artificial insemination increases, outsize groups of donor
siblings are starting to appear. While Ms. Daily's group is among the
largest, many others comprising 50 or more half siblings are cropping up on
Web sites and in chat groups, where sperm donors are tagged with unique
identifying numbers.

Now, there is growing concern among parents, donors and medical experts
about potential negative consequences of having so many children fathered by
the same donors, including the possibility that genes for rare diseases
could be spread more widely through the population. Some experts are even
calling attention to the increased odds of accidental incest between half
sisters and half brothers, who often live close to one another. ...

Ten Years After 9/11, Cyber Attacks Pose National Threat, Committee Says
  [Excerpted from ACM TechNews; Friday, 9 Sep 2011]

Catastrophic cyberattacks are a very real threat to U.S. security, according
to a study from the Bipartisan Policy Center's National Security
Preparedness Group (NSPG).  The study underscores worries from the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence community about
terrorists striking against U.S. assets without ever penetrating national
borders, with the threat against critical infrastructure systems being
especially potent.  "As the current crisis in Japan demonstrates, disruption
of power grids and basic infrastructure can have devastating effects on
society," the report says.  The NSPG report acknowledges that the
U.S. government has made significant strides in meeting many of the 9/11
Commission's recommendations, but notes that progress has been slow in
several key areas.  For example, the availability of radio spectrum for
public safety purposes still needs to be substantially broadened, while a
recommendation to establish a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board
with the federal government's executive branch is still not completely
implemented.  "If we were issuing grades, the implementation of this
recommendation would receive a failing mark," the report concludes.

  Nominet UK proposing police shut down domains without court order
  http://j.mp/nFs4z5 (eWeek Europe) [ NNSquad]

  "Nominet, the registrar that handles .uk domains, is moving ahead with
  proposed rules (PDF) that could allow law enforcement agencies to request
  a domain be shut down without a court order."

Go ahead, keeping pushing the evolution of non-centralized DNS alternatives
not subject to extrajudicial tampering. The more governments interfere with
DNS operations, the more clear it is to everyone that DNS has outlived its
usefulness.

The real irony is that increasingly entities who feel vulnerable to
government DNS takedowns are taking preemptive steps for alternatives to
maintain connectivity. So governments really are unwittingly helping
"Darwin" in this area.

During the evening of 10 Sept 2011, Channel 5's second digital channel had a
windows Internet browser information window overwriting the weather
information for at least 30 minutes.  (I gave up checking.)
[Attached .jpg omitted.  You've probably seen something like it before. PGN.]

This is yet another example of how attempting to run systems without
operational access and monitoring shows the seams where unmonitored
automation fails.  I had to laugh at the Internet Explorer window, but I
also imagined home viewers attempting to call the station and provide
information to the single employee trying to keep the evening television
shows running.

Subject: Risks of typos in email addresses: Man-in-the-mailbox attack

In a paper titled "Doppelganger Domains", Garrett Gee and Peter Kim describe
how by registering domains that match someone else's subdomain, less a dot
or two, such as "cslsri.com" (for csl.sri.com), someone can capture email
which has a typo in the address.
http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2011/09/Doppelganger.Domains.pdf

By forwarding the mail (and the reply) to the appropriate real address(es),
the capturer can cover his tracks, meanwhile collecting whatever valuable
information (passwords, business secrets, etc) is contained in the emails.

The authors also describe some defensive measures domain owners can take.

              Why Governments Are Terrified of Social Media
         http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000891.html  [NNSquad}

In Missouri, teachers and others are up in arms over a law that would ban
most contacts between teachers and students through social media, not only
via systems like Facebook, but even apparently mechanisms such as Google
Docs ( http://j.mp/pSqX11 [ABC News] ).

In the UK, Prime Minister David Cameron has proposed censoring or cutting
off BlackBerry and other social media systems based on the misguided and
false assumption that this would prevent planning and communications by
potential rioters or other "undesirable" persons.

And back here in the U.S., BART shut down parts of the cell phone network,
in an attempt to block communications in advance of a legal protest that
never took place, though we know full well from history that protests --
even of enormous scope -- do not require high technology to be organized and
deployed ( http://j.mp/rq7SO9 [Lauren's Blog] ).

Around the world, including here in the U.S., governments are demanding
unencrypted access to supposedly "secure" communications systems.

The common thread is very clear.  Governments are increasingly terrified of
the communications abilities that Internet and other technologies have
provided their citizenry and other residents.

While usually careful to express their concerns in the context of seemingly
laudable motives like fighting crime or terrorism, in reality these
governments have revealed the distrust and contempt with which they view
their populations at large.

This is by no means a new phenomenon.

Throughout human history, governments and many leaders have cast a jaundiced
eye on virtually every new technological development that enabled
communications, particularly if that technology made it easier for direct
person-to-person messages to be exchanged outside the view of government
services and minders.

These government efforts to suppress and control communications have
virtually all failed in the end, though a great deal of damage has been done
to individuals and groups in the process.

At one time, even the ability to read and write was considered too dangerous
a skill set for the commoners.  The invention of the printing press threw
government and churches alike into convulsions of apprehension.

And now "social media" is the new scapegoat, the whipping boy, the
technological designated evil that short-sighted politicians of both major
parties, and their various administrative minions and supporters, are
demanding be monitored, leashed, and controlled.

In reality of course, it's not the technology that these persons wish to
leash -- it's ordinary people.  It's you and me and the vastness of other
law-abiding persons who have become the targets of the 21st century law
enforcement mantra: "Screw the Bill of Rights -- treat everybody like a
suspect, all the time."

The broad implications of this "guilty until proven innocent" mindset are
all around us now.  They're at the heart of the newly revealed alliance
between CIA and the New York Police Department to monitor the activities of
innocent citizens, using surveillance techniques that would have seemed
comfortably familiar to the old East German Stasi secret police.

They're seen in the massive government-mandated Internet data retention
demanded by "The Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of
2011" -- now moving rapidly through Congress, and disingenuously titled to
suggest it only applies to child abuse, when in reality its true reach would
broadly encompass all manner of Internet access activities (
http://j.mp/o13jMO [Atlantic] ).

Governments seem to increasingly no longer feel that it's necessary or
desirable to have "probable cause" or court orders before spying on
individuals, tracking their movements via hidden GPS units, building
dossiers, or even disrupting communications.  Constitutional guarantees are
more and more viewed by our leaders as quaint artifacts of the past, to be
ignored today merely as annoying inconveniences.

The innocent are now being treated largely as potential "future criminals"
-- and so subject to many of the same sorts of surveillance and other law
enforcement techniques that in the past were generally limited to specific
suspects of specific crimes.

To the extent that these activities for now appear to be mostly aimed at
persons with skin colors or religions different from us, it becomes easier
to "go with the flow" of this new law enforcement mentality, to not make
waves, to be quiet, to be sheep.

But the same techniques used today against one group can be easily
repurposed for others.  Government ordered records of users' Internet
activities will affect us all, and the infrastructures created to support
these surveillance-related systems may be be extremely long-lived.

When governments no longer trust the people, when officials make the mental
and physical leaps to targeting vast numbers of innocent persons in the
manner of criminal suspects of yesteryear, we have embarked on a road that
leads to a very dark place indeed.

Today, social media is the cross-hairs.  Governments certainly are
enthusiastic about using social media for their own investigatory and
enforcement purposes, but they appear to be desperately seeking ways to
control and limit the ability of ordinary persons to communicate privately
and securely on these systems, or to use them at all in some cases.

This is hypocrisy of the highest order.  It is a serious risk to innocent
individuals being targeted by its adherents today.

Unchallenged, tomorrow it will be a serious risk to us all.

Jeff James, Private Yale Student Info Accessible via Google Search
25 Aug 2011

While we're normally flooded with news about hackers who routinely bypass
security systems and exploit zero-day vulnerabilities to gain access to
sensitive systems, recent news from Yale University underscores that the
vast majority of IT security failures are caused by human error, neglect, or
plain ignorance. I've written about how users are often the weakest link in
IT security, but that maxim can apply to simple human error in general.

According to the Yale student newspaper, the University is notifying 43,000
staff, students, and alumni that sensitive personal information -- like
names and social security numbers -- were inadvertently made accessible to
Internet searches when a file containing that information was left
unprotected and unsecured on an FTP server that was used as a storage
location for open source software. ...

Yale Student Allows His Privacy To Be Obliterated For A Class Project
Kashmir Hill, *Forbes*, 12 May 2011

Six Yale students needed a guinea pig for a class project. The guinea pig
had to be willing to hand over access to his cellphone and to his Facebook
and email accounts so that the students could figure out which of the three
held the most revealing and intimate details about a person's life.

Amazingly, they found a volunteer. And now the details of his life have been
posted online for your perusal. The Yalies called it "The Gavin Project."
They wanted to find out "which source of personal information reveals the
most personal information." One nod to privacy: "Gavin" is not the Yale
senior's real name. So what did they find out about him?

His smartphone revealed he's well-connected, yielding some interesting
contacts, including former New York governor Elliot Spitzer, Reddit founder
Alexis Ohanian, blogger Matt Yglesias, and former Mexican president Ernesto
Zedillo. Given that social circle, I wasn't surprised when one of the
students involved in the data scrape, Sebastian Park, told me Gavin has
political ambitions. (So perhaps his fellow privacy-invading students were
doing him a favor.  Lots of politicians these days are paying "online
reputation companies" to go through their digital dossiers to find potential
landmines, reports Politico.)  ...

Subject: Yet another incident of over-reliance on GPS navigation

Vermont State Police say a Massachusetts woman drove her car into a river
from a road that had been damaged by flooding from Tropical Storm Irene
after she drove around a road closed sign while following directions from
her GPS, according to the Associated Press.

Police say 25-year-old Sarah Ho of Boston was driving on the Dover Road in
South Newfane late Saturday afternoon when she came upon a road closed
sign. She told police she drove around the sign after seeing other vehicles
drive around the sign.

Police say Ho was driving too fast when she came upon a one-lane section of
gravel road with large potholes. As a result her car went into the adjacent
river.  She was not hurt and her vehicle suffered minor damage.

'Zombie cookies' won't die: Microsoft admits use, HTML5 looms as new vector
Despite lawsuits, bad publicity, and Adobe's promise to end their use
in Flash, zombie cookies persist and could find a new host in HTML5
By Woody Leonhard | InfoWorld

opening paragraphs:

One year ago this week, I wrote about zombie cookies, describing how Disney,
MySpace, and NBC Universal had just been sued for using zombie cookies to
track people even if they have gone to great lengths to disable, block, or
delete cookies. Seven months ago, I mentioned that Adobe had taken up the
pitchfork and vowed to make Flash zombie cookies a thing of the past.

So it's pretty shocking that Jonathan Mayer, a Stanford researcher, caught
Microsoft using both a cache-based zombie cookie and a more advanced type of
persistent "supercookie" to track folks even if they blocked or deleted
browser cookies. Microsoft surreptitiously tracked users who had the
temerity to visit MSN.com (in the United States, Canada, and Spain), the
U.S. English home page of www.microsoft.com, or the Microsoft Store.

Perhaps even scarier, as HTML5 gains traction: Its local storage is a great
feature, but one wide open for abuse for such items as zombie cookies. And
Internet Explorer's InPrivate Browsing, Firefox's Private Browsing, and
Chrome's Incognito browsing modes won't protect you from the ETag form of
zombie cookies or from HTML5-based zombies.

The kitchen in the rooming house where I live has a gas stove and microwave
oven, both having clocks.  Usually they are right but occasionally if PEPCO
has had a power failure of a second or longer, then both will reset, and if
someone puts the wrong time in either then there's no guarantee they'll be
right.

Which is why when I want the exact time, I depend upon the $7 battery-

once every six months, basically each time Daylight Savings Time either
starts or ends.  Much more accurate and reliable, and absolutely immune to

Subject: Abridged info on RISKS (comp.risks)

 The ACM RISKS Forum is a MODERATED digest. Its Usenet manifestation is
 comp.risks, the feed for which is donated by panix.com as of June 2011.
=> SUBSCRIPTIONS: PLEASE read RISKS as a newsgroup (comp.risks or equivalent)
 if possible and convenient for you.  The mailman Web interface can
 be used directly to subscribe and unsubscribe:
   http://lists.csl.sri.com/mailman/listinfo/risks
 Alternatively, to subscribe or unsubscribe via e-mail to mailman
 your FROM: address, send a message to
   risks-request@csl.sri.com
 containing only the one-word text subscribe or unsubscribe.  You may
 also specify a different receiving address: subscribe address= ... .
 You may short-circuit that process by sending directly to either
   risks-subscribe@csl.sri.com or risks-unsubscribe@csl.sri.com
 depending on which action is to be taken.

 Subscription and unsubscription requests require that you reply to a
 confirmation message sent to the subscribing mail address.  Instructions
 are included in the confirmation message.  Each issue of RISKS that you
 receive contains information on how to post, unsubscribe, etc.

=> The complete INFO file (submissions, default disclaimers, archive sites,
 copyright policy, etc.) is online.
   <http://www.CSL.sri.com/risksinfo.html>
 The full info file may appear now and then in RISKS issues.
 *** Contributors are assumed to have read the full info file for guidelines.

=> .UK users may contact <Lindsay.Marshall@newcastle.ac.uk>.
=> SPAM challenge-responses will not be honored.  Instead, use an alternative
 address from which you NEVER send mail!
=> SUBMISSIONS: to risks@CSL.sri.com with meaningful SUBJECT: line.
 *** NOTE: Including the string "notsp" at the beginning or end of the subject
 *** line will be very helpful in separating real contributions from spam.
