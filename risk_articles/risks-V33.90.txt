When radiologist Domenico Mastrodicasa finds himself stuck while writing a
research paper, he turns to ChatGPT, the chatbot that produces fluent
responses to almost any query in seconds. “I use it as a sounding board,”
says Mastrodicasa, who is based at the University of Washington School of
Medicine in Seattle. “I can produce a publication-ready manuscript much
faster.”

  [I am reminded of Fred Brooks and Bill Wright doing a Markov chain
  analysis of 37 common-meter hymn tunes, and Al Hopkins and I a year later
  in Tony Oettinger's statistical linguistics seminar (1954-1955) randomly
  generating more than 600 hymn tunes consistent with various chain lengths
  in weekend runs on the Harvard Mark IV.  This is documented in our paper,
  An Experiment in Musical Composition, IRE Transactions on Electronic
  Computers EC-6, 175-182, September 1957.  You can find it on the Web.

  Harvard Poet David McCord wrote these common-meter lyrics, which he read
  at the introduction of a Univac 1 (taking literary liberty with the
  identity of the computer):

    O God, our help in ages past,
    Thy help we now eschew.
    Hymn tunes on Univac at last,
    Dear God, for Thee, for You.
    We turn them out almighty fast,

    Ten books to every pew.

  Our HymnBot almost 70 years ago was obviously a very primitive

Could ‘algorithmic destruction’ solve AI’s copyright issues?

OpenAI’s ChatGPT is trained by “consuming” vast amounts of information

their copyrighted works to teach its chatbots how to respond to written
prompts. One way to fix that could be to employ “algorithmic destruction.”

Richard Drew/Associated Press

If artificial intelligence mimics our brains, does that mean it too can
unlearn something it knows?

That question is central to lawsuits filed by a range of creatives who say
their copyrighted work was infringed by OpenAI and Meta. But making an AI
“forget” isn’t the same as removing the blocky chips from HAL 9000’s digital
brain in “2001: A Space Odyssey.” In fact, the lawsuits raise the question:
is “unlearning” even possible for an AI? And, if not, are there other ways
to ensure generative AI programs don’t draw from copyrighted material, short
of tearing them down?

Enter “algorithmic destruction,” a term that entails trashing an AI model
that may have taken years and millions of dollars to train, then rebuilding
it from scratch by inputting only fair-use text, images and data.

That would be “the most extreme remedy” to issues highlighted in lawsuits
like those filed against OpenAI and Meta, said Pamela Samuelson, a UC
Berkeley professor and expert in generative AI and copyright law.

But, she said, it’s not unthinkable.

Here’s how it might work:

Since AI models aren't some baby powder that can be easily recalled and
remade after slapping a company with a fine, there are basically three
approaches given the current way the technology works, plus one more path
that would change how it “thinks,” said UC Berkeley professor and computer
scientist Matei Zaharia:

  Destroy the model.
  “Screen” results that include copyrighted material.
  Retrain the model.

A fourth route would be to invent models that work more like a super-smart
web search, and which can cite sources unlike chatbots such as GPT-3 which,
similar to a human brain, doesn't always know where it learned something, or
whether it’s totally accurate.

That way programmers could, in theory, pull documents from a model’s
training set — like nodes of the HAL 9000’s processor — so the program could
no longer reference them when asked a question, said Zaharia, who is working
on that kind of approach.

With the way the dominant generative AI technology works for now, though,
“it’s hard to make models forget specific content,” said Zaharia, who is
also the co-founder and CTO of San Francisco’s Databricks.

The easiest way to keep a program from spitting out information it shouldn’t
“would probably be after your model generates something, but before you send
it back to the user, you check, ‘Is this really close to something’ ” like a
copyrighted work, Zaharia said.

Telling the program to skate around copyrighted material, specifically,
would probably not work since, like a toddler with superpowers, “it doesn't
really know” what is copyrighted and what isn’t, Zaharia said.

Subject: A Chatbot Encouraged Him to Kill the Queen.  It's Just the
 Beginning (WiReD)

Companies are designing AI to appear increasingly human. That can mislead
users—or worse.

Humans are prone to see two dots and a line and think they’re a face.  When
they do it to chatbots, it’s known as the Eliza effect. The name comes from
the first chatbot, Eliza, developed by MIT scientist Joseph Weizenbaum in
1966. Weizenbaum noticed users were ascribing erroneous insights to a text
generator simulating a therapist.  [...]

Mental health chatbots may carry similar risks. Jodi Halpern, a professor of
bioethics at UC Berkeley, whose work has challenged the idea of using AI
chatbots to help meet the rising demand for mental health care, has become
increasingly concerned by a marketing push to sell these apps as caring
companions. She's worried that patients are being encouraged to develop
dependent relationships—of “trust, intimacy, and vulnerability”—with an
app. This is a form of manipulation, Halpern says. And should the app fail
the user, there is often no mental health professional ready to come to
their aid. Artificial intelligence cannot stand in for human empathy, she
says.

Subject: Dilemma of the Artificial Intelligence Regulatory Landscape
 (CACM Vol 66 No 9)

In the opinion piece "Dilemma of the Artificial Intelligence Regulatory
Landscape": Wu and Liu note that with rapid expansion of LLMs and progress
towards true AI regulatory frameworks are woefully unprepared. The authors
are of the opinion that implementation of new features should be accelerated
regardless of the regulatory gaps stating ``We have found the key to
settling concerns is to clearly convey the message that potential benefits
outweigh relevant risks.''  This is an extremely troubling approach that led
to terrible things like the ozone hole over Antarctica, and one that I would
caution strongly against. Doubly so, considering that LLMs are regularly
demonstrating they provide at least as many risks as benefits, if not more
so. Copyright lawsuits, Intellectual Property disputes and even a case of
Libel have all appeared in relation to LLMs. In summation, I disagree.

Facial recognition software is speeding up check-in at airports, cruise
ships and theme parks, but experts worry about risks to security and
privacy.

Facial recognition technology will increasingly offer travelers shorter
lines and fewer documents to juggle, but all that convenience may have a
cost, warned Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil
Liberties Union. By accepting more surveillance technology, he said, “we
open ourselves to tracking where we are and who we are with all the time.”

Subject: A big win in our fight to reclaim the Internet!

The so-called *impossible* has happened! It was widely believed that
YouTube was too big and too powerful to change its behaviour in
response to public pressure. But we didn't accept that.

Following years of campaigning, research, and policy advocacy by
Mozilla, YouTube has announced it will share data with
researchers. This change, as pd art of the platform's required
compliance of the European Union's Digital Services Act, will provide
independent researchers with critical public data -- data that will
allow the outside world to better understand how to stop YouTube from
recommending dangerous and harmful content.

This victory belongs to hundreds of thousands of Mozilla supporters --
to the people who: Donated their data to RegretsReporter, our browser
extension that helped aggregate YouTube recommendations for
researchers and that has been influential in shaping the EU's Digital
Services Act (DSA) regulation; Shared their stories of how their lives
and well-being had been impacted by YouTube's recommendations; and
Signed petitions and chipped in to support multiple fronts of our
campaigning work that made this victory possible.

It's a result of long-term movement building work -- the exact type of
work that is made possible by the continued support of Mozilla
supporters.  And it's a result of our work with dozens of
organisations that supported our recommendations for public data
sharing under the DSA. And wins like these prove that together, the
Mozilla community is capable of taking on globally dominant platforms
like YouTube -- and winning.  [...]

ChatGPT's latest job is to be mom and dad's brilliant sidekick. Parents of
kids of all ages are using the chatbot to help raise their children.

Why it matters: The tool has the potential to ease the burden on burned-out,
over-scheduled parents.
<https://www.axios.com/2022/05/31/parents-schools-uvalde-baby-formula-race>=
But it's no replacement for a human's judgment -- especially regarding

What's happening: ChatGPT excels at brainstorming and researching -- both
functions that can be uniquely useful to parents, says Celia Quillian, a
product marketer in Atlanta who runs a TikTok account advising followers on
creative ways to use the robot.

   - The chatbot could plan an 8-year-old's mermaid-themed birthday party in
   seconds, offering drink ideas like mermaid fruit punch -- blue= Gatorade

  - It can conjure up a chore chart for a group of young siblings, tailoring
   the tasks so they're appropriate for each age. For example, a 7-year-old
   might start with picking up toys, while their 13-year-old sibling vacuums
   the living room.

   - It can even answer age-old questions that kids ask exasperated
   parents. Think, "Why is the sky blue?" The chatbot will feed you an
   answer fit for a 4-year-old.

Subject: Allied Spy Chiefs Warn of Chinese Espionage Targeting Tech Firms
 (NYTimes)

The United States and its allies vowed this week to do more to counter
Chinese theft of technology, warning at an unusual gathering of
intelligence leaders that Beijing’s espionage is increasingly trained not
on the hulking federal buildings of Washington but the shiny office
complexes of Silicon Valley.

The intelligence chiefs sought to engage private industry in combating what
one official called an *unprecedented threat* on Tuesday as they discussed
how to better protect new technologies and help Western countries keep
their edge over China.

The choice of meeting venue -— Stanford University, in Silicon Valley —- was
strategic. While Washington is often considered the key espionage
battleground in the United States, FBI officials estimate that more than
half of Chinese espionage focused on stealing American technology takes
place in the Bay Area.

It was the first time the heads of the FBI and Britain's MI5 and their
counterparts from Australia, Canada and New Zealand had gathered for a
public discussion of intelligence threats. It was, in effect, a summit of
the spy hunters, the counterintelligence agencies whose job it is to detect
and stop efforts by China to steal allied secrets.

“That unprecedented meeting is because we are dealing with another
unprecedented threat,” said Christopher A. Wray, the FBI director.  “There
is no greater threat to innovation than the Chinese government.”

 (WiReD)

German startup Vay is pushing teledriving -- in which cars are remotely
operated by humans -- as easier to achieve than fully autonomous driving.

On the busy streets of suburban Berlin, just south of Tempelhofer Feld, a
white Kia is skillfully navigating double-parked cars, roadworks, cyclists,
and pedestrians. Dan, the driver, strikes up a conversation with his
passengers, remarking on the changing traffic lights and the sound of an
ambulance screaming past in the other direction. But Dan isn’t in the car.

Instead, he’s half a mile away at the offices of German startup Vay. The
company kits its cars out with radar, GPS, ultrasound, and an array of other
sensors to allow drivers like Dan to control the vehicles remotely from a
purpose-built station equipped with a driver’s seat, steering wheel, pedals,
and three monitors providing visibility in front of the car and to its side.

  "Therefore, to assert that naturalistic evolution is true also asserts

  naturalism is self-defeating."

The main flaw of Patinga's argument is of course that naturalistic evolution

Using what for backhaul?  Every cableco I know forbids reselling your

Also, femtocells have very limited power and are only supposed to be used
indoors because they can interfere with real cell towers. The real towers
are designed by engineers and have licenses so they provide useful coverage
and manage interference between cells.
