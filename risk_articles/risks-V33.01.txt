"In a letter, top executives at Boeing and Airbus warned that the technology

"Concerns have previously been raised that C-Band spectrum 5G wireless could

The C-Band spectrum encompasses 4-8GHz.

FAA airworthiness directives identify radio altimeters operating between
3.7-3.98 GHz encounter 5G interference that renders the instruments
unreliable at certain airports.

Subject: Tesla test drivers believe they're on a mission to make driving
 safer for everyone. Skeptics say they're a safety hazard. (WashPost)

Skeptics say they're a safety hazard. Tesla test drivers said they are
willing to take on the risk even if they have to intervene -- believing they
are on a world-changing mission.

The Post interviewed a half-dozen of the beta testers who paid as much as
$10,000 for the ability to upgrade their cars with the software. All
self-described fans of Tesla, the testers were all awed by what the software
can do, but well aware of its limitations and the risks involved. Some beta
testers have found the software too inconsistent and harrowing to use and
faulted Tesla for releasing it too early.

``In the beginning when I heard it was going to be pushed out to the public
I was like, Uh-oh, not good,'' an engineer, who had early access to the Full
Self-Driving beta and spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing
retaliation from the company. He recalls thinking: ``It's not ready to be
put into the hands of the public.''  [...]

``It's a gamble that may pay off; if there are few serious incidents
involving drivers, passengers, other road users [etc.], consumer opinion
continues to support the company, and Tesla stays ahead of the regulators, I
can see a point where the safety and utility of FSD far outstrips concerns.''

But drivers say their experience shows that day is far off. Some were
startled one day in October when Tesla vehicles started behaving erratically
after receiving a software update overnight. The cars began abruptly braking
at highway speeds, which Tesla said came after false triggers of the
forward-collision warning and automatic emergency braking systems prompted
by a software update.

The company later issued a recall, and owners -- including Smith -- said
they were dismayed by its actions related to the move.

 Open (Reuters)

Emma Farge, *Reuters*, 13 Dec 2021, via ACM TechNews, 17 Dec 2021

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a new call for regulation of
lethal autonomous weapons (LAWS) at the Convention on Certain Conventional
Weapons this week in Geneva, Switzerland. LAWS are fully machine-controlled
and use technology like artificial intelligence and facial recognition;
regulatory urgency has escalated since a U.N. panel reported in March that
the first autonomous drone attack may have already transpired in Libya. Some
states participating in the talks support a total ban of LAWS, while others,
like the U.S., think such weapons can be used to hit targets more precisely
than humans. A diplomat involved in the talks said while there is
insufficient support to launch a treaty right now, but "We think some
principles could be agreed for national implementation."

Subject: Russia fines Google $100 million, and Facebook parent company $27
 million, for content violations (WashPost)

A Russian court fined Google nearly $100 million Friday for “systematic
failure to remove banned content” — the largest such penalty yet in the
country as Moscow attempts to rein in Western tech giants.

The fine was calculated based on Google's annual revenue, the court said.
Roskomnadzor, Russia's Internet regulator, told the court that Google's 2020
turnover in the country exceeded 85 billion rubles, or about $1.15 billion.

Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, was fined
approximately $27 million, also for declining to remove banned content,
several hours after the Google decision. Meta's fine, like the one levied on
Google, was tied to yearly revenue in Russia.

The fines represent an escalation in Russia's push to pressure foreign tech
firms to comply with its increasingly strict rules on what it deems illegal
content -- particularly apps, websites, posts and videos related to jailed
opposition leader Alexei Navalny's network, which has been labeled as
extremist in the country.

Established satellite operators expressed their frustration at the wave of
filings for enormous satellite constellations, arguing nations need to step
forward and establish rules to curtail such systems.

The best known of such filings is one by the government of Rwanda with the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in September, which proposed
two constellations with a combined 327,230 satellites. Rwanda has launched
to date a single satellite, a three-unit cubesat called RwaSat-1 in 2019.

Companies have also made filings for large constellations. Kepler, the
Canadian company developing a relatively modest satellite constellation,
filed through the German government a proposed system called Aether with
nearly 115,000 satellites. The company said Nov. 18 that the figure includes
all satellites with an Aether terminal installed, not just the company's own
satellites, but the total is far larger than all operational satellites in
orbit today.  [...]

Subject: New Mobile Network Vulnerabilities Affect All Cellular Generations
 Since 2G (The Hacker News)

Researchers have disclosed security vulnerabilities in handover, a
fundamental mechanism that undergirds modern cellular networks, which could
be exploited by adversaries to launch denial-of-service (DoS) and
man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks using low-cost equipment.

The "vulnerabilities in the handover procedure are not limited to one
handover case only but they impact all different handover cases and
scenarios that are based on unverified measurement reports and signal
strength thresholds," researchers Evangelos Bitsikas and Christina Pöpper
from the New York University Abu Dhabi said in a *new paper*
<https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485832.3485914>. "The problem affects all
generations since 2G (GSM), remaining unsolved so far."

Handover <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handover>, also known as handoff, is
a process in telecommunications in which a phone call or a data session is
transferred from one cell site <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_site>
(aka base station) to another cell tower without losing connectivity during
the transmission. This method is crucial to establishing cellular
communications, especially in scenarios when the user is on the move.

The routine typically works as follows: the user equipment (UE
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_equipment>) sends signal strength
measurements to the network to determine if a handover is necessary and, if
so, facilitates the switch when a more suitable target station is
discovered.

While these signal readings are cryptographically protected, the content in
these reports is themselves not verified, thus allowing an attacker to force
the device to move to a cell site operated by the attacker. The crux of the
attack lies in the fact that the source base station is incapable of
handling incorrect values in the measurement report, raising the possibility
of a malicious handover without being detected.  [...]

Subject: Bugs in billions of WiFi, Bluetooth chips allow password/data theft
 (BleepingComputer)

Researchers at the University of Darmstadt, Brescia, CNIT, and the Secure
Mobile Networking Lab, have published a paper that proves it's possible to
extract passwords and manipulate traffic on a WiFi chip by targeting a
device's Bluetooth component.

Modern consumer electronic devices such as smartphones feature SoCs with
separate Bluetooth, WiFi, and LTE components, each with its own dedicated
security implementation.  However, these components often share the same
resources, such as the antenna or wireless spectrum.  This resource sharing
aims to make the SoCs more energy-efficient and give them higher throughput
and low latency in communications.

As the researchers detail in the recently published paper, it is possible to
use these shared resources as bridges for launching lateral privilege
escalation attacks across wireless chip boundaries.

The implications of these attacks include code execution, memory readout,
and denial of service,

An unexplained switch to a new login system forces customers to redo login

The short notice and unforgiving rules could invite speculation about a data
breach or a foolish adherence to password-expiration dogma that experts
dumped years ago. But JetBlue said Wednesday that it's a result of a
previous IT migration.

``In 2020, JetBlue updated our cybersecurity account management tools with a
more secure log-in provider and, with that, updated to a new password policy
for customers creating accounts or resetting passwords,'' spokesman Philip
Stewart told PCMag.  ``While the system change that added this new
authentication provider was completed in 2020, we phased in forcing password
updates in order to limit the impact to traveling customers.''

This new regime doesn't seem to allow for older passwords that comply
with the new rules. A 15-character JetBlue password that predated 2020

But the real problem isn't the increase in complexity, it's the lack of
explanation -- poor electronic etiquette shared by way too many companies
that leave their customers to catch up with their infosec updates.

The Australian road rules say it is OK to make and receive audio phone
calls, or to use the phone as a music player or as a user interface for
driver-assist functions such as navigation, etc, (including touching the
screen if necessary) so long as the phone is securely attached to the
vehicle in a proper commercially designed phone holder.  You are also
allowed to use the phone to make and receive audio calls so long as it is
truly "hands-free" (i.e., no touching the phone).  You can't use the phone
at all when "hand-held", you can't type or display text messages, and you
can't display video on the phone for entertainment purposes.

So no, it is not illegal to use the cell-phone for navigation purposes -- a
