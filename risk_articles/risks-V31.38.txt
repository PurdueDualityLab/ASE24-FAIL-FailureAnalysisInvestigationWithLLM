Subject: 16 Million Americans Will Vote on Hackable Paperless Machines
  (MIT TechReview)

Patrick Howell O'Neill, Technology Review, 13 Aug 2019 via
ACM TechNews, Wednesday, August 21, 2019

A study by researchers at New York University found that at least 16 million
Americans in eight states will vote on completely paperless machines in the
2020 U.S. elections, despite a strong consensus among cyberosecurity and
national security experts that paper ballots and vote audits are necessary
to ensure election security. While the states in question are not
historically battleground states, some are likely to be more closely
contested than usual. Said U.S. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, "Congress needs
to set mandatory federal election security standards that outlaw paperless
voting machines and guarantee every American the right to vote with a
hand-marked paper ballot." Wyden cited experts as requiring hand-marked
paper ballots and post-election audits to defend against hacking. "Vendors
should recognize that fact or get out of the way."

Subject: Moscow's blockchain voting system cracked a month before election
  (ZDNet)

A French security researcher has found a critical vulnerability in the
blockchain-based voting system Russian officials plan to use next month for
the 2019 Moscow City Duma election.

Pierrick Gaudry, an academic at Lorraine University and a researcher for
INRIA, the French research institute for digital sciences, found that he
could compute the voting system's private keys based on its public
keys. This private keys are used together with the public keys to encrypt
user votes cast in the election.

MOSCOW BLOCKCHAIN VOTING SYSTEM ENCRYPTION BROKEN IN 20 MINUTES

Gaudry blamed the issue on Russian officials using a variant of the ElGamal
encryption scheme that used encryption key sizes that were too small to be
secure. This meant that modern computers could break the encryption scheme
within minutes.

"It can be broken in about 20 minutes using a standard personal computer,
and using only free software that is publicly available," Gaudry said in a
report published earlier this month.

"Once these [private keys] are known, any encrypted data can be decrypted as
quickly as they are created," he added.

  (CNet)

Laura Hautala, CNet 15 Aug 2019) via ACM TechNews, 23 Aug 2019

U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg has ordered Georgia not to use its
paperless voting machines, election management software, or servers for the
2020 election, requiring the state to implement a new voting system in time
for the presidential primaries. Georgia is currently acquiring new
electronic voting machines and vote-counting software. The court order will
prevent the state from relying on its paperless voting machines and election
management software if the replacement infrastructure is not ready in time;
should this happen, Georgia may have to fall back on paper ballots. Attorney
David Cross said the order ``is a big win for all Georgia voters and those
working across the country to secure elections and protect the right to
vote.''

"The Federal Emergency Management Agency has wasted more than $3 billion and

floods, storms and other events that states could have handled on their own,
an investigation by E&E News shows."

As noted in http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/31/36#subj12, nations and
localities are struggling to plan prioritized disaster response
allocation. FEMA-level response dilution, partially driven by climate

made public in the past two weeks.

However, while the security researcher reported the first one to Valve and
tried to have it fixed before public disclosure, he said he couldn't do the

Subject: Ransomware Attacks Are Testing Resolve of Cities Across America
  (NYT)

At the public library in Wilmer, Tex., books were checked out not with the
beeps of bar code readers but with the scratches of pen on notebook paper.
Out on the street, police officers were literally writing tickets -- by
hand. When the entire computer network that keeps the small town's
bureaucracy afloat was recently hacked, Wilmer was thrown into the digital
Dark Ages.

This has been the summer of crippling ransomware attacks. Wilmer -- a town
of almost 5,000 people just south of Dallas -- is one of 22 cities across
Texas that are simultaneously being held hostage for millions of dollars
<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/us/texas-ransomware.html?module=inline>
after a sophisticated hacker, perhaps a group of them, infiltrated their
computer systems and encrypted their data. The attack instigated a statewide
disaster-style response that includes the National Guard and a widening
F.B.I. inquiry.

More than 40 municipalities have been the victims of cyberattacks this year,
from major cities such as Baltimore, Albany and Laredo, Tex., to smaller
towns including Lake City, Fla. Lake City is one of the few cities to have
paid a ransom demand -- about $460,000 in Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency --
because it thought reconstructing its systems would be even more costly.
(https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/us/florida-ransom-hack.html?module=inline)

In most ransomware cases, the identities and whereabouts of culprits are
cloaked by clever digital diversions. Intelligence officials, using data
collected by the National Security Agency and others in an effort to
identify the sources of the hacking, say many have come from Eastern Europe,
Iran and, in some cases, the United States. The majority have targeted
small-town America, figuring that sleepy, cash-strapped local governments
*are the least likely to have updated their cyberdefenses or backed up their
data*...

bank, but a lot of companies are outsourcing a lot of IT functions, so that
wasn't exactly definitive.  It had a couple of headers indicative of spam

About the only thing that solidly demonstrated a problem was the

A better headline and subhead for the original story might be:

Amazon does seem disingenuous with its claim that the software should be

Subject: Re: Electric car charging stations may be portals for power grid
  cyberattacks (RISKS-31.37)

I did not see what types of charging stations were involved.

The flip side is that reversing flow and drawing power from e-vehicles has
been proposed has been proposed as a way to smooth out demand spikes and to
store surplus wind and solar power when they are parked plugged in.

I have to speculate that this risk involves Level 3 or higher stations.

With the demise of the last gas station in downtown Vancouver BC, and the
proliferation of "free" (TANSTAAFL) or pay to use fast charging stations at
parking lots and underground garages this might be a risk, but not likely
for 110 or 220 volt charging stations. I did not bother to install a level 2
charger for our plug in hybrid because it charges from the carport plug in
5.5 hours with about the same draw as a major kitchen appliance.

Other protection in the electric distribution system could put them offline
before a large section goes down. Canadian wiring specs require the top and
bottom sockets of kitchen counter outlets, and adjacent outlets, to be on
separate circuits. You need at least 4 circuits to wire a kitchen according
to code if you have 2 or more kitchen outlets.

Don't Grid Controllers in the UK have TVs in the control rooms to monitor
Football (Soccer in Canadian & USA English) games because so many fans tend
to plug in electric kettles during long pauses and ad breaks? Pumped Hydro
Electric Storage generators in Wales and elsewhere can be spun up to meet
those demand surges when the operators see a break coming. We don't need
electric cars to experience this type of power demand surge.

In Canada the equivalent is the Hockey Game Flush, as thousands of fans
flush toilets, creating a risk of municipal water lines collapsing or having
infiltration due to sharp drops in water pressure. System ops watch the
game, ready to start turbo boost pumps during breaks and stop them at the
end of the break.

Rushing into print or digital publication of new startling results from
recently deployed or newly developed instruments is a known risk in Climate
Research.

Someone rushed into print with an "Oceans are Cooling" paper, based on
comparing early Argo Buoy data with older XBT data. With the wisdom of
hindsight the Argo data had a Cold bias and the XBT data had a Warm
bias. Longer term study revealed the bias in both instruments.

https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/OceanCooling

Instrument Bias also came up when Anthony Watt enlisted an army of fans to
create a list of "poorly sited" weather stations which they felt gave a warm
bias to the NOAA conclusion of a warming trend in the Continental USA. NOAA
repeated the analysis, excluding those stations, and got a slightly stronger
warming trend. Be careful what you ask for.

  purpose/reason/justification for data capture based on air marshal
  prerogative.

  "2. A list of federal and state agencies that have approved
  direct/indirect access to these records and include dates/time/purpose for
  access.

  "Your request has been processed under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552, and the
  Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C 552a. A search was conducted within the TSA and no
  records responsive to your request were located."

Guess the skies are safe to fly after all? While a sample size of 1 does not
prove much, the TSA response suggests that citizens of "sufficient interest"
merit air marshal tracking and attention. What constitutes "sufficient
interest" was not a petition subject, and therefore not disclosed.
