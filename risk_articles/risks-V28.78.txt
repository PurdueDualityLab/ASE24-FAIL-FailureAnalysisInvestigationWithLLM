  `Ancient Liberty' Protected by the United States Constitution (VJoLT)

Virginia Journal of Law and Technology via NNSquad
http://www.vjolt.net/vol2/issue/vol2_art2.html

  In this electronic and digital age, the ability of a speaker and a
  selected audience to communicate in confidence about subjects chosen by
  them may be critical to the survival of free speech and privacy.[1] It is
  the primary purpose of this paper to demonstrate that, from the early
  years of the American Republic, Americans have enjoyed a robust, free, and
  frequent use of codes, ciphers, and other forms of secret
  communication.[2] Secondarily, this paper will demonstrate that Americans
  have long used secret modes of communication for numerous purposes,
  including political dissent, preservation of personal privacy in intimate
  matters, commerce, and criminal enterprises.[3]

Long. Detailed. Read as much as you can.

Subject: The Dangers of Internet voting (Hans A. von Spakovsky)

Hans A. von Spakovsky. Heritage, 14 July 2015 [Bastille Day]
http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2015/07/the-dangers-of-internet-voting

Those who believe that it is possible given current technology to create a
secure online voting system are dangerously mistaken.  According to computer
experts, Internet voting is vulnerable to cyber-attack and fraud --
vulnerabilities inherent in current hardware and software, as well as the
basic manner in which the Internet is organized -- and it is unlikely that
these vulnerabilities will be eliminated in the near future.  Internet
voting, or even the delivery by e-mail of voted ballots from registered
voters, would be vulnerable to a variety of well-known cyber-attacks, any of
which could be catastrophic.  Such attacks could even be launched by an enemy
agency beyond the reach of U.S. law and could cause significant voter
disenfranchisement, privacy violations, vote buying and selling, and vote
switching.  The biggest danger, however, is that such attacks could be
completely undetected.

Subject: Report on Internet voting

U.S. Vote Foundation, July 2015
The Future of Voting: End to End Verifiable Internet Voting
https://www.usvotefoundation.org/e2e-viv/summary

Internet Voting Today

Internet voting was first proposed over thirty years ago. Since then, many
governments and businesses have created Internet voting technologies that
have been used to collect millions of votes in public elections.

However, computer scientists, cryptographers, and cybersecurity experts warn
that no current Internet voting system is sufficiently secure and reliable
for use in public elections.

Part of the problem is that existing systems do not allow third parties to
observe the election system and independently verify that the results are
correct. In fact, most vendors explicitly forbid such oversight.

Recommendations

The five key recommendations of this report are:

 * Any public elections conducted over the Internet must be end-to-end
   verifiable.

 * No Internet voting system of any kind should be used for public elections
   before end-to-end verifiable in-person voting systems have been widely
   deployed and experience has been gained from their use.

 * End-to-end verifiable systems must be designed, constructed, verified,
   certified, operated, and supported according to the most rigorous
   engineering requirements of mission- and safety-critical systems.

 * E2E-VIV systems must be usable and accessible.

 * Many challenges remain in building a usable, reliable, and secure E2E-VIV
   system. They must be overcome before using Internet voting for public
   elections. Research and development efforts toward overcoming those
   challenges should continue.

     [Based on everything we have seen in the past 31 years that I have been
     involved in seeking trustworthy elections, this report seems to have
     some very timely and incisive guidance.  PGN]

Subject: U.N. body agrees to U.S. norms in cyberspace (Joseph Marks)

Joseph Marks, Internet Policy, Politico, in Dave Farber's IP, 9 Jul 2015
http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/un-body-agrees-to-us-norms-in-cyberspace-119900.html

A United Nations body has agreed for the first time that there are rules of
the road in cyberspace that all nations should respect, even during
peacetime, a senior State Department official tells POLITICO.

It's a breakthrough for U.S. diplomats, who have been pushing these norms as
an alternative to formal treaties as a way to help tame the lawless frontier
of cyberspace.

The norms agreed by the U.N.'s Group of Governmental Experts include
understandings that nations should not intentionally damage each other's
critical infrastructure with cyberattacks; should not target each other's
cyber emergency responders; and should assist other nations investigating
cyberattacks and cybercrime launched from their territories.  [...]

AFR via NNSquad

  Just after lunch on an autumn day, two plain-clothed police officers
  approached a slender young man from opposite directions, unfazed that the
  lobby was busy with foreigners and local business people.  Showing good
  field craft, the officer approaching from behind called out the blogger's
  name. As he turned, the other slipped on the handcuffs.  "They took me
  away like an eagle does its prey," says the blogger with Chinese
  precision.  At a nearby police station, in addition to the handcuffs,
  shackles were placed on his ankles. They would remain in place for 24
  hours while he was interrogated.  Blackmail was the blogger's stated
  crime, although no documents were produced to substantiate these
  allegations.  "They told me just confess to something and you can go
  home.  If I didn't co-operate, they said, 'you will be in jail for years'."

Christine Wong, *IT Business*, 13 Jul 2015

Wearable technology won't just affect athletes' performances but also their
privacy, and that could change the business of sports forever, according to
experts at a Toronto sector forum.

Subject: Securing networks is harder than it was two years ago (BetaNews)

Enterprises face evolving security challenges and solutions due to the
introduction of cloud infrastructures. Growing cloud adoption has been
identified as one of the key reasons why a majority of IT and security
professionals find securing their networks more difficult today than two
years ago.
<http://betanews.com/2015/07/08/securing-networks-is-harder-than-it-was-two-years-ago/>

Network security company Tufin <http://www.tufin.com/> has produced an
infographic, based on a recent research report with ESG, looking at why 56
percent of professionals believe network security is getting harder.

Subject: Bitcoin wallets vulnerable to double-spending bug (BetaNews)

The cryptocurrency Bitcoin has not been without its problems. There have
been numerous hacks leading to the loss of millions of dollars, and Bitcoin
mining tool Epic Scale became embroiled in a crapware scandal with uTorrent
The latest problem to hit the digital currency is a double-spending bug.

<http://betanews.com/2015/07/05/bitcoin-wallets-vulnerable-to-double-spending-bug/>

As the name suggests, this essentially makes it possible to spend the same
Bitcoins twice, and it stems from a problem with a planned upgrade. An
issue with some Bitcoin miners means that tests that usually prevent
double-spending are not correctly performed. The problem was discovered on
4 July as many Americans were busy celebrating Independence Day.

Subject: Casper Bowden has died (BetaNews)

The man who cared about your online privacy has died, Caspar Bowden, the
privacy advocate who was warning about the activities of the NSA before
Edward Snowden, has died. The co-founder of the Foundation for Information
Policy Research lost his battle with cancer, and tributes have been paid by
the world of technology.

<http://betanews.com/2015/06/02/usa-freedom-act-passes-limiting-nsa/>

Bowden, the former head of privacy at Microsoft, had long-warned about
potential backdoors in software and services.  He campaigned passionately
for the privacy of the individual and voiced grave concerns about the NSA
and the FISA Amendment Act.  He sat on the board of Tor and was one of the
most knowledgeable and well-loved figures on the privacy scene.

No idea about the solution; personally I feel that the problem is
governments trying to legislate for a better world.  Obviously people should
be nice to each other, but making this a legal requirement may well swap one
lot of difficulties for another.  I'm not a lawyer either, but bringing
human relationships and behaviour into law looks like a mighty challenge.
As Pontius Pilate famously asked, "what is truth?".

  [The truth may be a long history of some governments trying to legislate
  not for an altruistic better world for everyone else, but according to
  self-serving special interests.  We seem to differ.  PGN]

Subject: Re: Chicago's 'cloud tax' makes Netflix ... more expensive (R-28.77)

This is an extremely disingenuous article.  Chicago has had an amusements
tax for a very long time, and has levied it on cable TV subscriptions.  I
believe that's instead of sales tax, and in fact it's slightly lower than
the city's sales tax.

This ruling is follows the quacks-like-a-duck rule.  Netflix and Spotify
deliver the same kind of material that services like HBO (and I suppose
Muzak) do, so now they're taxed the same.  In response to hand-wavy
questions about how can you tell where someone is in the cloud, these are
paid services, and the customers have billing addresses.

The only thing that's puzzling is why people still expect to get a free ride
just because something happens to have IP packets in its path.
