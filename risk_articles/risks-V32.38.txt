State-sponsored actors are "very likely" trying to shore up their cyber
capabilities to attack Canada's critical infrastructure - such as the
electricity supply - to intimidate or to prepare for future online assaults,
a new intelligence assessment warns.

"As physical infrastructure and processes continue to be connected to the
Internet, cyber threat activity has followed, leading to increasing risk to
the functioning of machinery and the safety of Canadians," says a new
national cyber threat assessment drafted by the Communications Security
Establishment.

"We judge that state-sponsored actors are very likely attempting to develop
the additional cyber capabilities required to disrupt the supply of
electricity in Canada."

Subject: An Engineer Gets 9 Years for Stealing $10M From Microsoft (WiReD)

A former Microsoft software engineer from Ukraine has been sentenced
<https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/former-microsoft-software-engineer-sentenced-nine-years-prison-stealing-more-10-million>
to nine years in prison for stealing more than $10 million in store credit
from Microsoft's <https://www.wired.com/tag/microsoft/> online store. From
2016 to 2018, Volodymyr Kvashuk worked for Microsoft as a tester, placing
mock online orders to make sure everything was working smoothly.

The software automatically prevented shipment of physical products to
testers like Kvashuk. But in a crucial oversight, it didn't block the
purchase of virtual gift cards. So the 26-year-old Kvashuk discovered that
he could use his test account to buy real store credit and then use the
credit to buy real products.  [...]

Kvashuk has been ordered to pay $8.3 million in restitution, though it seems
unlikely he'll ever be able to do that. The government says he may be
deported after serving his time in prison.

It said that it had found "some extremely dangerous items" for sale on
Amazon, eBay and Wish.

The warnings were echoed by watchdog Which? and the Trading Standards

Maker of password manager app details worst passwords of 2020

https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/nordpass-list-of-most-common-and-worst-passwords-1.5807089

People are still using the most basic of Internet passwords that can be
easily cracked, according to a database analysis by password manager
NordPass.

Its list of the 200 most common passwords for online accounts in 2020 was
released after a review of nearly 275.7 million passwords.

Coming in first was "123456," used by 2.5 million people, after landing in
second place last year. NordPass said it has been breached more than 23.5
million times.

The data shows many people stubbornly cling to using weak passwords, even

Subject: Apple Lets Some of its Big Sur macOS Apps Bypass Firewall and VPNs

  [via Geoff Goodfellow]

Apple is facing the heat for a new feature in macOS Big Sur that allows many
of its own apps to bypass firewalls and VPNs, thereby potentially allowing
malware to exploit the same shortcoming to access sensitive data stored on
users' systems and transmit them to remote servers.

The issue was first spotted last month by a Twitter user named Maxwell in a
beta version of the operating system.

"Some Apple apps bypass some network extensions and VPN Apps," Maxwell
*tweeted* <https://twitter.com/mxswd/status/1318305284524183552>. "Maps for
example can directly access the Internet bypassing any NEFilterDataProvider
or NEAppProxyProviders you have running."

But now that the iPhone maker has released the latest version of macOS to
the public on November 12, the behavior has been left unchanged, prompting
concerns from security researchers, who say the change is ripe for abuse.

Of particular note is the possibility that the bypass can leave macOS
systems open to attack, not to mention the inability to limit or block
network traffic at users' discretion.
According to Jamf security researcher *Patrick Wardle*
<https://twitter.com/patrickwardle/status/1327726496203476992>, the
company's 50 Apple-specific apps and processes have been exempted from
firewalls like Little Snitch and Lulu.

The change in behavior comes as Apple *deprecated support*

Extensions last year in favor of Network Extensions Framework   [...]

Subject: Apple to pay $113M to settle state investigation into iPhone
  *Battererygate*  (WashPost)

Apple will pay $113 million to settle an investigation by nearly three dozen
states into the tech giant’s past practice of slowing custome'
old iPhones in an attempt to preserve their batteries.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/18/apple-fine-battery/

I think I filed claims for two affected phones; I also had batteries
replaced in them for $29/each when Apple was doing that for penance.

I have to say that this...

That December, Apple acknowledged the practice, explaining that it had
tweaked its technology starting a year earlier so that some older models,
including the iPhone 6S, did not shut down unexpectedly or experience other
malfunctions due to excessive demands on their dated batteries. The
widespread blowback also prompted Apple to issue a public apology -- a
rarity for the image-conscious tech giant -- and to begin offering
battery-replacement discounts for consumers.

...doesn't sound entirely malign -- would shutdowns or other malfunctions
really have been better than slowdowns? -- except it was done secretly. And
given the huge set of Settings options, adding battery controls wouldn't
have been burdensome. Now, at least, battery health can be user determined
(though apparently there are more comprehensive battery tests only Apple can
run). And, weirdly, iPadOS doesn't display iPad battery health; you need
nifty/free PC/Mac utility iMazing for that).

Subject: Privacy labeling for Apple apps

Apple will, as of December 8th, start requiring standardized summaries of
information gathering and privacy behaviour for new and updated apps in the
app store.  https://www.theregister.com/2020/11/06/apple_privacy_advice/ In
the announcement, Apple referred to the summaries as being like nutritional
labels on food, which phrase seems to have caught the media's imagination.

Details of the requirements are given at
https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/ The "labels"
don't seem to be that far removed from the "permissions" that Android apps
list, and don't give that much more information about collection.

Having recently created a presentation on differential privacy, it strikes
me that this is one of the first outcomes of Apple's grand announcement of
its commitment to the technology in 2016.  Differential privacy does allow
for some version of metrics for privacy, but so far it has been a rather
academic exercise.

This announcement doesn't push it much further.

results in an actual, useful, working device.  I am, again, reminded of
differential privacy: some great ideas, but the outcomes that people tend to
actually present are less than earth-shattering, in reality.

Second reaction: although the article seems to be reasonably detailed, there
simply isn't enough information on iO in there to make any real assessment.

"'If you unknowingly spread covid to higher-risk individuals in your family,
there's no do-over for that,' Landon said."

problem.

Second opinions can be helpful, but if their recommendations differ?  Choose

Subject: Functional and assurance requirements and CoVID

With the recent surges in CoVID-19 cases (pretty much everywhere), parents
have become (understandably) concerned about the welfare and safety of their
children, particularly at school.  There have been widespread calls for
school closures, or, at the very least, mandatory mask wearing for all staff
and students.  However, looking at the situation in terms of both functional
and assurance requirements demonstrates that these concerns are unnecessary,
or, at least, misplaced.

First lets look at the functional requirements.  For the most part, controls
against the pandemic are still basic and widely known.  But they are
problematic in regard to schools.  Isolation is the most effective.
However, classrooms are too few, and too small, for completely effective
isolation.  Desktop and other barrier systems are possibly expensive and
time-consuming to construct and install in many places, and, in any case,
are limited at best.  Distance learning carries its own set of problems.
Handwashing is good, and, particularly in the younger grades, you can really
get students to buy into it.  But it's not complete.  (And forget trying to
get teenagers to do it regularly.)  And any teacher knows that telling kids,
especially in the primary grades, to keep physically distant from each other
is just not going to work.  (Actually, if you tell students in the primary
grades that it's a game, that their friends are radioactive, and that if
they get close enough for their outstretched hand to touch their friends'
outstretched hands they'll both explode, it'd probably work.  It's the
teenagers who seem to think that social distancing means six inches.)  And
I've written elsewhere about masks, but it is difficult to get kids,
particularly younger kids, to wear them consistently and properly.

However, when we look at assurance requirements, we find a much different
picture.  One of the assurance requirements is detailed contact tracing,
looking at where, how, and in what situations the infection actually (as
opposed to theoretically) does spread.  Part of this, of course, gives us
information about which controls actually do work.  But often it just gives
us information about risk levels.  And, even in these "resurgent" times,
schools are not dangerous places.

Detailed contact tracing has demonstrated that the number of actual
transmissions of the infection in schools is startlingly small, given the
problems we have just looked at with functional requirements and controls.
In British Columbia, while general case numbers jumped from 5,000 to over
20,000, there were only three outbreaks in schools, and, in those outbreaks,
it seems to be impossible to prove that any infections actually took place
*at* school.  Schools do seem to reflect the prevalence of the case numbers,
and, during this surge, exposure events at schools have increased, but cases
of actual transmission seem to be vanishingly small.

Unfortunately, we do not yet have enough data to know exactly why this is
the case.  It may be that children, particularly young children, have
differences in their immune systems that make them less susceptible to the
coronavirus, but that would not explain why there are almost no cases of
student to teacher transmission.  It may be that, despite the problematic
nature of the functional controls, the fact that children are better at
"sticking to the rules" means that the layered defence works better than in
adults (who often seem to think that wearing a mask means you can neglect
all the other safeguards).  At this point we still don't know enough to
explain it.

There are other things that the assurance requirement of detailed contact
tracing can demonstrate, but not explain.  We have seen that transmission in
restaurants is low, but transmission in bars is very much higher.  Why is
that the case?  The two situations are very similar.  Bars do the same level
of cleaning as restaurants, and often have the same capacity limitations.
Alcohol is served at restaurants as well as bars.  But bars have higher
transmission rates.  In fact, the data even shows that transmission rates,
in both bars *and* restaurants, is higher after 10 pm than before.  Why?  Is
it just because patrons are drunker (and drunk people make worse decisions
about sticking to the rules)?  We can't yet explain why, but we do know that
it is the case.

In security, we often pursue functional requirements and neglect assurance.
After all, it is functional requirements that direct us to technologies and
systems and processes that keep us safe.  But it is assurance requirements
that tell us whether the technologies and systems and processes actually
*do* keep us safe, or whether we are wasting resources on controls that
don't actually do anything for us.  We need that assurance.

Subject: Wrong GPS usual suspects First Responder avoidance

Today I noticed that my friends' cell phones' GPS all show the same wrong
place when not fully warmed up. Year in and year out.

So that got me thinking, there must be about one of these points every few
kilometers.

So all rescue departments need to do is keep a list of them. Then, say,
someone calls in "Help me, I'm at xxx.xxx,yyy.yyy," the First Responders
could reply, "Give your GPS a few more minutes to warm up, then call us
back."

Actually they don't need a full list. All they need is the algorithms of how
those points are arrived at. Yes, they are like 12.000 for 12.345, but
"binary". Sure, different chips have different algorithms. And maybe AGPS is
involved, etc. OK, now generate a list for your local area.

So next time somebody calls in with one of those suspect coordinate pairs,
right down to the millimeter, just tell them to take a deep breath...

Subject: 'Bot Battle' Shows What Happens When Two AI Programs Go On a Date
  (Vice)

To test its superiority, one AI company put out a call for tech firms to
challenge their AI bot head-to-head.

What happens when two AI programs go on a date? Well, apparently, a few
stumbles, a lot of flattery, and one, ``It is exciting that I get to kill
people'' comment.

AI company Pandorabots, Inc. and Facebook AI have gone head-to-head in a
``Bot Battle'' for the ages. Streamed on Twitch, the two programs interacted
with each other for three weeks straight. Viewers were able to vote on
which company's mascot they believe held conversation the best.
Pandorabot's Kuki, a female embodied agent sporting a neon bob haircut, won
in a landslide victory picking up 78 percent of the vote. Her opponent was
Facebook's Blenderbot, who sports a ``Make Facebook Great Again'' hat in true
Zucker-bro style.

Pandorabots created the competition to put their program on display, a
Medium post by Kuki's creator, Steve Worswick, explains. ``We are planning
to get more bots -- and some humans!  -- into the arena to hang with
Kuki. We will also continue to iterate and update the avatars," he wrote.

During the battle, which drew more than 400,000 views during the three-week
stream, the bots talked about everything from the election to an in-depth
history of Pac-Man. The two even gave an attempt at making jokes. Remember,
the conversation was completely autonomous from human involvement and the
bots are running day and night. Still, at best the conversation was
followable and somewhat complex. At times it turned into a staring contest
where nothing was said. Many of the silences were awkward. And other times
the conversation completely derailed into a splurge of courteous
compliments.  [...]

Subject: AI is wrestling with a replication crisis (MIT Tech Review)

*Tech giants dominate research but the line between real breakthrough and
product showcase can be fuzzy. Some scientists have had enough.*

Last month Nature published a damning response
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2766-y> written by 31 scientists
to a study from Google Health
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1799-6> that had appeared in the
journal earlier this year. Google was describing successful trials of an AI
that looked for signs of breast cancer in medical images. But according to
its critics, the Google team provided so little information about its code
and how it was tested that the study amounted to nothing more than a
promotion of proprietary tech.

``We couldn't take it anymore,'' says Benjamin Haibe-Kains, the lead author
of the response, who studies computational genomics at the University of
Toronto. ``It's not about this study in particular -- it's a trend we've
been witnessing for multiple years now that has started to really bother
us.''

Haibe-Kains and his colleagues are among a growing number of scientists
pushing back against a perceived lack of transparency in AI research.
``When we saw that paper from Google, we realized that it was yet another
example of a very high-profile journal publishing a very exciting study that
has nothing to do with science,'' he says. ``It's more an advertisement for
cool technology. We can't really do anything with it.''

Science is built on a bedrock of trust, which typically involves sharing
enough details about how research is carried out to enable others to
replicate it, verifying results for themselves. This is how science
self-corrects and weeds out results that don't stand up. Replication also
allows others to build on those results, helping to advance the field.
Science that can't be replicated falls by the wayside.

At least, that's the idea. In practice, few studies are fully replicated
because most researchers are more interested in producing new results than
reproducing old ones. But in fields like biology and physics--and computer
science overall--researchers are typically expected to provide the
information needed to rerun experiments, even if those reruns are rare.

Ambitious noob...

An analysis of nearly 500 Covid-related apps worldwide shows major
differences in how much data they expect you to give up.

The results show that only 47 of that subset of 359 apps use Google and
Apple's more privacy-friendly exposure-notification system, which restricts
apps to only Bluetooth data collection. More than six out of seven
Covid-focused iOS apps worldwide are free to request whatever privacy
permissions they want, with 59 percent asking for a user's location when in
use and 43 percent tracking location at all times.  Albright found that 44
percent of Covid apps on iOS asked for access to the phone's camera, 22
percent of apps asked for access to the user's microphone, 32 percent asked
for access to their photos, and 11 percent asked for access to their
contacts.

Subject: Metrics and CoVID

Another security lesson from CoVID is in regard to metrics.  Those who have
tried to create security metrics will know, all too well, how difficult it
is to choose those that are actually useful, rather than just being
collections of numbers.  (Brotby and Hinson's PRAGMATIC acronym is very
helpful in providing guidance.)

Among the various statistics that CoVID has generated, such as case rates,
new cases, doubling time of cases, hospitalization rates, et cetera, one
single number that has been consistently useful is the positivity rate.
This is the number of cases confirmed, divided by the total tests done.
Donald Trump to the contrary, while there are a number of additional factors
to consider, it seems to be generally felt that a positivity rate of about
two percent is probably reasonable.  Any lower, and it is likely that you
are testing too many people too indiscriminately, and wasting money and
resources.  Any higher, and it is likely that you aren't testing enough, and
that cases are, or shortly will be, increasing.  Positivity has proven
itself "Relevant" from the PRAGMATIC list.

Recently, in British Columbia, we have seen how difficult it may be to keep
such metrics "Meaningful" and "Accurate."

BC, often known as "Hollywood North," is home to a thriving and active film
industry.  If you are a fan of Hallmark romances and mysteries, and other
such "made for TV" fare, chances are very good that they were shot here.
(When Gloria and I watch them, it is often as much to play "spot the
location" as to follow the plots.)  This is especially true now during the
pandemic, when BC has been a relatively safe place to do film shoots.  There
are, of course, a number of restrictions to keep filmmaking safe, some
imposed by local health authorities, and some required by unions,
particularly from the US and places where the case rates have been much
higher, demanding fairly stringent precautions.  CoVID testing, in
particular, is done regularly, and often very frequently, regardless of how
many cases turn up.

Testing for the movie industry is done at private labs, so as not to affect
lab capacity for the public health system.  However, even so, the testing is
"reportable," and thus the numbers make their way into public figures.  The
demands of the movie industry are such that 4-5,000 tests may be done daily,
at a time when the public testing capacity is about 16,000 tests per day.
Since the movie industry definitely "overtests," the movie numbers
artificially depress the overall positivity rate.  Our positivity rate in BC
may actually be twice what the published figures show.

Subject: Two-Factor Eggs in One Basket

A friend of mine got the newest Iphone. Being latest and greatest he wants
it to be all 5G-est, too, and that part isn't working right. Word is he
needed a different SIM, and I don't follow all the details.

Anyway, at this point some Verizon person probably needs to walk through
network settings to fix something set wrong. Okay.

But my friend takes covid-19 seriously and doesn't want to go to the
store. Okay, smart.

I'm sure he could go through the settings by phone call.

Nope: My friend hopped on the two-factor bandwagon and Verizon won't talk to
him without texting him aboard their two-factor ritual, and he says that
doesn't work with the new SIM. Sure, he could put in the old SIM where it
does work, but he needs to debug the 5G SIM…

I've always thought two-factor was a great idea for really high value
accounts, with lots of talented high end support at the ready, but I don't
understand why people think it scales to everyone for everything.

Subject: 'Most Secure' U.S. Election Not Without Problems

Lucas Ropek, *Government Technology*, 16 Nov 2020
via ACM TechNews, Wednesday, November 18, 2020

Although federal officials declared the 2020 presidential election the "most
secure in American history," there were still technical problems. Alleged
software glitches caused mistakes in vote tabulation for both presidential
and local races in certain counties, while some communities suffered
temporary miscounts due to clerical errors. Threats of foreign interference
appear to have been countered by greater vigilance and stronger
cyberdefenses by watchdogs like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency, and multi-stakeholder collaboration and information
sharing. However, disinformation and misinformation have continued to fuel
polarization of the electorate. Former ACM president Barbara Simons urges
greater transparency and committed investment in auditable machinery as top
priorities, along with curtailing the use of paperless voting machines.

Election Security Experts Contradict Trump's Voting Claims
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/16/business/election-security-letter-trump.html

Fifty-nine of the country's top computer scientists and election security
experts rebuked President Trump's baseless claims of voter fraud and hacking
on Monday, writing that such assertions are ``unsubstantiated or are
technically incoherent.''

The rebuttal, in a letter to be published on various websites, did not
mention Mr. Trump by name but amounted to another forceful corrective to the
torrents of disinformation that he has posted on Twitter.  ``Anyone
asserting that a U.S. election was *rigged* is making an extraordinary
claim, one that must be supported by persuasive and verifiable evidence.''
In the absence of evidence, they added, it is simply `speculation'.  ``To
our collective knowledge, no credible evidence has been put forth that
supports a conclusion that the 2020 election outcome in any state has been
altered through technical compromise,'' they wrote.  [...]

Subject: Blockchain Voting Risks Undetectable Nation-Scale Failures
  (Stilgherrian)

Stilgherrian, ZDNet, 16 Nov 2020
via ACM TechNews, Monday, November 16, 2020

A study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers labeled
assertions that Internet- and blockchain-based voting would boost election
security "misleading," adding that they would "greatly increase the risk of
undetectable, nation-scale election failures." The MIT team analyzed
previous research on the security risks of online and offline voting
systems, and found blockchain solutions are vulnerable to scenarios where
election results might have been erroneously or deliberately changed. The
MIT researchers proposed five minimal election security mandates: ballot
secrecy to deter intimidation or vote-buying; software independence to
verify results with something like a paper trail; voter-verifiable ballots,
where voters themselves witness that their vote has been correctly recorded;
contestability, where someone who spots an error can persuade others that
the error is real; and an auditing process.

The Radio Spätkauf podcast has a five part series called "How to F*

Many of the failures were due to political interference and a staggering
level of arrogance and incompetence, but a certain amount is technical, such
as the fact that physics tells us that if you increase the size of the
terminal, the ventilation requirements and particularly the emergency smoke
removal ventilation do not scale linearly. Or that it is not a good idea to
cram power and signal wires into the same undersized pipe.
