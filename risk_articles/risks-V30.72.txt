Subject: Another risk of driverless cars

NPR reported today that Waymo is buying a slew of cars to create a
driverless taxi fleet with no human overseer required in the car.  Emergency
takeover would be done by a fleet of well-trained remote admin personnel,
*via cell phone*.

There seem to be some massive flaws in that reasoning.  One is the need for
real-time response.  Another is unavailable cell-phone coverage.

I recall the case of someone who used his cellphone to start his car at
home, and then drove into Red Rock Canyon Park, parked, and later tried to
start his car (with the presence of his cellphone).  Unfortunately, he had
left his wireless unlocking/starting dongle at home, and there was no cell
coverage in the canyon.  His wife climbed up out of the canyon, called a
neighbor who could get the remote dongle out of their house, and bring it to
them so that they could drive home.

Just one more example of short-sightedness and lack of awareness...

Subject: Emirates looks to windowless planes (bbc.com)

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44383220

Aviation safety expert Professor Graham Braithwaite of Cranfield University:

  ``Cabin crew need to be able to see outside the aircraft if there is an
  emergency.  Being able to see outside the aircraft in an emergency is
  important, especially if an emergency evacuation has to take place.  Flight
  attendants would need to check outside the aircraft in an emergency, for
  example for fire, before opening a door and commencing an evacuation - and
  anything that needed power to do this may not be easy to get certified by
  an aviation safety regulator.''  Prof Braithwaite said the main obstacle
  in a windowless aircraft would be passenger perceptions of the
  technology.

  However, aviation regulator the European Aviation Safety Agency said: "We
  do not see any specific challenge that could not be overcome to ensure a
  level of safety equivalent to the one of an aircraft fitted with cabin
  windows.

In addition to emergency evacuation slides, perhaps an emergency "peep hole"
to supplement camera or screen failure?

  [Perhaps the pilots would not need windows either, because everything is
  computer controlled?  PGN]

  (Irfan Khan)

(Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)
Mercado de Los Angeles in Boyle Heights on Tuesday.
Poll worker Shannon Diaz puts up signs as voting begins at El Mercado de
Los Angeles in Boyle Heights on Tuesday.

If you are a registered voter in Los Angeles County and poll workers say
they can't find your name on the roster at the polling place when you go to
vote, don't worry -- you can still cast a provisional ballot.

Some Angelenos needed a bit of reassurance that their votes would be counted
in Tuesday's primary election after 118,522 voters' names were accidentally
left off rosters due to a printing error, according to L.A.  County
Registrar Dean C. Logan.

About 2.3% of L.A. County's 5.1 million registered voters and 35% of the
county's 4,357 precincts were affected by the error, according to figures
provided by the registrar-recorder/county clerk's office, which was still
trying to determine the reason for the printing error. Voters whose names
are missing are being encouraged to file provisional ballots, which are
verified by vote counters later.

Subject: Ontario election results Not a Number

Early in the counting for the Ontario provincial election on Thursday
evening 2018-06-07, I noticed the CBC election site displayed this dynamic
table of popular vote numbers:

Party    Votes    Vote Share
PC      389,435    40.45%
NDP     333,475    34.63%
LIB     174,446    18.12%
GRN      48,022     4.99%
OTH      17,467      NaN%

The "NaN%" survived several on-the-fly updates to the numbers.

When I checked on Friday morning, with final results in, the table was

Party    Votes    Vote Share
PC      2,322,422    40.63%
NDP     1,925,574    33.69%
LIB     1,103,283    19.30%
GRN       263,987     4.62%
OTH       100,058     1.75%

It's not obvious to me why the first set of numbers should lead to a NaN for
the "OTH" parties vote share rather than 1.81%. The page is still there at
https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/onvotes/results if anyone cares to
investigate the code, but I don't know how long it'll last.  One trusts that
this code is purely for display on the CBC website, and has nothing to do
with actual vote tallying...

In passing, this election was conducted with paper ballots hand marked and
scanned by machine, with the ballots retained for hand recount if necessary,
so pretty much Best Practice as I understand it. I don't believe any such
recount has been called for.

In Florida, the site of recent mass shootings such as at the Stoneman
Douglas High School and the Pulse nightclub, more than a year went by in
which the state approved applications without carrying out background
checks. This meant the state was unaware if there was a cause to refuse a
licence to allow somebody to carry a hidden gun -- for example, mental
illness or drug addiction.

The reason is dismayingly banal: an employee couldn't remember her login.

  (Bloomberg)

Hydro-Quebec will temporarily stop processing requests from cryptocurrency
miners so that it can continue to fulfill its obligations to supply
electricity to the entire province.

Canada's biggest electric utility is facing unprecedented demand from
blockchain companies that exceeds Hydro-Quebec's short- and medium-term
capacity, according to a statement Thursday. In the coming days,
Hydro-Quebec will file an application to the province's energy regulator
proposing a selection process for blockchain industry projects.

Hydro-Quebec has been courting cryptocurrency miners in recent months in a
bid to soak up surplus energy from dams in northern Quebec. Power rates in
the province are the lowest in North America, both for consumers and
industrial customers.

The Liga de Fútbol Profesional, the body that runs the most important
sports competition in Spain, is using mobile phones of football fans to spy
on bars and other public establishments that put matches for their
clients. Millions of people in Spain have this application on their phone,
which accumulates more than 10 million downloads, according to data from
Google and Apple.

All of these people can become undercover informants for La Liga and the
owners of football television broadcasting rights. If they give their
consent for the app to use the device's microphone (which is common in many
applications), they are actually giving permission for La Liga to remotely
activate the phone's microphone and try to detect if what it sounds like is
a bar or public establishment where a football match is being projected
without paying the fee established by the chains that own the broadcasting
rights. In addition, use the geolocation of the phone to locate exactly
where that establishment is located.

However, after plundering the depths of Reddit and a select subreddit

Norman's datasets are far from what a standard AI would be exposed to.

The author argues that an "on the ground" confirmation is a wise precaution
to verify imagery content. Image processing algorithms can render misleading
impressions which affect major decisions.

"One example of the misuse of remotely sensed data was in 2003, when
satellite images were used as evidence of sites of weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq. These images revealed what were identified as active
chemical munitions bunkers and areas where earth had been graded and moved
to hide evidence of chemical production. This turned out not to be the
case."

"Trust but verify" remains a wise precaution to follow when analyzing
satellite imagery.

Microsoft, Github, and distributed revision control

People legitimately criticize Github for creating artificial centralization
of open source software & having a dysfunctional internal culture, and for
being a for-profit company. Microsoft's acquisition may not make any of
these things worse, & won't make them better. But, there's a really specific
& practical reason people not already boycotting github have begun to
consider it in response to the Microsoft acquisition: Microsoft's history of
using deals, acquisitions, & standards committees as anticompetitive tools.

Github was never going to do much of anything beside host your projects, and
since hosting your projects is its main business, it's not going to do nasty
things like delete them. Microsoft, however, is absolutely willing to do
that kind of thing if they decide they can get away with it. History bears
this out -- some of it recent. Microsoft hasn't been able to do it to the
likes of IBM or Netscape since the 90s, but only because their complacency
over the PC market has prevented them from being able to successfully branch
out into phones or servers; however, they have been happily performing their
embrace-extend-exterminate tactic on open source projects for the past
fifteen years.

(Note: If Github got as big as Microsoft & had side hustles as profitable,
they would do the same thing. This isn't about particular organizations
being evil -- capitalism forces organizations to act unethically and
illegally by punishing those unwilling to break the law.)

People concerned about open source software distribution being centralized
under the aegis of unreliable for-profit companies have been boycotting
Github & Gitlab for years, and Google Code and Sourceforge before that.
They've also been working on alternatives to central repositories.

Named data networking goes beyond simply ensuring that the owner of the
hostname is not a for-profit company (liable to throw out your data as soon
as they decide that it'll make them money to do so). Instead, DNS as a
single point of failure goes away entirely, along with reliance on data
centers.

If you're considering migrating away from Github -- even if the recent news
merely reminded you of problems Github has had for years -- take this
opportunity to migrate your repository to git-ssb or git-ipfs, instead of
moving to another temporary host-tied third party thing like gitlab or
bitbucket.  Your commits are already identified by hashes, so why not switch
to hashes entirely & use an NDN/DHT system? That way, there's no third party
that could take down your commits if it goes down. The entire DNS system
could die permanently & it wouldn't interrupt your development.

Subject: How the body could power pacemakers and other implantable devices
  (Charles Q. Choi)

  [From ocean wave motions to lungs!  Great idea.  PGN]

Charles Q. Choi, *The Washington Post*, 9 Jun 2018
http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/how-the-body-could-power-pacemakers-and-other-implantable-devices/2018/06/08/16d287b0-5559-11e8-a551-5b648abe29ef_story.html

In I Sing the Body Electric, poet Walt Whitman waxed lyrically about the
action and power of beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh.  More
than 150 years later, MIT materials scientist and engineer Canan Dagdeviren
and colleagues are giving new meaning to Whitman's poem with a device that
can generate electricity from the way it distorts in response to the beating
of the heart.

Despite tremendous technological advances, a key drawback of most wearable
and implantable devices is their batteries, whose limited capacities
restrict their long-term use. The last thing you want to do when a pacemaker
runs out of power is to open up a patient just for battery replacement.

The solution may rest inside the human body -- rich in energy in its
chemical, thermal and forms.

The bellows-like motions that a person makes while breathing, for example,
can generate 0.83 watts of power; the heat from a body, up to 4.8 watts; and
the motions of the arms, up to 60 watts. That's not nothing when you
consider that a pacemaker needs just 50 millionths of a watt to last for
seven years, a hearing aid needs a thousandth of a watt for five days, a
smartphone requires one watt for five hours.

Increasingly, Dagdeviren and others are investigating a plethora of ways
that devices could make use of these inner energy resources and are testing
such wearable or implantable devices in animal models and people.

Good vibrations

One energy-harvesting strategy involves converting energy from vibrations,
pressure and other mechanical stresses into electrical energy. This
approach, producing what is known as piezoelectricity, is often used in
loudspeakers and microphones.

To take advantage of piezoelectricity, Dagdeviren and colleagues have
developed flat devices that can be stuck onto organs and muscles such as the
heart, lungs and diaphragm. Their mechanical properties are similar to
whatever they are laminated onto, so they don't hinder those tissues when
they move.

So far, such devices have been tested in cows, sheep and pigs, animals with
hearts roughly the same size as those of people.  ``When these devices
mechanically distort, they create positive and negative charges, voltage and
current -- and you can collect this energy to recharge batteries, You can
use them to run biomedical devices like cardiac pacemakers instead of
changing them every six or seven years when their batteries are depleted.''

Scientists are also developing wearable piezoelectric energy harvesters that
can be worn on joints such as the knee or elbow, or in shoes, trousers or
underwear. People could generate electricity for electronics whenever they
walk or bend their arms.

Body heat

A different energy-harvesting approach uses thermoelectric materials to
convert body heat to electricity.  ``Your heart beats more than 40 million
times a year,'' Dagdeviren notes.  All that energy is dissipated as heat in
the body -- it's a rich potential source to capture for other uses.

Thermoelectric generators face key challenges. They rely on temperature
differences, but people usually keep a fairly constant temperature
throughout their bodies, so any temperature differences found within are
generally not dramatic enough to generate large amounts of electricity. But
this is not a problem if the devices are exposed to relatively cool air in
addition to the body's continuous warmth.

Scientists are exploring thermo-electric devices for wearable purposes, such
as powering wristwatches. In principle, the heat from a human body can
generate enough electricity to power wireless health monitors, cochlear
implants and deep-brain stimulators to treat disorders such as Parkinson's
disease.

Static and dynamic

Scientists have also sought to use the same effect behind everyday static
electricity to power devices. When two different materials repeatedly
collide with, or rub against, one another, the surface of one material can
steal electrons from the other, accumulating a charge, a phenomenon known as
triboelectricity. Nearly all materials, both natural and synthetic, are
capable of creating triboelectricity, giving researchers a wide range of
choices for designing gadgets.

Nanotechnologist Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Tech:

  ``The more I work with triboelectricity, the more exciting it gets, and
  the more applications it might have.  I can see myself devoting the next
  20 years to it.''

Subject: Having better risk-based analysis for your banks and credit cards

David Strom's Web Informant, 11 Jun 2018
  [TNX to Gabe Goldberg]

When someone tries to steal money from your bank or credit card accounts,
these days it is a lot harder, thanks to a number of technologies. I
recently personally had this situation. Someone tried to use my credit card
on the other side of Missouri on a Sunday afternoon.  Within moments, I got
alerts from my bank, along with a toll-free number to call to verify the
transactions. In the heat of the moment, I dialed the number and started
talking to my bank's customer service representatives. Then it hit me: what
if I were being phished? I told the person that I was going to call them
back, using the number on the back of my card. Once I did, I found out I was
talking to the right people after all, but still you can't be too careful.

This heat-of-the-moment reaction is what the criminals count on, and how
they prey on your heightened emotional state. In my case, I was well into my
first call before I started thinking more carefully about the situation, so
I could understand how phishing attacks can often work, even for experienced
people.

To help cut down on these sorts of exploits, banks use a variety of
risk-based or adaptive authentication technologies that monitor your
transactions constantly, to try to figure out if it really is you doing them
or someone else. In my case, the pattern of life didn't fit, even though it
was a transaction taking place only a few hundred miles away from where I
lived. Those of you who travel internationally probably have come across
this situation: if you forget to tell your bank you are traveling, your
first purchase in a foreign country may be declined until you call them and
authorize it. But now the granularity of what can be caught is much finer,
which was good news for me.

These technologies can take several forms: some of them are part of identity
management tools or multi-factor authentication tools, others come as part
of regular features of cloud access security brokers. They aren't
inexpensive, and they take time to implement properly. In a story I wrote
last month for CSOonline
<https://www.csoonline.com/article/3271134/authentication/how-risk-based-authentication-has-become-an-essential-security-tool.html%23tk.twt_cso
I discuss what IT managers need to know to make the right purchasing
decision.

In that article, I also talk about these tools and how they have matured
over the past few years. As we move more of our online activity to mobiles
and social networks, hackers are finding ways at leveraging our identity in
new and sneaky ways. One-time passwords that are being sent to our phones
can be more readily intercepted, using the knowledge that we broadcast on
our social media. And to make matters worse, attackers are also getting
better at conducting blended attacks that can cut across a website, a mobile
phone app, voice phone calls, and legacy on-premises applications.

Of course, all the tech in the world doesn't help if your bank can't respond
quickly when you uncover some fraudulent activity. Criminals specifically
targeted a UK bank that was having issues with switching over its computer
systems last month knowing that customers would have a hard time getting
through to its customer support call centers. The linked article documents
how one customer waited on hold for more than four hours, watching while
criminals took thousands of pounds out of his account. Other victims were
robbed of five and six-figure sums after falling for phishing messages
that asked them to input their login credentials.

<https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/05/28/scammers-drain-mans-bank-account-fraud-hotline/

The moral of the story: don't panic when you get a potentially dire fraud
alert message. Take a breath, take time to think it through. And call your
bank when in doubt.

What continues to bug me is that banks don't ask, ``Did you call this number
from the back of your card?''  Those of us who did will say ``Of course'',
but we aren't the ones to worry about. I've gotten calls from banks asking
me about transactions; when I said ``I will call you back'', they said
``Fine, of course.''  But they SHOULD have started the call with ``This is
TBTF Bank, calling about a questionable transaction on your Visa card. To
ensure that this is a legitimate conversation, please call us back at the
number on the back of your card.''

Subject: Re: Securing Elections (Shapir, R 30 71)

This is similar in Britain (not that I'm a constitutional expert).
Candidates stand for election in each electoral area, and we vote for which
one we want to serve as our Member of Parliament.  The winner is the one
with most votes -- the 'first-past-the-post' system.  Usually one of the big
parties gets a majority of MPs so forms the government directly, but
sometimes (as at the present time) the biggest party needs a support
agreement with a smaller party to get a majority.  While this may seem like
an elected dictatorship, it's obvious who is in charge, and we get the
chance to vote them out at the next election.

By contrast, as I understand it, mainland European countries often have a
large number of small parties so coalitions are the usual arrangement.  The
problem here is that much policy-making may be hidden in behind-the-scenes
deals between parties, i.e. a party may have to support something that it
doesn't want to get something that it does, or vice-versa.  This can give
unstable governments as in Italy as the original poster said, or the
opposite when an election just changes a few of the elected representatives
and everything continues as as before.  The EU seems to be based on the
European model, with a large bureaucracy notionally governed by a small,
unfocused elected assembly, which may account for the fractious relationship
between the UK and the EU; indeed, a cynic such as myself may feel that the
aim is to create the impression of democracy rather than giving power to
voters.

As British MPs are elected regionally, there's no direct correlation between
the total number of votes gained by parties and the numbers of their MPs, so
there are periodic campaigns to adopt some kind of proportional
representation system, though this brings various other problems.  A bigger
problem is potential voter-identity fraud, a frequent topic in RISKS.
There's talk of requiring voters to show some proof of identity at polling
stations, but what, as there's no particular official UK identity document?
