Subject: Texas Hospital blames software for ebola error (Fox/Johnson)

Maggie Fox and M. Alex Johnson, NBC News
The Dallas Hospital that mistakenly sent home a man who had ebola says
flawed software and not human error caused doctors to miss the diagnosis.
http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/texas-hospital-makes-changes-after-ebola-patient-turned-away-n217296

Health officials and local residents have been asking how the hospital could
have missed what would have appeared to be an obvious potential case of
Ebola: a Liberian citizen who said he recently traveled from Liberia, with
fever and abdominal pain.

``Protocols were followed by both the physician and the nurses,'' the
hospital said in a statement issued Thursday night.  The nurse who took
Thomas Eric Duncan's medical history did the job correctly, the hospital
said.  ``However, we have identified a flaw in the way the physician and
nursing portions of our electronic health records (EHR) interacted in this
specific case,''

``In our electronic health records, there are separate physician and nursing
workflows. The documentation of the travel history was located in the
nursing workflow portion of the EHR, and was designed to provide a high
reliability nursing process to allow for the administration of influenza
vaccine under a physician-delegated standing order. As designed, the travel
history would not automatically appear in the physician's standard
workflow.''  In other words, the nurse wrote that Duncan had come from
Liberia, but the doctors who examined him would not have automatically seen
that.  And they were not prompted to ask.  [...]

"Digital Investigation of Security Attacks on Cardiac Implantable Medical Devices"

In this paper, we propose a system for postmortem analysis of lethal attack
scenarios targeting cardiac IMDs. Such a system reconciles in the same
framework conclusions derived by technical investigators and deductions
generated by pathologists. An inference system integrating a library of
medical rules is used to automatically infer potential medical scenarios
that could have led to the death of a patient. A Model Checking based formal
technique allowing the reconstruction of potential technical attack
scenarios on the IMD, starting from the collected evidence, is also
proposed. A correlation between the results obtained by the two techniques
allows to prove whether a potential attack scenario is the source of the
patient's death. [...]

Subject: Should Airplanes Be Flying Themselves? (William Langewiesche)

  [From Dewayne Hendricks via Dave Farber]

Interesting at a number of levels in terms of human factor. Also something
to think about with the effort to automate driving.

The conclusion is that cockpit automation has made planes safer but has also
reduced the ability of pilots to act as a manual backup system in unusual
circumstances. Though the article didn;t mention it I can;t help but
think of the extreme example of the 767 that glided into a successful
landing in Canada.

The Human Factor, William Langewiesche, *Vanity Fair*, Oct 2014

Airline pilots were once the heroes of the skies. Today, in the quest for
safety, airplanes are meant to largely fly themselves. Which is why the 2009
crash of Air France Flight 447, which killed 228 people, remains so
perplexing and significant. William Langewiesche explores how a series of
small errors turned a state-of-the-art cockpit into a death trap. [...]

Subject: Y2K redux: Why thousands of 911 calls got lost

Y2K was about not expecting rollover; so too, it seems that a max counter of
40M 911 calls caused the routing system to discard calls coming over VoIP
phones.  Presumably the FCC report (which I have not read) has more details.

Some years ago, I worked for a software company whose software shut down
unexpectedly, when the date (which was stored as a decimal number since an
epoch) increased to require one extra digit.  No one had tried rolling the
clock forward (either in our development labs, or in any of our customer
sites) to see whether there it would continue working in the future.

We keep making the same mistakes...

Colin Lecher, The Verge, 3 Oct 2014
Our most important lifeline isn't always there when you need it

On a June morning in Washington, William Leneweaver, the state's E911 IT
projects and operations manager, was alerted to a call. A man had been
attempting to dial emergency responders, but he couldn't get through. He was
left listening to a "fast busy" - a pre-recorded tone.

Eventually, he made contact by borrowing someone else's phone. The staff of
the state's Vancouver call center, where the call was received, began
investigating what might have prevented the call from going through. They
made test calls with Sprint phones, the same provider the man had. No 911
service. They had someone in another location make more calls. Same problem.

Subject: Donald MacKenzie on high-frequency trading

A great article on high-frequency trading in the LRB.

'Be grateful for drizzle'
Donald MacKenzie, London Review of Books, 11 Sep 2014
http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n17/donald-mackenzie/be-grateful-for-drizzle

After recounting the collapse of Knight Capital in Aug 2012 (also
tracked in RISKS 26.97), he mentions a previously unreported incident:

  Such events don't always become public. In a New York coffeehouse, a
  former high-frequency trader told me matter-of-factly that one of his
  colleagues had once made the simplest of slip-ups in a program: what
  mathematicians call a `sign error', interchanging a plus and a minus. When
  the program started to run it behaved rather like the Knight program,
  building bigger and bigger trading positions, in this case at an
  exponential rate: doubling them, then redoubling them, and so on.  ``It
  took him 52 seconds to realise what was happening, something was terribly
  wrong, and he pressed the red button, stopping the program.  By then we
  had lost $3 million.'' The trader's manager calculated ``that in another
  twenty seconds at the rate of the geometric progression, the trading firm
  would have been bankrupt, and in another fifty or so seconds, our clearing
  broker -- a major Wall Street investment bank -- would have been bankrupt,
  because of course if we're bankrupt, our clearing broker is responsible
  for our debts; it wouldn't have been too many seconds after that the whole
  market would have gone.''

  What is most telling about that story is that not long previously it
  couldn't have happened. High-frequency firms are sharply aware of the
  risks of bugs in programs, and at one time my informant's firm used an
  automated check that would have stopped the errant program well before its
  human user spotted that anything was wrong. However, the firm had been
  losing out in the speed race, so had launched what my informant called `a
  war on latency', trying to remove all detectable sources of
  delay. Unfortunately, the risk check had been one of those sources.

After discussing the various techniques (lasers, microwave links along
geodesics, bare-metal programming, FPGAs, etc) in reducing latency
used in HFT, he says:

  If you're a certain kind of person, there's pleasure to be had in a lot of
  this. [...]  I confess that some of the pleasure rubs off on me. It's nice
  to study a domain of economic life that's so caught up with the physical
  world: with wind and rain and fog, tunnels and oceans and sharks; and with
  the geography of such unfashionable places as Aurora, Weehawken and
  Slough.

Highly recommended read.

Subject: Firedrive has gone down taking millions of files with it

The Cloud is a wonderful concept. Store and share your files around the
world, contribute jointly to documents or a project, upload your precious
files for safe keeping, etc., and whatever.

But what happens if the Cloud site that you are paying good money towards
goes down without notice effectively losing all of those files.?

That is what happened FIVE days ago to Firedrive.com.  Despite appeals for
information from worried users (or should I say customers?), the site is
well and truly down. Not that so-called "IsitUp" websites are reporting
this.  Apparently the Firedrive servers are up but the Firedrive file
storage system isn't and hasn't been for days.

The Firedrive Facebook account -- with about 66,000+ 'Likes' or 'Friends' --
is full of customers complaining that they cannot log in to get at their
files.

The scandal is that Firedrive's landing / home page says nothing about any
outage, there have been no warnings, no announcements, no apologies, no
emails, nothing but silence. Emails that do (supposedly) get through are
ignored.

The issue has yet to be picked up by the media.

Yet this is one of the biggest Cloud storage systems on the web. Yet it has
gone - taken with it everyone's files. And the owners remain silent.

Personally I have always been wary of the Cloud concept. Folks' files are
only as secure as a site itself. In the past few years we have seen a major
image hosting site suddenly disappear taking millions of images with it, and
then there was the close down of the file-sharing site in New Zealand.

Firedrive is apparently hosted by Cloudfare (who remain unhelpful when
emailed). And the owners of Firedrive and the whereabouts of the servers are
apparently scattered around the world with postal addresses in London
UK. Singapore, Spain, and the Bahamas (domain BS).

The risk? Hmm - eggs in one basket springs to mind. Something to avoid if
using the Cloud.

C.J.Brady (who has lost now hundreds of files from Firedrive to say nothing
of the time and money uploading them. Luckily I have a complete backup on
my computer -- I don't trust the Cloud and never will !!!).

Subject: Firedrive has gone down: more

This is now day 6 of Cloud storage Firedrive' massive outage. One customer
reports losing 6TB of files. And there has still been no communications from
the owners.

But Firedrive is hosted at the same IP address as Cloudfare. And Cloudfare
has its own problems.

See: https://blog.cloudflare.com/route-leak-incident-on-october-2-2014/

But I also understand that Firedrive has been taking payments under their
premium plan to host many customers' files. To suddenly remove those
services paid for without any communication is poor customer at best.

This reflects upon the integrity of both Cloudfare and Firedrive.

It also highlights the dangers and risks of using the Cloud (whatever that
is) for the remote storage of files.

  (Goldberg, R-28.29)

The flip side being if they had to repossess it due to nonpayment then
there would be no chance of her being able to use it in a timely manner.
With the remote shut down option she could for example have paid the
outstanding balance, or possibly phoned them and asked for a compassionate
exception (e.g., they re-enable it for an hour or something.

Also there is a potential upside of this: traditionally if you sold cars to
people who didn't have a lot of money (aka the poor), you ran a higher risk
of having to repossess the car for nonpayment, which meant having someone
track it down and tow it away (having seen an episode of Repo-men, this looks
like a total pain). With the remote disabler it becomes "safer" to sell cars
to riskier customers as you have easier recourse (just turn it off and send
someone to collect it if they continue to refuse payment). This technology
could make it safer to sell cars to people with riskier credit profiles.

On the other hand this tech could be used to justify selling cars with
financing to people with really risky credit purposefully like the NINJA (No
Income No Job) loans that were so popular during the mortgage crisis because
there's minimal downside to the lender/car dealer.

If I had to bet my money I'd put it on the less happy outcome.

Subject  Re: Remote automobile shutdown shuts down emergency-room visit

Legally, the liability of the automobile creditor sounds analogous to
utilities who shut off power because of nonpayment.  Electric or gas cutoffs
have resulted in death from time to time.  I presume that the risks date all
the way back to the 1800s birth of public utilities.

There must be analogous tragedies resulting from cutting off water, food
deliveries, even Internet connections that are similar from a legal point of
view.  I can imagine a repo man who specializes in fire trucks and
ambulances.  More extreme, I imagine a supplier who demands payment before
shipping biohazard supplies to West Africa.

The point is that there is no defined upper limit to the risk associated
with the consequences of nonpayment of bills.  I believe that the debtors,
not the creditors are usually liable for those consequences..

Today, many electric and gas utilities are required to observe all sorts of
safeguards to prevent tragic outcomes from service cutoffs. There are also
specific laws in some locations preventing software vendors from embedding
"self help" logic bombs in their programs.  But absent such specific laws,
there is no general liability that I am aware of.
