Subject: Vigilance device fooled by horn automation

This press release was issued in February, but I don't think it's been
mentioned in Risks.

  http://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/PR20150206.aspx

On August 17, 2014, two Union Pacific freight trains collided head-on at
Hoxie, Arkansas, killing the engine crew of one train and causing
considerable damage.  The NTSB hasn't yet announced a probable cause, but
they've found one thing that sure looks to me like a contributing factor: on
one of the trains, the vigilance device did not do what it was supposed to.

The vigilance device or "alerter" is the modern replacement for the
traditional dead-man control.  It's supposed to sound a warning if none of
the controls in the locomotive cab is operated for a certain length of time.
If the warning is not acknowledged after a further time, the brakes are
applied automatically.

In this case, though, one of the locomotives was equipped with a "horn
sequencer", with which a single press of a foot pedal would repeatedly sound
the standard level-crossing warning: long-long-short-long.  In this case, in
fact, the horn went on sounding for 4 minutes.

But as far as the alerter was concerned, each blast of the horn meant
that a control had been operated -- so it reset its timer.

Subject: TAFE students left in limbo by computer glitch

Seen in the Sydney Morning Herald 16th March (and online over at
http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/computer-woes-put-tafe-nsw-students-on-hold-over-fees-and-results-20150315-142o7t.html).

``Thousands of TAFE [Technical And Further Education] students are still not
  officially enrolled in their courses more than five weeks ago because of a
  a computer glitch. ... The [NSW] Department of Education has revealed that
  the new software is not functioning properly with its cost expected to
  blow out by $90 million.''

Basically, a system that was supposed to have been implemented by the end of
last year is simply not working, with students unable to access their grades
or fee notices, and teachers concerned about liability over accidents.

Testing?  What's that?

Subject: Facebook to introduce payments in instant messages (Vindu Goel)

Facebook's instant messaging service can now be used to transmit money, by
linking your debit card to the service.  Betting seems to suggest that this
is a first step toward a more general peer-to-peer payment system.

In that Facebook's Messenger app already has 500 million users each month,
plus their acquisition of WhatsApp with another 700 million users, RISKS
readers might well suspect that this could be a huge windfall for hucksters
and fraudsters.

Subject: Config error leaked Google whois data for 280K domains

Ars via NNSquad
http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/03/epic-google-snafu-leaks-hidden-whois-data-for-280000-domains/

  "Google leaked the complete hidden whois data attached to more than
  282,000 domains registered through the company's Google Apps for Work
  service, a breach that could bite good and bad guys alike.  The 282,867
  domains counted by Cisco Systems' researchers account for 94 percent of
  the addresses Google Apps has registered through a partnership with
  registrar eNom. Among the services is one that charges an additional $6
  per year to shield from public view all personal information included in
  domain name whois records. Rather than being published publicly, the
  information is promised to remain in the hands of eNom except when it
  receives a court order to turn it over.  Starting in mid 2013, a software
  defect in Google Apps started leaking the data, including names, phone
  numbers, physical addresses, e-mail addresses, and more. The bug caused
  the data to become public once a domain registration was renewed. Cisco's
  Talos Security Intelligence and Research Group discovered it on February
  19, and five days later the leak was plugged, slightly shy of two years
  after it first sprung."

As someone who feels that all WHOIS data should be fully public except in
exceptional circumstances (I've discussed why in the past), it's difficult
for me to get too worked up about this on that level -- but obviously if
you're told that information is private, it's important that it really is
private.

  One major problem - besides criminalising YouTube - is that "certain
  publications" aren't actually defined in the regulations, so they could
  apply to any news or website - so while it may be that the regulations are
  aimed at bringing streaming TV services inline with traditional broadcast
  TV, the wording could include any blog, news site or Facebook page run out

Subject: The problem with beacons ...

The problem with beacons is ``Is there a problem with beacons?''

Good question.

The Internet of Things is begging for infrastructure with potential. One
aspect of that potential is the beacon, considered by marketers to be the
"Next Frontier for Consumer Engagement", downloadable from
  http://www.beaconstac.com/ebook/ibeacons-for-consumer-engagement

Beacons emit an ID that can interact with your smart device (over
Bluetooth), but only if there is an app for the beacon.  Beacons can be
smarter that just emitting an ID, though I am not sure how smart, for
example it is claimed that the beacon can access GPS information only if GPS
is enabled.

There are known attacks, see "6 Myths around Beacon Security and Privacy"
http://blog.beaconstac.com/6-myths-around-beacon-security-and-privacy/, and
beacons have already been hacked, in a CES sponsored scavenger hunt, where
the beacon ID's were not encrypted in the app.  See
http://makezine.com/2014/01/03/reverse-engineering-the-estimote/

Basically the beacon is new ground for marketers, developers and hackers.

(I haven't downloaded the beaconstac SDK  to look at the API, though I have requested `beta' access, and may report more, later.)

The list of beacon products and vendors is growing:

Subject: As We Age, Smartphones Don't Make Us Stupid -- They're Our Saviors

              http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/001094.html

Throughout human history, pretty much every development or invention that
increased our information storage and management capabilities has had its
loud and voracious naysayers.

Around 370 BCE, both Socrates and Plato were already badmouthing the
written word as inherently inferior to in-person verbal dialogue. The
printing press, typewriter, telegraph, telephone, and Internet have
all been targeted as the presumed bringers of universal intellectual
decay.

So it comes as no surprise that when Web search engines appeared on
the scene -- to organize Internet-based information and make it widely
available -- much the same tired old attack arguments were trotted out
by the usual suspects, in the form of multitudinous "Google Is making
Us Stupid!" articles and similar varieties of vacuous commentaries.

The crux of most arguments against having quick access to information
seem to largely parallel the attempts not that many years ago (and in
some venues, still continuing) to routinely ban calculators from
physics and other similar subject tests, on the grounds that not doing
the math by hand was somehow -- perhaps in a moral judgment "You'll go
to hell!" kind of sense -- horribly cheating.

But unless the test you're taking is specifically one for mathematical
skills, the rote manual calculation process is practically worthless
compared with developing the necessary skills to actually analyze a
problem and determining appropriate methodologies for reaching correct
answers. Even a specific answer itself may often be far less relevant
in many contexts than development and analysis of appropriate problem
solving processes.

One wonders how many potentially brilliant would-be physicists with
wonderful analytic skills were sidelined into other professions simply
due to not having a knack for manual math.

With the rise of the mobile Net comes the latest incarnation of this
twisted saga, the "Are smartphones making us stupid?" meme. There
seems to be a new version of this one somewhere pretty much every few
days.

In a very real way the term "smartphone" in this context is being used
by detractors largely as a proxy for saying "Portable Google" -- as a
wireless retread of search engine criticisms.

However, in this case the critics are even farther off the mark than
usual, because smartphones not only don't reduce our intelligence,
they can be our saviors as we age.

Physiological studies show that our memory for much specific data
usually begins to decline at the ripe old age of -- 20. Yeah, pretty
depressing. But in contrast, our reasoning and analytic skills can in
many cases continue developing throughout our lives without limit, as
we integrate ever more experiences into the mix.

And here is where the smartphone (along with the vast information
ecosystem that supports it) really becomes something of a
technological miracle.

For there on your belt or in your purse is a little box that can act
as an almost limitless adjunct to your own memory, to your own brain.

Type on it, talk to it. Ask it questions, note its reminders.
Smartphones can provide us with very much the exact kind of
information that our brains gradually become less adept at recalling
past age 20 or so.

To argue that it's somehow wrong, somehow cheating or unethical or
unnatural, to use these devices and their supporting infrastructures
in this way, is itself as dumb and stupid as forcing a potentially
brilliant future physicist to drop out of school because you wouldn't
let them use a calculator.

Obviously, for smartphones to be most useful at all ages, issues of
accessibility become paramount -- matters for ground-up consideration,
not after-the-fact excuses. Input and output methodologies, font sizes
and contrast, all become especially important, since our vision
typically begins to decline at the same young age as our memory. These
are all relatively straightforward user interface design issues
though, given the will to deal with them appropriately.

It would probably be a pretty tough slog to get Plato comfortable with
smartphones. On the other hand, he's quoted as saying: "We can easily
forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is
when men are afraid of the light." And especially when it comes to
smartphones and the immense value they can bring to us throughout our
lives, only a fool would argue with Plato about that.

  your world"
W. W. Norton & Company 2015
ISBN 978-0393244816
Table of contents:  https://www.schneier.com/book-dg-toc.html

By the time this review is published, I predict that Schneier's book will
have been reviewed in multiple places and will have spent time on the NYT
bestsellers list so I'm not going to write yet another summary of the book.
What I am going to do is summarize what I liked about the book and why you
should read it, share it with your friends and even send copies to your
elected representatives.

We live in a world of data - it's harvested, stored, analyzed, reported and
used to make important decisions ranging from what ads your search engine
highlights to the security screening you face at the airport.  And, as the
Snowden revelations have shown, there's an extensive private/public
infrastructure dedicated to harvesting, storing and acting on data.

There's been a growing susurrus of concern about all this data gathering and
decision making but the details have always seemed too technical and remote
for a large majority of the people whose data is involved.  Schneier tackles
the issues in a clear, readable presentation that is accessible to the
general reader.

He organizes the book into three parts: the first ("The World We're
Creating") is a masterful summary of how intensive the harvesting of data
actually is and the economic incentives that drive it; the second ("What's
at Stake") delves into the societal implications of this surveillance-driven
world; and the third (What to Do About it) proposes ways this data-addiction
can be brought under control.

The first two parts of the book explain our surveillance culture in detail
and analyze the many false trade-offs (e.g., security vs. privacy) and
collateral impacts (such as the post-Snowden reduced competitiveness of US
products and services).  As in any such presentation, the author will have
to face the disbelief that such things are actually happening and Schneier
meticulously documents the sources behind his writing in a notes section
that occupies about a third of the book.

What really sets this book apart is not its detailed examination of how bad
things are, but rather the proscriptive actions for improving the situation.
Chapter 12 ("Principles") states the basic principles ("Security and
Privacy", "Transparency", "Oversight and Accountability", "Resilient
Design", "One World, One Network, One Answer") guiding the way forward in
dealing with our surveillance problem.  The angels are in the details, of
course, and Schneier spends the following three chapters spelling out how
governments, corporations and people can apply them.

This is a controversial book that will be both praised and vilified.  We owe
a debt of gratitude to Bruce for bringing these issues together in one place
and exploring them in a clear and understandable fashion.  Read this book.
Loan it to your friends.  Send copies to your elected representatives.  But
most importantly, think about the principles and apply them in what you do.
Our surveillance society was not built by a cabal of faceless monsters but
by talented professionals seeking to solve a set of problems.  We built this
system and we can also help change it.
