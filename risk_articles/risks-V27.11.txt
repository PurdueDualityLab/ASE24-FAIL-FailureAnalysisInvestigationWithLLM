Subject: How the US Air Force flushed a $1B software project down the drain
  (Randall Stross)

[Source: Excerpt from Randall Stross, *The New York Times*, 9 Dec 2012]

  "Signs that such comprehensive change could not, in fact, be done "at
  once" were visible last spring. Last April, Jamie M. Morin, assistant
  secretary of the Air Force, testified before a subcommittee of the
  Senate's Armed Services Committee about E.C.S.S.: "The total cost on the
  system is now over $1 billion," he said, adding, "I am personally appalled
  at the limited capabilities that program has produced relative to that
  amount of investment."  With the cancellation of the system last month, a
  spokeswoman said that the Air Force would continue to rely on its legacy
  logistics systems, some of which have been in use since the 1970s."

Subject: Iran shipping signals conceal Syria ship movements

Iranian oil tankers are sending incorrect satellite signals that confuse
global tracking systems and appear to conceal voyages made by other ships to
Syria, which, like Iran, is subject to international sanctions. ...  "It is
of course possible to manipulate or falsify information in these messages,"
said Richard Hurley, a senior analyst at IHS Fairplay, a maritime
intelligence publisher.  At least three Iranian oil tankers are transmitting
such false signals, effectively taking over the identity of Syrian-owned
vessels traveling between Syria, Libya and Turkey.  All the vessels in
question were registered in Tanzania.

Subject: Syria outage sheds light on U.S. Kill Switch concerns (Robert Lemos)

Syria and as many as 60 other countries are at a severe risk of being
disconnected from the Internet because of lack of redundancy in their
telecommunications connections to the outside world, according to a recent
Renesys report.  However, the report rated the United States, Canada, and
many Western European nations as "resistant to risk," while other countries
were rated at "significant" or "low risk" or being disconnected.  The
analysis found that concerns that an Internet "kill switch" could cut people
off are unwarranted in the United States, says Renesys' Earl Zmijewski.
"Syria is not the U.S., it is not Canada, and it's not Western Europe,"
Zmijewski says.  "There is no way to simply shut down connectivity."  The
analysis of the relative resistance of a country's network to disconnection
is based on the number of providers that connect to the outside world, not
the number of physical connections.  Renesys' James Cowie notes that
comments on the study indicate that most people were concerned about their
country's vulnerability to being disconnected.  "It's interesting that most
people who are suggesting modifications to (our) model believe that their
country is much more vulnerable to disconnection," Cowie says.  [Source:

Subject: 25-GPU cluster cracks every standard Windows password in <6 hours

  "The five-server system uses a relatively new package of virtualization
  software that harnesses the power of 25 AMD Radeon graphics cards. It
  achieves the 350 billion-guess-per-second speed when cracking password
  hashes generated by the NTLM cryptographic algorithm that Microsoft has
  included in every version of Windows since Server 2003. As a result, it
  can try an astounding 95^8 combinations in just 5.5 hours, enough to brute
  force every possible eight-character password containing upper- and
  lower-case letters, digits, and symbols. Such password policies are common
  in many enterprise settings. The same passwords protected by Microsoft's
  LM algorithm-which many organizations enable for compatibility with older
  Windows versions-will fall in just six minutes."

Of course, you need access to the hashes to do this.   If sites didn't
make stupid errors that exposed their hash files, this approach would
not be particularly useful in most cases.

The Diane Rehm Show, December 5, 2012
http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2012-12-05/illusion-online-security

The age of passwords is over. That's the claim made in this month's "Wired"
magazine. Most of us trust that a string of letters, numbers and characters
is enough to protect our bank accounts, e-mail and credit cards. But hackers
are breaking into computer systems and hosts of user names and passwords on
the Web with increasing regularity. And because so much of our personal
information is stored in the cloud, hackers can trick customer service
agents into resetting passwords. Some Internet companies say the trade-offs
-- convenience and privacy -- are necessary to protect our data. Privacy
advocates say that price is too high. Diane and her guests discuss the
illusion of online security and whether you can make your accounts harder to
crack.

High-Speed Traders Profit at Expense of Ordinary Investors, a Study Says
[PGN-ed; lots more to read]
http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/04/business/high-speed-trades-hurt-investors-a-study-says.html

A top government economist has concluded that the high-speed trading firms
that have come to dominate the nation's financial markets are taking
significant profits from traditional investors.  The chief economist at the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Andrei Kirilenko, reports in a coming
study that high-frequency traders make an average profit of as much as $5.05
each time they go up against small traders buying and selling one of the
most widely used financial contracts.

"The very idea that the ITU could obtain and exert major regulatory powers
over the Internet is a happy one only to dictators and others who believe
the Internet needs to be controlled. We've seen again and again what nation
states like Syria, China, Saudi Arabia and others do when they are unhappy
with online content or conversations. Even a hint that such censorship could
spread should be, and is, anathema to people who believe in fundamental free

United States ambassador to the meeting called "the most shocking and most
disappointing" of any he'd seen."

  ... Hurricane Sandy also exposed a significant flaw in the initial design
  of the emergency system. It would rely greatly on commercial cellphone
  networks, the same networks that failed during the storm when cell towers
  blew down, power equipment failed and backup batteries or generators were
  flooded. "To think that you can build a network that can withstand
  anything and everything that Mother Nature throws at it is a bit
  unrealistic," said Bill Smith, president of AT&T Network Operations. "It's
  not impossible, but it would be incredibly expensive." ...

Subject: How Smartphones Are Making Wallets Obsolete

Some people might cringe at the thought of putting a picture of an insurance
card on their phone, but if I lose my phone, there is a password to stop
someone from opening it. My wallet never came with a password.

There are a couple of things I still carry in my pocket, held together with
a money clip: the debit card and my driver's license. But I'm confident that
those, too, will someday disappear.

Soon enough, my phone will become my sole credit card, and the only thing
left in my pocket will be my driver's license. And at some point, the
government will enter the 21st century and offer a digital alternative for
that.

Or maybe I won't need a driver's license at all: when cars drive themselves
in the not-too-distant future, I'll be taking a nap while my car takes me to
work.

The growth of the Internet, social networking and mobile technologies has
transformed how Americans communicate and exchange information, but Congress
has lagged in updating federal privacy laws to safeguard digital
communications from inappropriate prying. Late last month, the Senate
Judiciary Committee approved a measure, proposed by Patrick Leahy, that
would significantly enhance the privacy protection given to e-mails.  The
bill, an amendment to the outdated 1986 law that now governs e-mail access,
the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, would require law enforcement
agents to get a search warrant from a judge in order to obtain e-mail
content from a communications service provider that holds private electronic
messages, photos and other personal records, like Gmail or Facebook.

Subject: Mobile Browsers Fail Georgia Tech Safety Test

  Michael Terrazas, *Georgia Tech News* (5 Dec 2012)
  [via ACM TechNews, 7 Dec 2012]

Georgia Tech researchers have found that mobile Web browsers are so unsafe
that even cybersecurity experts cannot detect when their smartphone browsers
have landed on dangerous Web sites.  "We found vulnerabilities in all 10 of
the mobile browsers we tested, which together account for more than 90
percent of the mobile browsers in use today in the United States," says
Georgia Tech professor Patrick Traynor.  The main issue is graphic icons
known as secure sockets layer (SSL) or transport layer security (TLS)
indicators, which alert users when their connection to the destination Web
site is secure and that the Web site they see is actually the site they
intended to visit.  Due to the small screen associated with most mobile
browsers, there is not enough room to incorporate SSL indicators as with
desktop browsers.  Displaying a graphical indicator that a site is secure in
a Web browser's URL field is on the security guidelines recommended by the
World Wide Web Consortium for browser safety.  "Research has shown that
mobile browser users are three times more likely to access phishing sites
than users of desktop browsers," says Georgia Tech researcher Chaitrali
Amrutkar.

Groups Warn Against Hasty Action on Internet Voting in Response to Long
Lines, Technical Glitches in November 2012

Washington, DC, In a letter delivered to President Obama and congressional
leaders this week, a broad coalition of experts, including congressional
representatives, elections officers and cyber security experts, is urging
the president and Congress to reject any calls for Internet voting. They are
warning officials that Internet voting remains a highly insecure option that
leaves our systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks and technical failures.

After voters across the country waited as long as seven hours to cast their
ballots and Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc on East Coast election systems
last November, lawmakers in Congress are introducing legislation to
facilitate the voting process in federal elections, and some parties have
expressed Interest in online voting.

``Internet voting seems like a great solution. But relying on the Internet
to transmit a vote means not only opening the election up to hackers and
malicious forces, but also giving up the right to vote anonymously,'' said
Barbara Simons, former president of the Association for Computing Machinery
and chair of the board of the nonpartisan Verified Voting.

Instead, Simons and dozens of other leaders in their fields are urging
Congress to use scanned-in paper ballots in federal elections.

``The lack of accountability in our election processes has put our democracy
at risk. That's why we urge Congress to adopt scanned paper ballots. They
are inexpensive, they can eliminate long lines because many voters can vote
simultaneously, and most importantly, they provide a paper trail that can be
verified, especially in the event that an election result is called into
question,'' [quoting Peter G Neumann]

The letter to the President notes that, had elections been too close to call
in the November contest, many jurisdictions that rely on electronic voting
machines would have had no way to verify whether their results were correct.

Subject: 10th International Conference on integrated Formal Methods (iFM 2013)

June 10 - 14, 2013 - Turku, Finland
http://www.it.abo.fi/iFM2013/

OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE

Applying formal methods may involve modeling different aspects of a system
which are best expressed using different formalisms.  Correspondingly,
different analysis techniques may be used to examine different system views,
different kinds of properties, or simply in order to cope with the sheer
complexity of the system. The iFM conference series seeks to further
research into hybrid approaches to formal modeling and analysis; i.e., the
combination of (formal and semi-formal) methods for system development,
regarding modeling and analysis, and covering all aspects from language
design through verification and analysis techniques to tools and their
integration into software engineering practice.

Areas of interest include but are not limited to:
- Formal and semiformal modeling notations
- Integration of formal methods into software engineering practice
- Refinement
- Theorem proving
- Tools; - Logics
- Model checking
- Model transformations
- Semantics
- Static Analysis
- Type Systems
- Verification
- Case Studies
- Experience reports

INVITED SPEAKERS include
- Jean-Raymond Abrial, Marseille, France
- Cosimo Laneve, University of Bologna, Italy
- Susanne Graf, VERIMAG, France
- Kim Larsen, Aalborg University, Denmark
