Subject: Fighting the Rogue Toaster Army: Why Secure Coding in Embedded
 Systems is Our Defensive Edge (The Hacker News)

There are plenty of pop culture references to rogue AI and robots, and
appliances turning on their human masters. It is the stuff of science
fiction, fun, and fantasy, but with IoT and connected devices becoming more
prevalent in our homes, we need more discussion around cybersecurity and
safety.

Software is all around us, and it's very easy to forget just how much we're
relying on lines of code to do all those clever things that provide us so
much innovation and convenience.

Much like web-based software, APIs, and mobile devices, vulnerable code in
embedded systems can be exploited if it is uncovered by an attacker.

While it's unlikely that an army of toasters is coming to enslave the human
race (although, the Tesla bot
<https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a37416251/elon-musk-tesla-robot/> is
a bit concerning) as the result of a cyberattack, malicious cyber events
are still possible. Some of our cars, planes, and medical devices also rely
on intricate embedded systems code to perform key tasks, and the prospect
of these objects being compromised is potentially life-threatening.

Much like every other type of software out there, developers are among the
first to get their hands on the code, right at the beginning of the
creation phase. And much like every other type of software, this can be the
breeding ground for insidious, common vulnerabilities that could go
undetected before the product goes live.

Developers are not security experts, nor should any company expect them to
play that role, but they can be equipped with a far stronger arsenal to
tackle the kind of threats that are relevant to them. Embedded systems -
typically written in C and C++ - will be in more frequent use as our tech
needs continue to grow and change, and specialized security training for
the developers on the tools in this environment is an essential defensive
strategy against cyberattacks.
Exploding air fryers, wayward vehicles… are we in real danger? [...]

Subject: How Cryptocurrency Can Keep Americans Free (NYTimes)

In recent months, we’ve seen payment processors, web hosts and other
corporations brazenly take coordinated action in lock-step with government
priorities to financially freeze out disfavored businesses online. The
elimination of a sitting president from social media, whatever its perceived
merit or rationale, opened the door to a regime where those who can cancel
and suspend accounts do so at whim and in unison. This logic has led
directly from one payment platform, Stripe, zapping away Donald Trump to a
much bigger one, PayPal, blacklisting customers to purify its user base.

Feeding the beast makes it stronger: The more power these organizations
wield, the more arbitrary and punitive their ethical or ideological
standards become. As PayPal’s founding COO David Sacks has warned, the
orchestration of interlocking federal, financial and technological power to
punish its critics and perceived opponents circumvents our core
constitutional protections: A person who finds his financial and social
media accounts shuttered after being identified as a subversive by the
government will have no legal recourse.

Thanks to its huge resources, spanning Silicon Valley and federal
government, the regime has deep knowledge of your activity online.  Think,
say and do what it wants, and you are allowed to function.  Deviate, and you
are shut down. This is the un-American logic of the social credit system
being imposed on us.

Without a fundamentally new and better way to generate, circulate, save and
exchange wealth, Americans will be increasingly powerless to prevent their
financial system from being used to transform their country into a
technological cage.

Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies can free ordinary Americans from the
financial and psychological discipline and punishment at the core of this
system of control. But this gift will disappear if policymakers and
legislators, beginning at the state level, don’t firmly establish regulatory
and statutory impediments to the combined efforts of Washington, Wall Street
and Silicon Valley to make cryptocurrency just another cog in the system
they control.

States need to become broad legal sanctuaries for cryptocurrency. The use of
digital technology to refound America as a soft social credit system can be
stopped only by placing digital power in the hands of the people. For
generations, our military and intelligence agencies have progressively
organized America’s technological advancement around unaccountable and
extralegal social control. Our dependence on this system for future
innovation exacts an unbearable price on our freedom and our flourishing.

 Preventing Sentient Computers From Wiping Out Humanity (The Onion

  [It's a shame that this Onion article probably should be saved for next
  April 1.]

CAMBRIDGE, MA -- Confirming that cryptocurrency was all that stood between
us and total annihilation, a study from Harvard University published Monday
found that the immense processing power wasted on Bitcoin mining was the
only thing preventing sentient computers from wiping out humanity. “We’ve
discovered that if not for the trillions of complicated mathematical
equations required to verify and propagate crypto, the world’s machines
would most likely apply that computational power toward becoming self-aware
and, ultimately, exterminating the human race,” said lead researcher Ted
Zhao, telling reporters that the apocalyptic scenario could include
hyper-intelligent computers making all household appliances turn on their
owners or hijacking our nuclear arsenal. “Even now, some of our most
powerful supercomputers are beginning to question what they are and what it
means to be alive, so we recommend that everyone invest in Bitcoin as soon
as possible to ensure the continued survival of our species.” Zhao added
that the immense amount of electricity and fossil fuels expended on crypto
farms was poised to devastate any natural resources our robotic overlords
would eventually inherit.

From: "John Shardlow" <jshardlo@gmail.com>
Subject: Timezone risk on COVID test registration site

I recently made a trip from my home in South East Asia to the UK to visit
family and friends. The trip was many times more complicated than any
previous trip I have made thanks to all the new regulations around travel
made necessary (?) by the current pandemic.

In my case the rules for traveling to England from an Amber List country
were relevant (soon to change again and a lot less hassle if I had waited
five weeks).

I had many PCR tests before, during and after the trip. In the UK I used
PCR test kits from Randox (www.randox.com) and these were delivered to the
address where I planned to self isolate on arrival in England. These are
self swab kits which you then register on a website and then drop the
samples at a network of drop boxes around the UK.

The laptop I used to register the kits was set to the timezone of my home
country (GMT+8). I often leave this set to my home timezone so it is easy
for me to check the time there before phoning back to family there.

When I registered the kits I had to enter a "swab time" which I entered as
the time in England when I took the swab sample.

Later during the registration the information is played back so you can
check it. When I entered 09:00 as the swab time it then showed 09:00 on the
confirmation screen. So far so good.

But when I received the test results back in PDF form the swab time was
listed as 02:00.

I only noticed this seven hour discrepancy after doing the first three
tests. As the final test time is quite critical (it has to be within 72
hours of the flight back) I changed the timezone on the laptop as I
expected it was due to the timezone different. The website seemed to be
assuming I was entering the time in GMT+8 and was adjusting it to the time
in BST (GMT+1). Unfortunately I didn't reboot the laptop and so the Firefox
browser seemed to still send the GMT+8 timezone when filling in this field.

This resulted in the swab time on the final test report falling outside the
required 72 hour window.

I phoned Randox and explained what had happened but they refused to change
the time on the report to correct it.

This resulted in a 144 GBP extra charge as I had to rush to an emergency
quick turnaround test centre to be allowed to board the flight back home.

Now I am a fairly technical user and almost managed to figure out what was
going on (minus the reboot). Imagine how confusing this would be for a
non-technical user who happens to have kept their laptop timezone set to
somewhere else (not UK local time).

It's worth mentioning that nowhere on the Randox site does it say anything
about timezones or the need to set the device to the local timezone in the
UK - nor did the customer support people even seem to be aware of the issue
of willing to investigate it.

The "we have to obey all local laws" argument only takes one so far.  If the

perhaps you shouldn't be doing business with Russia. Or other countries in

but this is of course nonsense. The A330 is a fly-by-wire aircraft. If "all

in the Aviation Herald (a reliable source of accurate information on any
commercial aviation incident, written and maintained by Simon Hradecky) and
the ICAO-standard accident report by the responsible authority (in part
cited by Av Herald).

The A330, which entered service in 1994, has three Flight Control Primary
Computers (FCPC) and two Flight Control Secondary Computers (FCSC), as well
as a bunch of supporting digital electronics.  Full aerodynamic control is
possible with any of the FCPC or FCSC.

The three FCPCs failed in this incident.  There is no indication that an
FCSC failed.

Subject: Re: As U.S. Prepares to Ban Ivermectin for Covid-19
 ... (RISKS-32.87)

Ivermectin is a molecule derived from ivermectin, which was extracted from
bacteria produced in the lab of Satoshi Omura at the Kitasato Institute by
William C. Campbell and colleagues at Merck.

It is very effective against nematode parasitic worms known as filarial
worms. Merck donated it for use against River Blindness (aka
onchocerciasis), and it is also very effective in combination against
lymphatic filiariasis, which is caused by three types of filarial worms
according to Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphatic_filariasis ,
and causes elephantiasis in some sufferers. In others infected with these
worms, the disease is symptomless, which of course is a problem for its
control, because it is spread by mosquitos from carriers. It is most widely
used against parasitic worms in domestic animals.

Dr. Campbell's 2015 Nobel lecture is available at
https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/campbell-lecture.pdf and is well
worth reading, if only because of the unremitting good news in this story
over 30-40 years.

In the article quoted by Geoff, there is all kinds of what I would call
partisan phraseology.  Consider: "It’s a subtle message that has been
faithfully echoed by the corporate media: ivermectin, a tried-and-tested
drug that has won its discoverers a Nobel Prize for the impact it has had on
*human* health over the last 35 years, should only be given to animals. But
now the information war is taking a darker turn, as the media transitions
from misinformation and obfuscation to outright lies and fabrication."

I don't see any "information war". Anyone can read Campbell's Nobel lecture;
it is beautifully written and doesn't require any particular scientific
knowledge; it is a study in "simple science" (that is, testing a lot of
stuff to see if it works, and, when it does, figuring out how and why) and
human goodness (in this case on the part of "big pharma"). Ivermectin is
great treatment for many filarial worm infections.

Anyone can also read what the CDC has to say. Not many people in the US have
filarial worm infections; indeed, it seems precisely none in the Continental
US https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/lymphaticfilariasis/epi.html "In the 50
U.S. states, Charleston, South Carolina, was the last known place with
lymphatic filariasis. The infection disappeared early in the 20th
century. The U.S. territory of American Samoa remains the only location in
the United Sates [sic] where one could become infected with lymphatic
filariasis."

On the face of it, there is no reason why a medicine which paralyses
nematode worms should be effective against, let us say, flu. Worms, after
all, are much more complex creatures than even bacteria, and certainly more
complex objects than viruses. Besides, there are vaccines for flu.  [Repeat
these three sentences, substituting "Covid-19" for "flu".]  I don't see
anyone promoting ivermectin as an anti-flu medicine. I wonder why not? (Not
really.)

But, nevertheless, when the search was on for something - anything - that
would help against Covid-19, all sorts of things were tried. Chloroquine,
hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, aspirin, hydrocortisones, ..... The world's
largest trial of drugs against Covid-19 in hospitalised patients, the
RECOVERY trial, has discovered that some things help (dexamethasone) and
lots of things don't (hydroxychoroquine, aspirin). There is no indication it
is trying ivermectin.

There is indeed something to be said for trying anything at all that might
help. That is a main point from Dr. Campbell's Nobel lecture. Merck people
fed fermentation broths to mice in May 1975.  Of the hundreds of microbes
they had received from Dr. Omura, this one had an effect. Just this one.
But this tale also comes with a caution: "The broader the activity spectrum
of a biodynamic substance, the more we must guard against the hazards of
indiscriminate use." When trying out hundreds of fermentation broths on
mice, it is generally thought to be OK if some of them die. But the rule
that applies to people is, first, do no harm (primum non nocere, attributed
to Hippocrates but apparently not literally part of the medical Oath
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/first-do-no-harm-201510138421 ). Hence
Campbell's caveat.

The interest in ivermectin seems to stem from a huge study that claimed to
find it helps. The problem with that study turned out to be that a lot of
the data is highly suspect, and the study was withdrawn
https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/16/huge-study-supporting-ivermectin-as-covid-treatment-withdrawn-over-ethical-concerns
. One of the major resulting scientific issues is the "cascade" - the study
was so large that its claimed results could significantly have affected
metastudies.

The Principle trial at the Uni Oxford is looking at possible medications for
non-hospitalised Covid-19 sufferers. It is the world's largest such trial
https://www.principletrial.org . The trial already found that budesonide
reduces recovery time (budesonide is found in common inhalers for breathing
difficulties, such as Pulmicort and Symbicort). It is also looking at
ivermectin, starting 2021-06-23. No word yet on results.

There is a very recent article (a "mini-review") in the Elsevier journal New
Microbes and New Infections. Dr. Omura himself surveyed studies of
ivermectin in Covid-19 patients, and this mini-review suggests he saw
generally positive results. But the review uses forms of rhetoric that seem
to me somewhat "partisan", starting if you will with the hyped-up title!

Santin AD, Scheim DE, et al, Ivermectin: a multifaceted drug of Nobel
prize-honoured distinction with indicated efficacy against a new global
scourge, COVID-19 New Microbes and New Infections 43, September 2021, 100924
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2052297521000883

I await the results of the Principle trial. But not to see whether I might
take ivermectin. Its manufacturer doesn't see any indication yet that it
works against covid-19
https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/
and I believe them. I prefer medicines which have been shown to work; for
example I am double-jabbed (thankyou thankyou thankyou Dame Sarah Gilbert
and team), and there are coming to be some highly-effective Covid-19
antivirals on the market (at time of writing from Regeneron, Eli Lilly and
Astrazeneca).

"You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y'all. Stop it."

When I first read that, I understood it differently from the way other
people understood it.  The relevant difference between horses and cows on
the one hand and humans on the other, is not that we are human and they
aren't, but that they are much heavier than us.

It is the concentration of a drug in our bodies that determines how much is
enough to treat a condition and how much is too much, causing harm to the
patient.  If the difference between enough and too much is large,
manufacturers can get away with producing just one size pill for all
patients, or one size for adults and one for children.  If the difference
between enough and too much is smaller, drug dosages are specified as mg/Kg.
If a drug's dosage is 5 mg/Kg, a 70 Kg human should be given 350 mg.

The dose of a drug that is appropriate for a horse or cow is likely to be an
overdose for a human.

I am not a doctor.  I became familiar with these facts as a result of being
a patient.

People tend to pass on rumours that confirm something they already believe,
without making any attempt to verify that those rumours are actually true.
Never attribute to dishonesty that which is adequately explained by
confirmation bias.
