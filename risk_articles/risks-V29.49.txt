Subject: SWIFT system software compromised in order to hide the Bangladeshi
   Bank fraud

SWIFT is the international clearing house for bank transactions, and is a
cooperative with 3,000 members.  One of its members, the state bank of
Bangladesh, Bangladesh Bank, recently lost $81m due to fraudulent
transactions using SWIFT systems.

SWIFT has said that some of its software was compromised on Bangladesh Bank
computers in order to cover up the $81m loss, which has led to the
resignation of the Bank's governor.

It seems that authorised access was used to perform the illegitimate
transactions, of which the logs (and thus the visible audit trail) were then
hidden somehow by malware.

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/26/international-bank-transfer-system-hacked-swift-group-admits

BAE systems has some information on malware involved in covering up the
fraudulent transactions, but the incident is not yet fully understood. BAE
apparently doesn't know how the fraudulent transactions were created and
processed. SWIFT says the fraudulent transactions were initiated through
authorised access to its systems.

Presidential primary apps can gather a lot of information and may expose
sensitive data.

The number of apps related to the presidential primaries has grown
considerably. These apps are more popular than ever, thanks mostly to Donald
Trump, according to our data. However, we want to remind users that
presidential primary apps can gather a lot of information and may expose
sensitive data. Most primary apps are unofficial and not affiliated with a
campaign, but even official apps have some data exposure, as we found by
looking at two primary candidate apps using the Norton Mobile Security with
Norton Mobile Insight app.

Subject: Trust in the Cloud Could Be Pinned to Online Scoring System
  (David Ellis)

David Ellis, University of Adelaide, 22 Apr 2016

University of Adelaide researchers have developed an online tool to help
build users' trust in the cloud.  "Trust management is a top obstacle in
cloud computing, and it's a challenging area of research," says University
of Adelaide professor Michael Sheng.  He attributes this lack of faith in
the cloud to minimal transparency, and the difficulty in knowing whether
cloud-based applications are malicious or genuine.  Sheng has been
developing Cloud Armor, which aims to show which cloud sites, applications,
or providers are more trustworthy than others.  "The basic concept behind
this is like the website Rotten Tomatoes, which is widely used by people to
review and rank films," Sheng says.  Cloud Armor relies on a "credibility
model," a crawler engine that scans all of the comments made on the Internet
about any aspect of the cloud, and the model determines what feedback is
credible and what is not.  "We've tested this with and without our
credibility model--without the model, some cloud applications receive a
maximum score of 100; but with the model, that score might only get to 50 or
60," Sheng says.

Subject: DARPA Is Looking for the Perfect Encryption App; It's Willing to Pay

Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, *Motherboard*, 22 Apr 2016

The Pentagon's blue-sky research program is looking for someone to create
the ultimate hacker-proof messaging app.  The "secure messaging and
transaction platform" would use the standard encryption and security
features of current messaging apps such as Signal, but also would use a
decentralized Blockchain-like backbone structure that would be more
resilient to surveillance and cyberattacks.  The goal of the U.S. Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is "a secure messaging system that
can provide repudiation or deniability, perfect forward and backward
secrecy, time to live/self delete for messages, one-time eyes-only messages,
a decentralized infrastructure to be resilient to cyberattacks, and ease of
use for individuals in less than ideal situations," according to a recent
notice for proposals.  DARPA wants "a public wall anyone can monitor or post
messages on, but only correct people can decrypt," says Frederic Jacobs, an
independent security researcher.  He notes one problem with this approach is
the structure would have higher latency and be harder to deploy at scale.
DARPA's effort also suggests the rise of encryption apps is inevitable.

"Yes, the alleged cost [of the San Bernardino iPhone hack] is staggering"

For the FBI to advertise that it paid $1.3 million for a single hack is part
of its cynical effort to secure increased funding for next year:

https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/fbi-budget-request-for-fiscal-year-2017

"$38.3 million for operational technology investments related to the Going
Dark initiative"

"$85.1 million to enhance cyber investigative capabilities"

"$27 million to leverage Intelligence Community Information Technology
Enterprise components and services within the FBI"

"$8.2 million to enhance surveillance capabilities"

"Overall, the FY 2017 request represents an *increase* of $703.6 million
over the FY 2016 enacted levels, including an additional $229.1 million for
salaries and expenses and $474.5 million for construction."

  [Note: The $1.3M figure was an estimate derived from a rather indirect
  statement from James Comey, and should be considered an imprecise
  estimate.  PGN]

Subject: Re: If Emoji Are the Future of Communication Then We're Screwed

There are (at least) two causes for the huge potential for miscommunication
using emoji:

(1) There are a huge number of different emoji: Unicode lists over 300 faces
  and gestures, from U+1F600 (GRINNING FACE) to U+1F574 (MAN IN BUSINESS
  SUIT LEVITATING), and over 1600 emoji in total.

(2) Copyright laws mean that every company has to, or believes that they
  have to, produce their own designs for each emoji character which are
  significantly *different* from everyone else's: in order to avoid
  copyright claims.  Also, each company wants to have their own "style" of
  emoji: even the country flags are.

Also some devices interpret the same code as a very different symbol: the
"yellow heart" on iOS (which I assume is U+1F49B YELLOW HEART) is
interpreted on Android as a red "hairy heart" (or perhaps "heart with black
spikes": this does not appear on the Unicode list).

The image received could be very different to the one sent:

Subject: Europe's Billion-Euro Bet on Quantum Computing
  (Anthony Cuthbertson)

Anthony Cuthbertson, *Newsweek*, 28 Apr 2016

The European Commission's (EC) just-announced Quantum Flagship project will
invest $1.13 billion over the next 10 years to place Europe "at the
forefront of the second quantum revolution" via quantum technology
development, according to an EC spokesperson.  The project seeks to
encompass not only quantum computers, but also quantum secure communication,
quantum sensing, and quantum simulation.  Scheduled to launch in 2018, the
Quantum Flagship is a response to the Quantum Manifesto urging substantial
quantum technology investment, which was endorsed by several thousand
individuals from industry, academia, and government institutions.  According
to the manifesto, quantum technologies will give birth to a "knowledge-based
industrial ecosystem," which will generate long-term economic, scientific,
and societal benefits.  ETH Zurich professor Matthias Troyer thinks Quantum
Flagship recognizes quantum technologies are ready to make the transition
from research labs to commercial and industrial applications "that within
the next decade will be able to perform tasks that classical devices are
incapable of."  Cambridge Quantum Computing CEO Ilyas Khan agrees with this
assessment.  "It has become increasingly clear that it is now only a matter
of a relatively short time before quantum technologies become of practical
importance at the strategic level for governments and large corporations,"
Khan says.

Subject: Workshop on Software Measures and Metrics to Reduce Security
 Vulnerabilities

We invite you to submit a position statement to a workshop on Software
Measures and Metrics to Reduce Security Vulnerabilities.
https://samate.nist.gov/SwMM-RSV2016.html

when: Tuesday, 12 July 2016, 9 am to 4:30 pm
where: NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, USA

The U.S. Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan seeks
to fundamentally alter the dynamics of security, reversing adversaries'
asymmetrical advantages. Achieving this reversal is the mid-term goal of the
plan, which calls for "sustainably secure systems development and
operation." Part of the mid-term (3-7 years) goal is "the design and
implementation of software, firmware, and hardware that are highly resistant
to malicious cyber activities ..." and reduce the number of vulnerabilities
in software by orders of magnitude.  Measures of software play an important
role.

Industry requires evidence to tell how vulnerable a piece of software is,
what techniques are most effective in developing software with far fewer
vulnerabilities, determine the best places to deploy countermeasures, or
take any of a number of other actions. This evidence comes from measuring,
in the broadest sense, or assessing properties of software. With useful
metrics, it is straight-forward to determine which software development
technologies or methodologies lead to sustainably secure systems.

The goal of this workshop is to gather ideas on how the U.S. Federal
Government can best use taxpayer money to identify, improve, package,
deliver, or boost the use of software measures and metrics to significantly
reduce vulnerabilities.  We call for position statements from one to three
paragraph long.  Position statements may be on any subject like the
following: * existing measures of software that can make a difference in
three to seven years, * means of validating software measures or confirming
their efficacy (meta-measurements), * properties in software that can be
measured, * standards (in both étalon and norme senses) needed for software
measurement, * cost vs. benefit of software measurements, * surmountable
barriers to adoption of measures and metrics, * areas or conditions of
applicability (or non-applicability) of measures, * software measurement
procedures (esp. automated ones), or * sources of variability or uncertainty
in software metrics or measures.

The output of this workshop and other efforts is a plan for how best the
U.S. Federal Government can employ taxpayer money to significantly curtail
software vulnerabilities in the mid-term.

The workshop will be at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  This workshop is open to all.
There is no cost to attend the workshop, but prior registration is required
to enter NIST grounds. No walk-in (on-site) registration is available.

A "position" may include articulations of a problem, an issue to discuss, as
well as a solution or opinion.  The program committee will review the
position statements, and invite some to make a presentation.  Position
statements will be published if agreed to by both the author and the program
committee.  Send statements to Elizabeth Fong efong@nist.gov by 22 May 2016.
