Jai Vijayan, Dark Reading, 8 Mar 2022, via ACM TechNews; 11 Mar 2022

Researchers at Forescout's Vedere Labs cybersecurity intelligence team and
CyberMDX cybersecurity service provider discovered seven vulnerabilities,
known collectively as "Access:7," in more than 150 Internet of Things (IoT)
devices made by more than 100 companies. Three of the bugs, rated critical,
allow attackers to gain full control of devices by remotely executing
malicious code. The remainder, rated moderate to high in severity, allow
attackers to steal data or execute denial-of-service attacks. The flaws were
found in multiple versions of PTC Axeda agent and PTC Desktop Server, which
are used in many IoT devices to enable remote access and management. All
versions of the Axeda technology below 6.9.3 are affected. PTC has released
patches for the vulnerabilities.

https://techxplore.com/news/2022-03-qa-legal-expert-tesla-autopilot.html

"Ultimately, these issues depend on how federal regulators like the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulate the vehicle.  They will have
to set a safety performance standard which the manufacturer has to satisfy
before it can commercially distribute the product as fully autonomous. The
question is where the regulators set that standard at, and I don't think
it's easy to get right. At that point there will be a good debate to be had:
Did they get it right or not? We're still a few years out. I think we'll all
be having these conversations in 2025."

Blame the regulators for a permissive AV liability standard that enables
wide-spread AV deployments? Regulators are subject to industry capture.  As
are legislators who author the laws that enable regulation. Campaign
contributions often speak at a higher volume than non-profit public health
and safety interests.

Recurrent, high-profile product and service outrage incidents across the
finance, aerospace, pharmaceutical, chemical, and medical device sectors
reveal that regulatory industrial capture, regulatory approval delegation to
industry contribute to spectacular brand disasters.

A product usage license, as stated via terms of service, universally assert
corporate indemnification: you, the customer, agree to hold the business and
its employees faultless for any untoward event (accident, death, errant
outcome) in exchange for a right to use the product or service. These
ubiquitous terms shield CxO product decisions that can boost profits, though
the business governance directive (and ensuing product modification, often
using technology-based substitutes) may elevate public health and safety
risks.

Federal and state justice officials hesitate to pursue criminal remedies,
and frequently defer criminal prosecution in exchange for civil penalties,
settlements, and enhanced business monitoring.  Indemnification usage
restrictions might deter profit pursuit at the expense of public health and
safety.

Public suspicion about regulatory oversight and enforcement effectiveness,
and generally diminished trust in expertise, swells skepticism. Look no
future than the consumer marketplace to reaffirm doubt.

Subject: Finnish govt agency warns of unusual aircraft GPS interference
 (BleepingComputer)

Finland's Transport and Communications Agency, Traficom, has issued a
public announcement informing of an unusual spike in GPS interference near
the country's eastern border.

The origin of the interference remains unknown, but based on numerous
reports submitted to the agency from various sources, it has started during
the weekend and is still ongoing.

This has resulted in issuing NOTAMs (notices to airmen) to raise pilot
awareness and help them take additional measures to keep flights safe.

Matthew Sparkes, *New Scientist*, 8 Mar 2022,
via ACM TechNews; 11 Mar 2022

Ward Beullens at IBM Research Zurich in Switzerland easily cracked a
cryptography algorithm touted as one of three contenders for a global
standard against quantum hacking. Rainbow is a signature algorithm submitted
to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s
Post-Quantum Cryptography competition, and Beullens extracted Rainbow's
secret key from a public key in just 53 hours on a standard laptop. He said
this flaw would enable attackers to wrongfully "prove" they are someone
else, rendering Rainbow "useless" for message verification. NIST's Dustin
Moody said the Rainbow hack had been confirmed, and the algorithm will not
likely be selected as the final signature algorithm.

Subject: How People Actually Make Money From Cryptocurrencies (WiReD)

For many crypto[currency] traders who are in it for the medium to long haul,
there are some other ways to make money on cryptocurrency that's just
sitting in your crypto-wallet: staking and yield farming on DeFi networks.
DeFi is just a catchall term for *decentralized finance* -- —pretty much all
the services and tools built on blockchain for currencies and smart
contracts.

And, as with any type of digital network, DeFi services are vulnerable to
hacking, bad programming, and other glitches and problems beyond your
control. Getting good, consistent yields may require more work than you're
willing to do [...] watching the value of tokens and jumping from one type
of yield farm to another can get good results, but it's not unlike trying to
time the stock market. It can be very risky and could require more luck than
skill.

  What could possibly go wrong?

Security researcher Max Kellermann recently disclosed his discovery of the
Dirty Pipe Linux bug, which lets local users obtain root privileges through
publicly available exploits, and impacts Linux Kernel 5.8 and later
iterations, even on Android devices. He released a proof-of-concept exploit
that allows local users to inject their own data into sensitive read-only
files, stripping restrictions or tweaking configurations to expand their
access privileges. Kellermann alerted various Linux maintainers about Dirty
Pipe beginning Feb. 20, and although it has been corrected in Linux kernels
5.16.11, 5.15.25, and 5.10.102, many servers still are running outdated
kernels.

Subject: Docker, cgroups and the farce of SELinux (Bugzilla)

News emerged of a potential container escape.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2051505

Quay helpfully reviewed this and noted that SELinux seems to provide
protection from the vulnerability.

Unfortunately common behavior is to disable security features for
containers. The presence of btrfs was enough to cause Docker to fail to
attempt to launch at all with SELinux enabled.

https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/7952 (now closed)

RedHat themselves even provide instructions to disable SELinux on Podman (a
container orchestrator).

https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/podman-inside-container

High-level security advice for all servers has been "use MAC" for many years
to enforce process isolation and limit the scope of unknown vulnerabilities.
Virtualization is a hard problem to solve with process isolation
enforcement, but it is doable. Containers don't want to be marketed as
virtualization services, but they are. Everything you need to know to run a
virtualization service applies to a container service, and unlike
virtualization, containers are not practicing process isolation.

SELinux profiles use the MAC label "container_file_t" for permission
constraints on the container host.

https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/privileged-flag-container-engines

This label may be incorrectly applied to system level resources manually
due to poor user advice.

It would behoove container users to ensure that a MAC is in place (SELinux,
AppArmour, seccomp), is in enforce, and is scoped to processes in the
container execution environment and that the containers haven't been over
granted permission (like CAP_SYS_ADMIN), or granted access to files that
should have been protected by misapplied labels.

These opinions are my own and may not represent those of my employer.
I do not require attribution.  [Unusual, but Apparently Required,  PGN]

In November, Calvin Ridley violated a sacrosanct rule of professional sports
with an ease that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago.  With a
few taps of his smartphone while in Florida, away from his team, the Atlanta
Falcons wide receiver placed a series of bets, which the NFL later detected
and punished him for this week with an indefinite suspension.  [...]

Companies such as Genius Sports and Sportradar, which formerly worked with
the NFL and is still in business with MLB, the NHL, the NBA and other
leagues, monitor betting patterns and search for inconsistencies.  They have
technology that can spot unusual patterns, and then a human analyst
determines whether they can be explained -- a changed forecast or reported
injury, for example -- or whether the league needs to be alerted, said Andy
Cunningham, the director of global partnerships for Sportradar's Integrity
Services.

Those systems, which involve cameras and sensors, can also be used to

In particular, I don't recall any mention at the time of the possibility of
the sort of multi-megaton-equivalent explosion that was successfully avoided

This brings me back to today. If something were to happen to the operators
of the Chernobyl (or other ex-Soviet reactors), would these reactors be
capable of shutting themselves down automatically in a 'safe' way?

It appears that any of these plants have the possibility of wreaking a lot
more havoc than the 'small' 'tactical' battlefield nukes that are frequently

Consumers can't use the app pre-sale, but most Internet sales involve either
credit cards or a payment app like PayPal. When the drug arrives they can
check it with the app. If it's fake, they return it. If their payment isn't
refunded, they can go to the card issuer or PayPal etc.  and get their money
back that way.

As for law enforcement: if the thing comes into their hands legitimately,
they can test it. So if they buy some drugs and test them, that's perfectly
okay under search and seizure. Only if they took it away from somebody who
had bought it would they run into S&S problems.

If a non-anonymous solution is available, bad actors will try to find ways
to force people who shouldn't be using into using it. This will happen both
at a policy level and an individual level.

At a policy level, a bad-guy politician will minimize availability of
anonymous voting in order to allow peer-pressuring of smaller populations
into either not voting or voting for the bad guys. In an area that's close,
this kind of thing could easily swing elections.

At an individual level, you can easily envision an abusive spouse forcing
the victim to vote how the spouse wants. Right now the best the abuser can
do is force the victim to not vote, with non-anonymous voting they can
actually force the spouse to vote for the abuser's preferred candidate.

And if you think the policy level thing won't happen, I invite you to review
the last few years of controversy over polling places in parts of the US --
there's plenty of evidence that bad guys will try to prevent minorities from
voting if they can manage it.

What is missing is that if anonymity becomes an option, the choice of
anonymity is not anonymous!

This means that if someone is bullied into voting in a certain way, they
might also be bullied into using the non-anonymous option to vote by.

1. It shouldn't be forced on people, but it's not just the government that
   might wish to force it on people. In a relationship where a dominant
   member who wants others in the relationship to vote his choices instead
   of their own choices, this again allows him/her to insist that they use
   the non-anonymous voting system.

2. In an all anonymous system vote buying is hampered by the inability of
   the buyer to know whether the votes stayed bought. With your proposal the
   buyer can tie payment to seeing the vote.

It may be convenient for you, but it also may have negative consequences for
democracy.

Subject: MMS spam?

I have been receiving a lot of MMS (as opposed to SMS, normal text) messages
on my phones recently.  One of the phones doesn't have a data plan, so I
don't get to see what the messages are.  (Yes, yes, I *know* the cell
companies promise that their plans allow you unlimited voice, video, and
pictures "text" messages.  They lie.)  I have generally despaired of trying
to get people to realize the difference between SMS and MMS messages, and
the incompatibilities that make MMS messages unreliable even if you do have
the phone and cell/mobile data plan to support them.

However, a few days ago I got an MMS message from someone who *is*
technically competent, and, when I challenged him, he denied sending any
such message.  Given that he would know, and the increase in numbers, I am
wondering if there is some new spamming campaign utilizing MMS messages.

Anybody heard/seen anything along these lines?
