RISKS includes numerous discussions of air travel risks, from
vulnerabilities in airplane software, to crashes in airline reservation
systems, pricing errors, etc.  This one is more mundane -- a bug in American
Airlines' pilot scheduling software allowed too many pilots to request
vacation during the busy holiday travel season.  The result is not enough
pilots to fly all the scheduled flights, although the airline and unions
disagree on how many flights will be affected.

Subject: Claims container ship's navigation system "hacked"

[UK news service]

Hackers took 'full control' of container ship's navigation systems for 10
hours

In February 2017 hackers reportedly took control of the navigation systems
of a German-owned 8,250 teu container vessel en route from Cyprus to
Djibouti for 10 hours. "Suddenly the captain could not manoeuvre," an
industry source who did not wish to be identified told Fairplay sister title
Safety At Sea (SAS). "The IT system of the vessel was completely hacked."

There are three German shipowners that operate eight vessels between 8,200
and 8,300 teu, according to IHS Markit data, one of which confirmed
knowledge of the attack to SAS but denied it was a vessel from their own
company.

While details are limited, according to the source, the 10-hour attack was
carried out by "pirates" who gained full control of the vessel's navigation
system intending to steer it to an area where they could board and take
over. The crew attempted to regain control of the navigation system but had
to bring IT experts on board, who eventually managed to get them running
again after hours of work.

  Tens of thousands, perhaps millions, of Google Chromebooks, widely prized
  by schools due to their low cost and ease of configuration, were reported
  to be offline for several hours on Tuesday. The apparent cause? A
  seemingly botched WiFi policy update pushed out by Google that caused many
  Chromebooks to forget their approved network connection, leaving students
  disconnected.

I agree: Requiring large fleets of Chromebooks to be manually re-associated
with their Wi-Fi networks cannot be called a practical solution. And of
course, most Chromebooks have never been on Ethernet since most people don't
have the requisite USB<->Ethernet adapters.

  Another former Facebook executive has spoken out about the harm the social
  network is doing to civil society around the world. Chamath Palihapitiya,
  who joined Facebook in 2007 and became its vice president for user growth,
  said he feels "tremendous guilt" about the company he helped make. "I
  think we have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of
  how society works," he told an audience at Stanford Graduate School of
  Business, before recommending people take a "hard break" from social
  media.  Palihapitiya's criticisms were aimed not only at Facebook, but the
  wider online ecosystem. "The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops
  we've created are destroying how society works," he said, referring to
  online interactions driven by "hearts, likes, thumbs-up." "No civil
  discourse, no cooperation; misinformation, mistruth. And it's not an
  American problem -- this is not about Russians ads. This is a global
  problem."

Jim Finkle, Reuters
https://reut.rs/2AGTjhA

(Reuters) -- Hackers likely working for a nation-state recently invaded the
safety system of a critical infrastructure facility in a watershed attack
that halted plant operations, according to cyber-investigators and the firm
whose software was targeted.

FireEye Inc (FEYE.O) disclosed the incident on Thursday, saying it targeted
Triconex industrial safety technology from Schneider Electric SE (SCHN.PA).

FireEye and Schneider declined to identify the victim, industry or location
of the attack. Cybersecurity company Dragos said the hackers targeted an
organization in the Middle East, while a second firm, CyberX, said it
believe the victim was in Saudi Arabia.

It marks the first report of a safety system breach at an industrial plant
by hackers, who have in recent years placed increasing attention on breaking
into utilities, factories and other types of critical infrastructure,
cyber-experts said.

Compromising a safety system could let hackers shut them down in advance of
attacking other parts of an industrial plant, potentially preventing
operators from identifying and halting destructive attacks, they said.

Safety systems could be fooled to indicate that everything is okay even as
hackers damage a plant, said Galina Antova, co-founder of cybersecurity
firm Claroty.

  (Fortune)

Help is in sight for that batch of early-Bitcoin-adopters who are sitting on
untapped bounties because they've forgotten the passwords needed to get into
their wallets.

A hypnotist in South Carolina has recently begun offering to help people
recall forgotten passwords or find misplaced storage devices. Jason Miller
charges one bitcoin plus 5% of the amount recovered -- though he claims that
rate is flexible.

``I've developed a collection of techniques that allow people to access
older memories or see things they've put away in a stashed spot,'' he told
*The Wall Street Journal*.

A number of investors who bet on Bitcoin years ago are now in a painful
limbo. In the way that bank accounts are protected by passwords, Bitcoin
wallets that use keys to transact are also typically guarded by complex
security codes. However, unlike a bank, Bitcoin has no central hotline to
call for a reset.

Subject: Many Consumers Lack Understanding of Basic Cyber-Hygiene (Tenable)

New Study: Data breaches have been a headache for many years and for a long
time there seemed to be a general apathy about them. Our sense was that
things may have changed in the wake of the most severe breach ever -- the
theft of 145 million social security numbers and other sensitive data from
Equifax -- which leaves most Americans with the burden of having to monitor
for identity theft for the rest of their lives.

Against this backdrop, we decided to find out how aware Americans are of
cybersecurity threats and risks, how concerned they are about getting their
information stolen, and what they might be doing, or more importantly, not
doing about it. We also wanted to learn if recent breaches have caused
Americans to change their behavior at all. Tenable recently commissioned a
survey, conducted online by Harris Poll of more than 2,000 U.S. adults, to
determine how data breaches -- and media attention around them -- are
impacting consumers' perceptions about their online security and their
behavior.

McLean-Based Hilton to Begin Rolling Out High-Tech "Connected Rooms" McLean,
Va. -- *Hilton*, the McLean-based hospitality giant, said on Thursday it
plans to begin rolling out what it calls "connected rooms" -- high-tech
guest rooms that let users control most aspects of their stay from their
mobile device. Currently in beta testing, the concept will allow guests to
use their Hilton Honors app to manage most things they would traditionally
do manually, from controlling the temperature and lighting to the TV and
window coverings. Users also will be able to load the most popular streaming
media and other accounts to in-room TVs.  In the longer-term, Hilton said
that guests will be able to use voice commands to control their room or
access their content, and to upload their own artwork and photos to display
on walls. "The technology we put in hotel rooms has to be intuitive, simple
and quick to pick up because guests typically spend a limited amount of time
in their rooms," said Joshua Sloser*, the company's senior vice president of
digital product.  Hilton said it will begin scaling the concept rapidly to
hotels across the United States over the coming weeks.

Researcher Kate Crawford delivered an incredible keynote speech, titled The
Trouble with Bias, at Spain's Neural Information Processing System
Conference on Tuesday. In Crawford's keynote, she presented a fascinating
breakdown of different types of harms done by algorithmic biases.

As she explained, the word "bias" has a mathematically specific definition
in machine learning, usually referring to errors in estimation or over/under
representing populations when sampling. Less discussed is bias in terms of
the disparate impact machine learning might have on different populations.
There's a real danger to ignoring the latter type of bias.  Crawford details
two types of harm: allocative harm and representational harm.

``An allocative harm is when a system allocates or withholds a certain
opportunity or resource,'' she began. It's when AI is used to make a certain
decision, let's say mortgage applications, but unfairly or erroneously
denies them to a certain group. She offered the hypothetical example of a
bank's AI continually denying mortgage applications to women. She then
offered a startling real world example: a risk assessment AI routinely found
that black criminals were a higher risk
<https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing>
than white criminals. (Black criminals were referred to pre-trial detention
more often because of this decision.)

Subject: Improving election integrity/security/??? (Politico)

ACTION AT LAST ON ELECTION SECURITY? -- After months of debate but little
action, there appears to be a modicum of momentum building on Capitol Hill
to address some of the security shortcomings that voting integrity experts
say threaten to undermine the upcoming midterm elections.  Several lawmakers
made public pleas for movement on Friday and a bipartisan group of senators
are expected to drop an election security bill this week.

THE BILL: The upcoming legislation is aimed at greasing the
information-sharing channels that connect the Homeland Security Department,
the intelligence community and state election offices.  Election officials
said an inability to effectively swap data on hacker threats during the 2016
election left many in the dark about the digital invaders that were probing
the country's election networks. The proposed bill -- backed by Republicans
Sens. Lindsey Graham and James Lankford, as well as Democrats Sens. Kamala
Harris and Amy Klobuchar -- would also earmark additional resources for
states to bolster their digital defenses, according to an aide to one of the
lawmakers. The group is eager to get the legislation passed before the 2018
midterm primaries, the aide said.

Catalin Cimpanu  5 Dec 2017
Germany Preparing Law for Backdoors in Any Type of Modern Device

German authorities are preparing a law that will force device manufacturers
to include backdoors within their products that law enforcement agencies
could use at their discretion for legal investigations.  The law would
target all modern devices, such as cars, phones, computers, IoT products,
and more.

Officials are expected to submit their proposed law for debate this week,
according to local news outlet RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).

Difficulties in investigating modern crime, terrorist attacks

The man supporting this proposal is Thomas de Maizière, Germany's
Interior Minister, who cites the difficulty law enforcement agents have had
in past months investigating the recent surge of terrorist attacks and other
crimes.

The Interior Minister says that police officers are having a hard time
investigating cases because smart devices are warning owners before officers
could do anything about it.  The Minister cites the cases of smart cars that
alert an owner as soon as the car is shaken, even a little bit.  He says
he'd like police to be able to intercept that warning and stop it when
investigating a case.

De Maizière claims that companies have a "legal obligation" to introduce
backdoors for the use of law enforcement agencies and he also wants to
require the industry to disclose its "programming protocols" for future
analysis.  This latter clause could allow German officials to force
companies to disclose details about their encrypted communication practices.

German officials want "Hack Back" clause

Furthermore, the new law would also give German officials powers akin to the
"Hack Back" bill proposed in the US, allowing authorities the power to hack
any remote computer.  The Minister says this is important to "shut down
private computers in the event of a crisis," such as is the case with botnet
takedowns.

But privacy advocates who also read the new law proposal say the text also
contains verbiage that would allow the German state to intercept any traffic
on the Internet [1, 2], effectively setting up a surveillance state with
full snooping powers over everyone's online communications.  Experts called
for caution before approving the new law, which could be abused in its
current state.

German authorities anticipated such reaction and said that any access to
such data would be allowed only after law enforcement have obtained a court
order.  But the problem with encryption backdoors is not how you access
them, but that they exist in the first place and that they could be abused
by ill-intent actors as well.

Concerted efforts to weaken encryption across the globe

The law proposal is not a surprise for people who've been keeping an eye on
such things.  There are concerted efforts going on in Germany, France, and
the UK to introduce legislation for mandatory encryption backdoors.  In
fact, de Maizière and his French counterpart even signed a joint letter
they sent to the European Commission that supported encryption backdoors.

Similarly, the fight for encryption backdoors has been recently reopened in
the US as well, after a series of comments made by US Deputy Attorney
General Rod Rosenstein.

While the EU was very clear it does not intend to support the introduction
of laws that allow for generic encryption backdoors, in March 2017, the
European Commission offered its support for a plan that would allow law
enforcement to access data exchanged via encrypted instant messaging
services, such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, and others.

More than a third of U.S. federal websites are missing key elements of

Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF).

Out of 469 government websites surveyed by ITIF, just 36% passed the test

certificates.

These two security features are crucial elements of online security, without
which browsing can be insecure.  Federal government websites still require

Subject: Researchers craft Android app that reveals to find horrific
  menagerie of hidden spyware; legally barred from doing the same with iOS
  (Cory Doctorow)

Cory Doctorow, BoingBoing, 25 Nov 2017
<https://boingboing.net/2017/11/25/la-la-la-cant-hear-you.html>

Yale Privacy Lab and Exodus Privacy's devastating report on the dozens of
invasive, dangerous "trackers" hidden in common Android apps was generated
by writing code that spied on their target devices' internal operations,
uncovering all manner of sneaking trickery.

it would be great if we had effective regulatory oversight and the power to
seek legal relief from these companies for lying to us and/or sneaking
spyware into our lives; but every bit as important is the right to
independently audit their actions (as Privacy Lab and Exodus have done) and
to install code that overrides the undesirable functions of this spyware --
for example, by blocking its communications or chaffing it with plausible
garbage data.

The Exodus Privacy app's functionality is key to attaining the first goal ,
gathering independent evidence about the conduct of mobile firms and app
providers. Without that evidentiary basis, there's no way to know you need
self-help measures, nor is there any way to convince regulators to take
action, nor is there the possibility of creating public clamor for
competing products that would spur investors and entrepreneurs to make tools
that let you reclaim control over your device.

As Exodus and Yale note, these trackers are almost certainly also present in
iOS: the companies that make them advertise their iOS compatibility, for one
thing. But iOS is DRM-locked and it's a felony -- punishable by a 5-year
prison sentence and a $500,000 fine for a first offense in the USA under
DMCA 1201, and similar provisions of Article 6 of the EUCD in France where
Exodus is located -- to distribute tools that bypass this DRM, even for the
essential work of discovering whether billions of people are at risk due to
covert spying from the platform.

It's true that the US Copyright Office gave us a soon-to-expire exemption to
this rule that started in 2016, but that exemption only allows Exodus to use
that tool; it doesn't allow Exodus to make that tool, or to distribute it so
independent researchers can investigate iOS.

A trivial-to-exploit flaw in macOS High Sierra, aka macOS 10.13, allows

The security bug can be triggered via the authentication dialog box in
Apple's operating system, which prompts you for an administrator's username
and password when you need to do stuff like configure privacy and network
settings.

If you type in "root" as the username, leave the password box blank, hit
"enter" and then click on unlock a few times, the prompt disappears and,
congrats, you now have admin rights. You can do this from the user login
screen.

The vulnerability effectively allows someone with physical access to the
machine to log in, cause extra mischief, install malware, and so on. You
should not leave your vulnerable Mac unattended, nor allow remote desktop
access, until you can fix the problem. [...]

Straits Times, 19 Dec 2017
http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/simulation-facility-to-test-new-mrt-signalling-system

  "A simulation facility will be built for the East-West Line's (EWL) new
  signaling system to undergo extra tests before it is rolled out, in a
  move to beef up safety and not disrupt train services. The facility will
  be set up by French firm Thales, which aims to deliver the new signaling
  system for the EWL by next June. It is the first of its kind testing
  facility outside Toronto and Paris, where the firm is based."

Given Thales' prior release history, is it advisable to build the stack, and
also build the simulation?  Recall 
http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/7/64#subj5.1Â and Richard Feynman's
appendix on the Challenger disaster for the Roger's Commission.

Wow! Talk about using human guinea pigs. Seems like a page from corporate
control fraud: Build a product and sell it with impunity. The newspaper
publication trail does not reproduce the statement of work. I wonder what
the SMRT procurement team was thinking when they signed- off? Did they ask
to review Thales content for: test plan, prior release defect escape
density, prior test results, wall clock to qualify any candidate change?
Life cycle practices to preserve integrity and publication viability of
intellectual property? Did the procurement team consult software release
subject matter experts? 

Where's the "wall" between development and test? Certain subject matter
needs to be communicated -- like a common specification -- to enable
development and qualification. As engineering is cooperative activity, ideas
must circulate to create better ones. Will the same stack developers also
participate by building the simulation stimulus -- test programs? Does
Thales' new (to Singapore) signaling system simulation environment
accommodate editorial tension?

Ideally, "test author" v. "stack author" is applied to create and generate
editorial tension for qualification within a software factory.  Editorial
tension is characterized by:

1. Speed -- Â How quickly can the stimulus and assertion conditions
   detect and reveal latent defects or discover new ones arising from
   feature/patch application -per release metric as
   demonstratedÂ inÂ http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/30/50#subj2?Â High-speed
   regression test and evaluation is important here (~10K measurements/hour,
   for instance)

2. Frequency -- How often does the simulation run? For pre-check in? Before
   a candidate change is accepted into a project baseline, it needs to pass
   the simulation at top of branch merged w/candidate change). At
   post-integration? To qualify candidate release bits using all pre-check
   in passing candidate changes merged together into the candidate baseline?
   Who inspects and certifies the simulation results prior to publication?
   How many pairs of eyes are on this content? Are the change control board
   eyes trained/qualified to judge the simulation outcome?

3. Determinism -- Simulation results are identical for a constant stack and
   environment using constant stimulus/assertion conditions? Do the results
   match, assuming identical initial conditions? If there's a detected
   failure, does it arise from the environment? Ecosystem infrastructure or
   target stack? Stimulus/assertion conditions?  Whomsoever does the triage
   is usually one of the best pairs of eyes to participate in the decision
   to determine release viability. This is usually a software test engineer,
   a highly interdisciplinary life cycle participant possessing: a
   comprehensive knowledge of the stack/ecosystem under test, the test
   environment, and the test stimulus.

You've probably had submissions on this already; hardly end-of-the-world
stuff, though may be of interest.  I surf the web with Firefox on a Windows
7 laptop, and following advice on this very forum, I usually have JavaScript
disabled.  Allegedly this avoids possible security problems, but the big
advantage is that web pages load in a flash, *and* there's no problem with
loads of unwanted stuff wasting my monthly bandwidth allowance.  Some web
sites, particularly important ones like on-line bill payment or web e-mail
access, need JavaScript, so I manually enable this when required.

Last year, to my dismay a Firefox update removed the option to disable
JavaScript from the list, but I quickly found a 3rd-party add-on to put this
in the Tools menu (phew!).  Then last week Firefox updated to 57.0
("Quantum") which (according to the 'what's new' info) disables unauthorised
add-ons including this one, so I was stuck without JavaScript with no
choice...

Oh well, at least there's good old Internet Explorer 11 which I've hardly
ever used... but it runs without JavaScript as well?!?  I couldn't even find
any references to JavaScript in any of the set-up options either, and when I
tried the on-line help feature, this said "needs JavaScript to run"!
(Sounds like that old joke about 'the instructions for the microfilm reader
are on microfilm'.)  I don't recall ever changing this, but must have
disabled scripting when I first got the laptop to avoid any security issues.
Sigh...

To cut a long story short, A Google search (at least this doesn't need
JavaScript!) showed (a) IE actually uses the term 'Active scripting' for
this, with radio buttons for Disable/Prompt/Enable, so that fixed that, and
(b) Firefox set-up can be accessed via 'about:config' and the "I promise to
be good" screen.  What I plan to do is use IE for sites where JavaScript is
needed, and Firefox for everything else.

... the implicit assumption -- that if ISPs just delivered all the mail
things would be fine -- is quite false.

Most mail systems see about 90% spam.  An ISP like World that's been around
for a long time probably gets even more.  That means there are about ten
spam messages for every real one.  Even if your ISP spent the extra money
for the extra bandwidth and storage to receive and deliver all the spam,
your mail would be unusable, with the trickle of real mail hidden in the
torrent of junk.  I once met a person at the EFF who had a principled
unfiltered mailbox, and she said that every day she manually deleted 3000
messages from her inbox.  I don't know how she got any work done, and how
many of those 3000 were real.

You don't want mail systems to send non-delivery notices for all the mail
they don't deliver, since most of the return addresses are fake, and that
would just be more spam to the holders of the fake addresses.  Enough
systems do this that it has a name, blowback spam, and on my system I have
special rules to try and deal with the blowback spam I get to a few domains
that seem particularly popular with spammers.

The original problem, an SEC notification misfiled in a spam folder, was
clearly due to a bug in the spam filtering.  The SEC does not send out
notices at random, so the recipient must have given the SEC the address they
sent it to.  If the spam filters for that mailbox weren't set to deliver
mail from the SEC, which is not hard to recognize, that's just a bug.

What's much harder are bulk legal notices, such as ones notifying members of
a proposed class action.  Those are bulk mail sent to people who didn't ask
for it, typically from a sending system that's never sent them mail before,
which makes it technically identical to spam.  (Some people would say it is
spam.)  You can't just whitelist anything that looks like a legal notice
since spammers, not being totally stupid, would make their spam look like
legal notices.  Bulk mail services try to tell public blacklists when they
plan to do a run, and the blacklists tend to be cooperative, but even so,
when automated systems see a blast of unfamiliar mail, they tend to treat it
unfavorably.

The actual unsurprising moral here is that spammers ruin things for
everyone.

I never made such an assumption. I stated a fact: email is not a reliable
