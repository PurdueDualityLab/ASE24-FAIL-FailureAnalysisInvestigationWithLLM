Subject: Tablet computer zoom error saw plane fly 13 hours with 46-cm hole

A Qatar Airways Boeing 777 traveling from Miami to Doha struck airport
lights during takeoff and suffered a 46-cm tear in the fuselage, thanks in
part to a pilot zooming in too far on a tablet computer.

Flight QR778 left Miami on September 15th but as it took off, hit airport
landing lights. On arrival the plane was found to have suffered "a 46 cm
tear in the fuselage behind the rear cargo door which breached the pressure
vessel... numerous dents and scratches in the external airframe with 18
square meters of damaged skin." Inspection also found "90 external
individual areas of damage requiring assessment and rectification [and] some
damage to a metal guard on the left landing gear."

A Qatar Civil Aviation Authority (QCAA) report on the incident suggests the
crew were not familiar with the airport, so when the First Officer decided
to take off from a point 411m down the runway the choice was queried but
"The commander made a hand gesture and said something which he thought was
seeking reassurance from the crew that everything was OK."

Subject: Boston Red Line train leaves station without operator
  (Mark Arsenault and Eric Moskowitz via PGN)

An MBTA train from Braintree ran through the next four stops after the
driver got out to attend to a signal problem.  It was stopped just after the
North Quincy station, when power to the third rail was cut off.   [PGN]
https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/12/10/red-line-train-leaves-station-without-operator/L5NzTcDEX8dMQCQLvC7UBN/story.html

The story is actually much more complicated.  Controllers had to manually
get trains that were ahead of the runaway to express out of the
Braintree section onto the Red Line section, so that power could be shut off
on the entire Braintree section.  This is a fascinating hands-on dynamic
systemic solution to an apparently unplanned event.  My guess is that it
might even suggest some systemic changes!  [PGN]

  European policymakers are considering a draft of the European Data

  participating in social media without parental consent. Up until this
  point, the draft Regulation set the age at 13, which is consistent with

8 Dec 2015: Maine General https://www.mainegeneral.org/Pages/Home.aspx  went
  public about this breach.
13 Nov 2015: the health care provider was notified by the FBI of evidence of
  a breach.
They investigated & confirmed it, but do not have full details yet.

For some patients, info taken includes real identity, address, phone, date
of birth, emergency contact phone.  They do not yet know how many, out of
their approx 180,000 patients, but the info dates back to at least June
2009.

Also some employees were breached, with similar info.

So far, no evidence that credit financial info, social security #, or
driver's license #s taken, Maine General is offering impacted persons access
to one year of free credit monitoring and identity restoration services.

Subject: Medical privacy: small scale violations (via Dave Farber)

... Under the federal law known as HIPAA, it's illegal for health care
providers to share patients' treatment information without their permission.
The Office for Civil Rights, the arm of the Department of Health and Human
Services responsible for enforcing the law, receives more than 30,000
reports about privacy violations each year.

The bulk of the government's enforcement -- and the public's attention --
has focused on a small number of splashy cases in which hackers or thieves
have accessed the health data of large groups of people. But the damage done
in these mass breaches has been mostly hypothetical, with much information
exposed, but little exploited.

Subject: Cloud Lock inspects security by industry (Help Net)

Cloud Lock https://www.cloudlock.com/ analyzed 10 million users, 1 billion
files, 91,000 applications to survey risk across multiple industries.

You have to register with them, to download their report.
http://go.cloudlock.com/ebook-q3-2015-cybersecurity-report.html

They found on average, 5% of companies bother with password, and other
credentials, protection.

K-12 is worst, at 1%.

Retail "best" at 8%.

For break down on others, see help net link.

http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id214

99% of files in the financial services industry, which can be found by
anyone who can find a link, or locate them via search engines, can be
attributed to exposure by 1% of their users.  The overall average of
industries, in the article, is 74%.  Health Care is most secure in that
dept.

Manufacturing shows the least concern for protecting PII, like social
security #s. IDs, dates of birth, etc.

Al Mac comments: Someone had to be in last place.

I would have liked Critical Infrastructure to be a category, since I am now
reading "Lights Out" by Ted Koppel.

We have known for decades that security for our electric grid -- cyber
security and physical security, are both pretty dismal.

Mainstream news media is now giving more attention to this topic thanks to
Ted Koppel's reputation as a first class messenger.

The electric grid can be taken down for all of USA, and take years for
repair.  An enormous volume of our civilization is dependent upon it --
water, transportation, communication, restocking groceries, hospitals.
Millions will die.  It is not *if* ISIS can do it, but when they will do it.

Leaving Javascript turned on in your browser is the equivalent of leaving

need to bring his/her own when attacking your house.  It's actually even
worse than that; you've left a remote-controlled *robot* outside your home

sitting in the comfort of his/her home.

Joseph Cox, *WiReD*, 9 Dec2015
Hacker Lexicon: Malvertising, the Hack That Infects Computers Without a Click

Malvertising is when hackers buy ad space on a legitimate website, and, as
the name suggests, upload malicious advertisements designed to hack site
visitor's computers.

The news page looked perfectly innocent.  Apart from the reams of celebrity
gossip stories and throw-away magazine layout, nothing about the the website
for UK news site *The Daily Mail* seemed particularly malicious.  But, if
you visited the site in October, you might have fallen victim to a
sophisticated hacking campaign without even realizing it.

In the background of *The Daily Mail*, third-party advertisements were
surreptitiously and automatically redirecting readers to powerful exploit
kits, designed to install malware on their computers.

This is the booming trade of malvertising: where cybercriminals rent out ads
on sketchy corners of the Internet and popular sites alike, in order to
infect the computers of as many people as possible.

http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/ATT-Fools-Entire-Media-With-Giant-Gigabit-Fiber-Bluff-135848

  In reality, AT&T has consistently been cutting back its fixed-line
  investment budget and CAPEX to focus on more profitable wireless (read:
  usage capped) broadband. There's no budget for the kind of "real" fiber
  build AT&T's press release implies. In fact, while AT&T pats itself on the
  back for this latest build, it has been consistently trying to figure out
  how it can gut regulations in order to hang up on millions of DSL users it
  doesn't want to upgrade.  And while AT&T this week promised its over-hyped
  fiber build will someday reach 14 million residential and commercial
  locations, they didn't give a timeline for this accomplishment. That means
  AT&T technically could be winding up this not-particularly ambitious
  attempt to cherry pick the nation's high-end development communities and
  university student condos -- by 2030 or so.  We're potentially talking
  about only a few hundred thousand lines per year, many at universities.

Exactly. U-verse is fiber to the terminal, with the final leg almost
always provided over copper and using DSL-technologies. What AT&T is
doing is claiming a massive "fiber build-out" when in practice all
they're mostly doing is providing a relatively few direct fiber
connections to those terminals in special cases. But are they really
planning to spend a pile of money deploying fiber (on poles and buried)
to replace all that copper that serves most homes and businesses in
their service areas? If you think so, there's a bridge across the East
River in New York you might be interested in buying.

A look at recent patch lists for IE and Edge hints that many of IE's

We're all anxiously awaiting the day that Windows 10's new Edge browser
becomes usable. That hasn't happened yet, but it will some day next year.

But looking at yesterday's Patch Tuesday announcement and the one for
November has me wondering how much of this improved security is new bananas
-- and how much is built on a rotten old foundation.

The reason for my skepticism: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVEs). Each CVE entry is supposed to identify a unique security hole. The
overlap between Internet Explorer CVEs and Edge CVEs shows that many
security problems in IE have been inherited by Edge.

Subject: Re: Voter Privacy in the Age of Big Data

I stopped voting in 2006 and assumed, because of repeated warnings printed
on sample ballots, that my name would be purged from the voting rolls if I
failed to vote in three consecutive elections.

Three consecutive elections went by and I was still getting election junk
mail, so I phoned the office of the Registrar of Voters, explained that I
hadn't voted in the past three elections, did not intend to vote in future
elections, and requested that my name be removed from the voting rolls. They
assured me they'd take care of it.

Two more elections pass, and despite a few more phone calls, I was still
getting election junk mail. So I took the long bus trip out to the
Registrar's office and they had me fill out a form requesting that my name
be removed from the rolls. Problem solved? Not at all. It took me three more
years of repeated requests before they finally removed my name from the
rolls and the junk mail stopped coming.

I had several reasons for wanting my name off the rolls, including the
reduction of junk mail, a vague suspicion that when elections officials were
caught manufacturing "phantom votes," it would have been relatively easy for
them to have used the names of people who were registered but hadn't voted,
and that I thought it inappropriate for me, as a non-voter and an election
boycott advocate, to remain a registered voter.

Learning about the political dossiers kept on every US voter feels like a
sort of vindication to me -- that for privacy issues alone my struggle to
get unregistered was well worth the time and effort it cost.

Subject: Re: Your child is a CYBER-CRIMINAL! (RISKS-29.15)

When my daughter was about 8, she used to play a lot in a MRPG which enabled
players to earn "game money" by meeting challenges, and using it to buy
stuff for their avatar.  Game money could also be received at the game's
bank by redeeming coupons which were handed out in some stores when buying
certain children's products - clothes, toys etc. -- for real money.

My daughter usually spent all her earnings on shopping sprees, so she never
had more than 1000 game coins.  One day I noticed she suddenly had 32,000
coins; when asked how she got them, she said "from the Bank!".  It seems
that she just got into Google and typed "where can I get coupon codes for
<Game name>"; it brought her into a site of young hackers -- actually, they
did not do much hacking, some kids just filmed themselves playing the game
(they did not even know about screen capture) and posted the clips on
YouTube; my daughter simply stopped the video and copied the codes!
Amazingly, the games accepted these.

I'm still waiting for a knock on my door by FBI agents who'd come to
