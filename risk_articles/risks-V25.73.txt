Subject: Massive Visa overcharge

According to CNN, about 13,000 customers of Visa found a charge for
$23,148,855,308,184,500 on their statements
(http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/07/15/quadrillion.dollar.glitch/index.html).
Since that's rather larger than the combined GDPs of all the world's
economies, Visa did acknowledge the problem and reversed the charge,
and even reversed the $15 overdraft fee...

Where did that amount come from?  If you multiply by 100 to get cents and
convert to hex, you get 2020202020201250.  0x20 is an ASCII blank, which
suggests that someone copied a character string, rather than converting to a
long int or unsigned long int.  And the 0x1250?  Perhaps that's the
converted amount of $46.88.  (We can also learn that Visa is using 64-bit
integers, which means they're ready to handle charges greater than ~$21M or
perhaps $43M, and that they're using a non-EBCDIC platform at some point...)

"Test runs with Germany's first-generation electronic health cards and
doctors' "health professional cards" have suffered a serious setback.  After
the failure of a hardware security module (HSM) holding the private keys for
the root Certificate Authority (root CA) for the first-generation cards, it
emerged that the data had not been backed up. Consequently, if additional
new cards are required for field testing, all of the cards previously
produced for the tests will have to be replaced, because a new root CA will
have to be generated."

Company Caught in Texas Data Center Raid Loses Suit Against FBI

The first four paragraphs are a good synopsis.  In particular, note
paragraph three.

'A company whose servers were seized in a recent FBI raid on Texas data
centers applied for a temporary restraining order to force the bureau to
return its servers, but was denied by a U.S. district court last week.

The company, Liquid Motors, provides inventory management and marketing
services to national automobile dealers, such as AutoNation. It was one of
about 50 companies put out of business last week when the FBI seized the
servers at Core IP Networks, one of two
<http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2009/04/data-centers-ra.html> data centers
and co-location facilities raided by the FBI’s Dallas office in the last
month in an investigation into VoIP fraud.

Although Liquid Motors was not a target of the investigation, the FBI took
all of the company's servers and backup tapes in the raid.

"As a result, Liquid Motors, Inc. has been put out of business and is in
breach of its contracts with automobile dealers throughout the country," the
<http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/files/Liquid_Motors_v_Lynd.pdf>

automobile dealerships may hold Liquid Motors responsible for all of their

permanent and irreparable harm -- for which there is no adequate remedy at
law."'

Subject: Facebook fraud about to get more interesting?

A friend's facebook account was hacked recently (a neat little short-term
scam of contacting friends by FB chat, claiming to have been robbed in a
foreign country and needing money wired) and it got me to thinking about
possible interactions between Facebook's security and plans to open
user-generated content to public search and aggregration.

Scams that involve impersonating someone in a medium such as e-mail or chat
are necessarily fairly low-volume. Impersonations seen only/mostly by a
computer scale much better. So when people talk about the possibility of
selling data-mined analyses for content from facebook for marketing or other
purposes, fraudulent ways to manipulate the underlying data may become
attractive. If someone could use Facebook security holes to fake posts,
comments, fanhood, cause-joining and so forth, their clients could profit
when the misinformation shows up in the data-mining stream (and the
data-mining stream could become significantly less valuable).

As with spamming services, fraudsters wouldn't actually have to generate
profits for their customers, just the perception that hijacking facebook
identities wholesale would be a good idea...

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Federal-Web-sites-knocked-out-apf-2773092122.html?x=0&.v=3

A widespread and unusually resilient computer attack that began on 4 Jul
2009 knocked out the Web sites of several government agencies, including
some that are responsible for fighting cyber crime.  The Treasury
Department, Secret Service, Federal Trade Commission and Transportation
Department Web sites were all down at varying points over the holiday
weekend and into this week, according to officials inside and outside the
government. Some of the sites were still experiencing problems Tuesday
evening. Cyber attacks on South Korea government and private sites also may
be linked.  U.S. officials refused to publicly discuss details of the cyber
attack.  But Amy Kudwa, spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department,
said the agency's U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team issued a notice to
federal departments and other partner organizations about the problems and
"advised them of steps to take to help mitigate against such attacks."

texting during business meetings: many younger workers accept it; some older

that make it O.K., ethically speaking? ...

Subject: Re: More on the DC Metro collision 22 June 2009 (Thompson, R-25.71)

David Lesher notes, when speaking of the train not showing up, that "the
above is exactly what 100+ years of railroad signaling supposedly makes
impossible."  True -- but there's another layer here that might play
either way: the computerized control system.

Yes, the circuitry is supposed to be designed so that failures always
result in a "train present signal.  Why there was a failure that could
do the opposite is an important question.  But what about the
computer?  Did it misprocess some analog signal?  There's clearly a
logic failure, since it let a train disappear.  If there's a train in a
given spot at time T, at time T+delta, there is only a short stretch of
track where it can be.  Surely a computerized system should be able to
take that into account, and mark all of the blocks occupied until it
reacquires the train's location.  A simple system -- one that just
emulated the old relay-based logic -- might not have that ability,
since it would be stateless, but the DC Metro system's train-tracker is
almost certainly stateful, since it's operating location displays and
time of arrival displays at every station.  What happens to the state
object when a train vanishes?  Is it silently deleted?  Does the train
simply become invisible?  Is there a memory leak?  The first two, in my
opinion, are a definite safety bug.

Subject: Re: More on the CD Metro collision (Stangenberger, RISKS-25.72)

Taking as given that some (supposed to be all?) track sections have train
detectors that can identify specific trains, it's easy to think of at least
two ways to keep track of which trains are where within the system:

1) Poll each track section periodically to see which trains it currently
   sees, or
2) For each train, maintain a list of the last track section (or last few
   sections) where it was seen.

Option 1 runs into difficulty as soon as you have a faulty detector anywhere.
Option 2 may report a train being on an adjacent section if you have a
faulty detector, but it will never show *no train*.

It appears that the train control system in this case used some variation
of Option 1.

The RISK?  Failing to plan for graceful degradation in the event of sensor
failure.  Reporting the stalled train in a slightly incorrect position along
that track would have certainly been preferable to having it simply
"disappear" from view entirely, and might have saved some lives.

Subject: Re: More on the DC Metro collision 22 June 2009

The National Transportation Safety Board today issued an urgent safety
recommendation to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA)
calling for enhanced safety redundancy of its train control system.  "The
accident has shown that the train control system is susceptible to a single
point failure because it did not fail safe and stop the following train when
train detection was lost."  It called upon WMATA to install software such
that the higher level Supervision system would in effect, observe and track
train positions, and if/when a train "vanishes" from the basic ATP's view;
raise an alarm.  It also issued a broader recommendation to the FRA:

"Advise all rail transit operators that have train control systems capable
of monitoring train movements to determine whether their systems have
adequate safety redundancy if losses in train detection occur. If a system
is susceptible to single point failures, urge and verify that corrective
action is taken to add redundancy by evaluating track occupancy data on a
real-time basis to automatically generate alerts and speed restrictions to
prevent train collisions.  (R-09-7) (Urgent)"
  <http://ntsb.gov/Pressrel/2009/090713.html>

Some early comments/observations/speculations:

The basic reason NTSB's said what they did appears to be that they simply do
not [yet...] know why/how the track circuit failed, or how to predict when
other failures may happen. The failure was replicable for several days but
now is not.

0) WTH ?!%^&*%^??? "Failsafe" track block signals go back to 1872. AC track
circuits are newer but still were around to see the Cubbies win the World
Series....

1) No such product as NTSB wants exists at present; WMATA can't just slap
cash on a vendor's palm and walk away with a fragulator to install. They are
already dealing with the vendor of their current ATS platform to create
same.

2) The ATP runs on railroad standard components [vital relays, etc...]. The
ATS system now runs on Windows.

3) But the ATP unquestionably failed in a way that Just Can't Happen. So is
a secondary system that also relies on Windows a step back or going ahead?

4) The 'bright line' border between ATP and systems above is already fuzzy
in places; the higher-level stuff relies on ATP, for example.

5) Seldom does a major safety disaster have a single cause; this is no
exception. Train 214 was stopped short of the Ft. Totten platform because
there had been a breakdown 10-15 miles ahead, at Friendship Heights
station. They were using another train to push the dead one out of the
station.

6) Thus far there is no smoking gun. [Someone whose sole job it was to
constantly watch that track circuit but was instead texting etc; a safety
switch jumpered across, etc....]. Yes, the ops center might have noticed the
disappearing train 214, but it's a busy place, especially with #5 going on.

7) An obvious issue will be building a system that does NOT cry wolf
multiple times a day. Metrorail moves a lot of people every rush-hour, and
repeated line shutdowns will not be well-received.

8) There's a RISKS textbook sure to be written re: the whole saga.

Subject: Paypal accounts

I recently came to buy a pair of clip-on LED lamps.  The merchant supported
only VISA card payment via Paypal.  In 2004, much against my will, I opened
a Paypal account.  I knew then with the exquisite clarity of foretelling how
much pain it would bring into my life.

At the time, I lived in the UK, with a UK bank account and a UK address for
my VISA card.

I now live in the Netherlands and while retaining my UK bank account to
retain a VISA card (VISA doesn't really exist in the Netherlands) I now have
a Dutch address for the card.

Paypal *insists* on retaining your card address in an account (rather than
letting you enter it when paying) and so I needed to update my card address
so I can pay.  I manage to remember both my old e-mail address and password
and log into Paypal.

*Turns out you cannot change the country of your account.*

Paypal is a credit card billing processor who require the card address to be
stored in an account but do not permit the country to change.  I may be
wrong, but this seems an amazing design flaw.

So I couldn't pay and canceled the order.  A risk here is the silent loss
of business due to apparently broken intermediation systems.

However, I was then curious why this was so.  I contacted Paypal.

The exchange of e-mails that ensued is a wonderful thing, proving - as if
proof were needed - that with the correct use of incentives, rational,
sentient creatures wonderfully evolved over millions of years can be reduced
to drooling imbecility.

The dialog so far has been thus;

Me: 'Why can I not change the country in my Paypal account?'
PP: 'Be aware you cannot change the country in your account.  You must
    set up an account for each country you live in.'

Me: 'Isn't that an awkward way to change the country?'
PP: 'It's a security measure.  If people can have multiple accounts per
     country, they could use it for fraud.'

Me: 'But they can create multiple accounts anyway, just by making them.
    [Anyway, how does having multiple accounts permit fraud?']
PP: 'All computers have an IP address.  Paypal only permits users to
    log in from the computer they created the account from.  It's a security
    measure.'

Me: 'You reply is totally factually incorrect and completely irrelevant
    in every way to my previous question.'
PP: 'Having carefully reviewed your concern, and I see you would like
    to know if you use your Paypal account on multiple computers.  You can.'

Me: 'That was not my question.  I want to know why I can't change the
    country in my account.'
PP: 'Be aware you cannot change the country in your account.  You must
    set up an account for each country you live in.'

Suddenly, the inability to change country all made sense.

Subject: SPAM: Phishing - the state of the art?

I received two e-mail messages purporting to be from Abbey National, a UK
bank that is a subsidiary of Banco Santander.

Both were flagged as spam. As I have some sort of relationship with this
company (unlike, say, Wells Fargo, a popular phishing target), I
investigated further. Here's what Abbey's web site says:

"Important warning about Internet banking fraud

Customers of several UK banks have recently been the target of a fraud which
uses fake e-mails to encourage customers to enter their card or security
details into a counterfeit copy of their website. Abbey will never send you
an e-mail asking you to enter, reconfirm or change your security
details. ..."

That sounds good. Let's see if it's true ...

Message #1, "*** IMPORTANT *** Ensure The Safety Of Your Online Banking
Account", was a clear phisher, a multipart message with a text/plain
repeating the subject and text/html containing a 'security notice' with a
supposed login link to Abbey, actually to 185.143.broadband7.iol.cz.

"Dear Abbey National online account holder,

This is an important message from the Abbey National Security Centre and
has been issued due to a recent upgrade of our secure servers. All current

Apart from the fragmentary paragraph preceding the phish-hook, this is
really quite good, reasonably grammatical and plausible enough unless you
happen to see the actual link behind the 'Log On' hyperlink. It certainly
wouldn't be the first time a company had used some external service to send
its e-mail, so the fraudulent From: address nxqbpf@messagelabs.com is nicely
constructed, the choice of MessageLabs adding a further glint of security.

able to use the online service until we contact you and complete additional
security checks. This can be avoided simply by following our online service
link above. ..."

Is this is a real attempt by the bank to find my phone number?

If it is, see effectively how they have simulated a phishing e-mail by

* not including the customer's name in the text;

* using slightly unnatural English phrases like "your urgent phone
  number", "anytime" and "otherwise" as a conjunction;

* actually including a banking login link in HTML mail, for heaven's sake;

* using three pointlessly different top-level domains (abbey.com,
  abbeynational.co.uk, abbey.co.uk) in one communication.

On the other hand the security system that's proposed sounds all too
plausibly like something that a retail bank might propose: apparently when I
try to maintain my Abbey account from abroad, Abbey will phone my number,
not be able to contact me (since I am away), and consequently prevent me
from maintaining my account. So I might as well have stayed with telephone
banking, then.

Most weirdly the login link is to
https://myonlineaccounts2.abbeynational.co.uk/CentralLogonWeb/Logon?action=prepare
which is just the same as I get at www.abbey.com (which in turn is linked
from www.santander.com).

But the SMTP headers look extremely phishy: instead of an Abbey server the
initial sender is

Received: from User ([24.72.38.106])        by SHOPWEB.PCSECURITYSHIELD.COM

And http://www.ip-db.com/24.72.38.106 indicates that User is a cable modem
in Regina, Saskatchewan, which is a pretty unlikely outsourcer for Abbey.

So is this really a new turn in the phishing war -- a psych-ops attempt to
disprove the bank's credibility and possibly increase the hit-rate of
future phishery like message #1?

Or did the phisherman just incorrectly bait the hook by forgetting to
change the domain part of the link?

At least the ObRisk of e-mail messages with embedded links can only be
restated. Always navigate to secure sites manually using a trusted domain
name that you found outside the e-mail.

Subject: Re: Bozeman (RISKS-25.71)

Andrew Koenig asked what would happen if a prospective employer were to
require all applicants to sign a contract that assigns the applicant's
fourth-amendment rights to the employer as a condition of consideration for
employment, specifically whether said employer could require said applicant
to agree to give the company power of attorney to authorize police searches
of your home and possessions in exchange for the company looking at your job
application.

The Fourth Amendment applies only to governments. Absent a specific law to
the contrary, a private employer could demand the right to search an
applicant's (or employee's) home and possessions. The applicant's recourse
is to refuse the job, the employee's is to quit.

(By the way, the police will not search a premises solely at the request of
a private employer, no matter what powers of attorney have been signed.
Without a warrant, police can't conduct searches, with a few specified
exceptions.)

Since the City of Bozeman is a government, the Fourth Amendment does apply
and it could be enjoined from enforcing such a contract provision.  With
media reports indicating that it has backed off the original provision
regarding online accounts, it appears that the policy will not be tested in
court, making its constitutionality moot.

The difference is that in the Bozeman case, they would *additionally*
be giving the employer power of attorney to *impersonate* them.

Subject: Oakland 2010, IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, CFP

I am happy to let you know that the Call for Papers for the 31st IEEE
Symposium on Security and Privacy ("Oakland 2010") is now available.
	
      31st IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy - Call For Papers

Important Dates (all deadlines are 23:59 PST)

    Workshop proposals due: Friday, 21 August 2009
    Research papers due: Wednesday, 18 November 2009
    Systematization of Knowledge papers due: Tuesday, 24 November
    Acceptance notification: 1 February 2010
    Final papers due: 1 March 2010

Since 1980, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the
premier forum for computer security research, presenting the latest
developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners.

We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research
contributions in any aspect of computer security or privacy. Papers may
present advances in the theory, design, implementation, analysis,
verification, or empirical evaluation of secure systems.  S&P is
interested in all aspects of computer security and privacy.  Papers
without a clear application to security or privacy, however, will be
considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.

*Systematization of Knowledge Papers*.  In addition to the standard
research papers, we are also soliciting papers focused on
systematization of knowledge. The goal of this call is to encourage work
that evaluates, systematizes, and contextualizes existing knowledge.
These papers will provide a high value to our community but would
otherwise not be accepted because they lack novel research
contributions. Suitable papers include survey papers that provide useful
perspectives on major research areas, papers that support or challenge
long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, or papers that provide an
extensive and realistic evaluation of competing approaches to solving
specific problems. Submissions will be distinguished by a checkbox on
the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to
the same standards as traditional research papers, except instead of
emphasizing novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value
to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and
included in the proceedings.

*Workshops*.  The Symposium is also soliciting submissions for co-located
workshops.  Workshop proposals should be sent by Friday, 21 August 2009
by e-mail to Carrie Gates (carrie.gates@ca.com).  Workshops may be
half-day or full-day in length.  Submissions should include the workshop
title, a short description of the topic of the workshop, and biographies
of the organizers.

for more information including detailed submission instructions.
