https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64051121

Cloud has many advantages, but if the cloud provider disappears, then so
does your infrastructure. This article looks at a couple of businesses that
have been hit by outages and disappearance of provider.

``Using cloud services, by definition, makes a business reliant on a third
party,'' says Vili Lehdonvirta of the Oxford Internet Institute and author
of Cloud Empires.  ``What is the cloud? Well, the cloud is somebody else's
computer.''

  It is complex, setting up highly available systems is even more complex
  (I'm sure, not news to anyone here...). Cloud is not a panacea, especially
  for small businesses. At least we are starting to get mainstream articles
  that acknowledge this, rather than pushing cloud as the solution for all
  ills.

 because no one can turn them off (Corky Siemaszko)

(NBC News)

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/lights-massachusetts-school-year-no-one-can-turn-rcna65611

Wilbraham Massachusetts: For nearly a year and a half, the roughly 7,000
lights in a sprawling Massachusetts high school have been on continuously,
because the district can√¢t turn them off. While district leaders blame the
pandemic and supply chain issues for being unable to fix the failed lighting
system, taxpayers have been stuck paying for the costly energy bills.

The lights have been on at a Massachusetts school for over a year because no
one can turn them off the roughly 7,000 lights in the sprawling building.

The lighting system was installed at Minnechaug Regional High School when
it was built over a decade ago and was intended to save money and energy.
But ever since the software that runs it failed on Aug. 24, 2021, the
lights in the Springfield suburbs school have been on continuously, costing
taxpayers a small fortune....

The system was designed to save energy -- and thus save money by
automatically adjusting the lights as needed.

Subject: Wi-Fi Routers Can Detect Human Locations, Poses Within a Room
 (Mark Tyson)

Mark Tyson, Tom's Hardware, 18 Jan 2023

Carnegie Mellon University scientists have been testing a system that uses
Wi-Fi signals to detect the positions and poses of people in a room. The
researchers positioned TP-Link Archer A7 AC1750 Wi-Fi routers at either end
of the room, while algorithms generated wireframe models of people in the
room by analyzing the signal interference the people caused. The researchers
based the perception system on Wi-Fi signal channel-state-information, or
the ratio between transmitted and received signal waves. A computer
vision-capable neural network architecture processes this data to execute
dense pose estimation; the researchers deconstructed the human form into 24
segments to accelerate wireframe representation. They claim the wireframes'
position and pose estimates are as good as those generated by certain
"image-based approaches."

via ACM TechNews, 23 Jan 2023

Zitai Chen and David Oswald at the U.K.'s University of Birmingham uncovered
a bug in the control systems of server motherboards that could be exploited
to compromise sensitive information or to destroy their central processing
units (CPUs). The researchers found a feature in the Supermicro X11SSL-CF
motherboard often used in servers that they could tap to upload their own
control software. Chen and Oswald discovered a flash memory chip in the
motherboard's baseboard management controller that they could remotely
command to send excessive electrical current through the CPU, destroying it
in seconds. After the researchers disclosed the flaw to Supermicro, the
company said it has rated its severity as "high" and has patched the bug in
its existing motherboards.

University of Essex (UK), 19 Jan 2023, via ACM TechNews, 23 Jan 2023

A brainwave-monitoring technique created by researchers at the U.K.'s
University of Essex can identify to which specific piece of music people are
listening. The researchers combined functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) with electroencephalogram monitoring to measure a person's brain
activity while listening to music. They used a deep learning neural network
model to translate this data in order to reconstruct and accurately identify
the piece of music with 71.8% accuracy. Essex's Ian Daly said, "We have
shown we can decode music, which suggests that we may, one day, be able to
decode language from the brain."

Subject: Mathematical Trick Lets Hackers Shame People into Fixing
 Software Bugs (Matthew Sparkes)

Matthew Sparkes, *New Scientist*, 17 2023 vai ACM TechNews

Researchers at the Galois software company have developed a zero-knowledge
proof (ZKP) method of using math to verify vulnerabilities in a particular
software program, without releasing details of how an exploit works. The
idea is to generate public pressure to force a company to release a fix
while preventing hackers from exploiting the flaw. Said Galois' Santiago
Cu=C8llar, "There are a lot of frustrated people trying to disclose
vulnerabilities, or saying 'I found this vulnerability, I'm talking to this
company and they're doing nothing'." However, bug-bounty hunter Rotem Bar is
concerned that ZKPs could generate a "ransom effect" that gives power to the
attacker.

Jennifer Chu, *MIT News*, 18 Jan 2023 via ACM TechNews

Physicists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the
California Institute of Technology have identified a randomness in the
quantum fluctuations of atoms that follows a predictable pattern and
developed a benchmarking protocol to assess the fidelity of existing quantum
analog simulators based on their quantum fluctuation patterns. The
researchers tested this on a quantum analog simulator containing 25 atoms by
exciting the atoms with a laser, letting the qubits interact and evolve
naturally, and collecting 10,000 measurements on the state of each qubit
during multiple runs. They developed a model to predict the random
fluctuations and compared the predicted outcomes with experimental
measurements, which yielded a close match. MIT's Soonwon Choi said, "With
our tool, people can know whether they are working with a trustable system."

Lily Hay Newman, *Ars Technica*, 11 Jan 2023, via ACM TechNews

Siemens has disclosed that a vulnerability in its SIMATIC S7-1500 series of
programmable logic controllers could allow attackers to install malicious
firmware and assume full control of the devices. Red Balloon Security
researchers discovered the vulnerability, which is the result of a basic
error in the cryptography's implementation. However, because the scheme is
physically burned onto a dedicated ATECC CryptoAuthentication chip, a
software patch cannot fix the vulnerability. Siemens recommended customers
assess "the risk of physical access to the device in the target deployment"
and implement "measures to make sure that only trusted personnel have access
to the physical hardware."

Subject: DNS Attack enabled by well-know passwords; An issue that should be
 long-resolved (Ars Technica and precursor note)

Well-known passwords have been a well-known security hazard since the early
1990s. As I wrote in "Networks Placed at Risk, By Their Service Providers"
(7 Dec 2009, it took many years for major ISPs to not use well-known
passwords on router/firewalls provided to subscribers).
http://www.rlgsc.com/blog/ruminations/networks-placed-at-risk.html)

Over a decade later, this issue should be long-since banished to history.
However, as reported by ArsTechnica, this appears to be depressingly not the
case.

ArsTechnica reports that:

  Researchers have uncovered a malicious Android app that can tamper with
  the wireless router the infected phone is connected to and force the
  router to send all network devices to malicious sites.

  The malicious app, found by Kaspersky, uses a technique known as DNS
  (Domain Name System) hijacking. Once the app is installed, it connects to
  the router and attempts to log in to its administrative account by using
  default or commonly used credentials, such as admin:admin. When
  successful, the app then changes the DNS server to a malicious one
  controlled by the attackers. From then on, devices on the network can be
  directed to imposter sites that mimic legitimate ones but spread malware
  or log user credentials or other sensitive information."

The ArsTechnica article does not indicate whether the compromised hot-spots
used vendor or customer purchased equipment. It does increase the importance
of setting management passwords on firewalls to safe values.

Similarly, other precautions, e.g., segregated guest WiFi, should be
followed.

Subject: How Smart Are the Robots Getting? (Cade Metz)

Cade Metz, *The New York Times*, 20 Jan 2023

The Turing test used to be the gold standard for proving machine
intelligence. This generation of bots is racing past it.

"These systems can do a lot of useful things," said Ilya Sutskever, chief
scientist at OpenAI and one of the most important A.I. researchers of the
past decade, referring to the new wave of chatbots. "On the other hand, they
are not there yet. People think they can do things they cannot."

As the latest technologies emerge from research labs, it is now obvious --
if it was not obvious before if it was not obvious before -- that scientists
must rethink and reshape how they track the progress of artificial
intelligence. The Turing test is not up to the task.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/technology/chatbots-turing-test.html

  PGN adds, from the ACM News Digest on the same item:

  New-generation online chatbots display a semblance of intelligence that
  appears to pass the Turing test, in which humans can no longer be certain
  whether they are conversing with a human or a machine. Bots like OpenAI's
  ChatGPT and GPT-4 systems appear intelligent without being sentient or
  conscious; consequently, OpenAI's Ilya Sutskever says, "People think they
  can do things they cannot." Modern neural networks have learned to produce
  text by analyzing vast volumes of digital text and extrapolating patterns
  in how people link words, letters, and symbols. However, the chatbots'
  language skills belie their lack of reason or common sense.

  [Also noted by Matthew Kruk.  PGN]

    [The Turing Test is no longer adequate as originally stated.  Joe
    Weizenbaum's Eliza could fool some people for a while.  GPT systems can
    fool anyone who doesn't understand the fundamental blind spots inherent
    in the information used to train the AI, and the consequential inherent
    incompleteness of the responses.  The grammatical and linguistic polish
    is misleading.  See RISKS-33.58-60.  PGN]

Subject: Robot Cars Are Causing 911 False Alarms in San Francisco (WiReD)

City agencies say the incidents and other disruptions show the need for more
transparency about the vehicles and a pause on expanding service.

Each time, police and firefighters rushed to the scene but found the same
thing: a passenger who had fallen asleep in their robot ride.  [...}

The San Francisco agencies cite a number of unsettling and previously
unreported incidents, including the false alarms over snoozing riders and
two incidents in which self-driving vehicles from Cruise appear to have
impeded firefighters from doing their jobs.

One incident occurred in June of last year, a few days after the state gave
Cruise permission to pick up paying passengers in the city. One of the
company's robot taxis ran over a fire hose in use at an active fire scene,
the agencies' letter says, an action that ``can seriously injure
firefighters.''

In the second incident, just last week, the city says firefighters attending
a major fire in the Western Addition neighborhood saw a driverless Cruise
vehicle approaching. They √¢made efforts to prevent the Cruise AV from
driving over their hoses and were not able to do so until they shattered a
front window of the Cruise AV,√¢ the San Francisco agencies wrote in their
letter.  [...]

Last summer, WIRED reported that two fleetwide outages had caused Cruise

I think we have an erosion of faith in science and institutions, and we've
already had an erosion of faith in religion institutions, so we are left
with -- what? Our own truths and conspiracies.

The problem in my mind is that to operate in an increasingly complex world,
you need faith. When things grow complex, you must put your trust in
something. Can anyone on this list prove the Big Bang theory? Can anyone
explain how mRNA vaccines work?

For most of us, the answer would be no, but we continue to have faith in the
people -- scientists and doctors -- that (say they) know the answers. For
most people, this is not functionally different than believing in priests,
ministers, rabbis, and imans. They are the gateway to your truths -- or a
specific set of truths -- so you have to trust them to be representing your
interests in a specific reality.

With technology and the complexity of the systems behind technology, we
require faith in the companies, organizations and government with access to
and control over those systems. In effect, we are creating a new layer of
reality with more complexities and controlled by different groups, and
implicitly declaring our faith in those groups to responsibly manage that
reality.  Yet, companies have shown very little to earn our faith and
governments are made of people, who by self interest, often do not make
choices that are best for society.

I wonder if AI, with the proper directives and incentives from society,
would better manage everything. AI controlled by a relative few is the true
threat, because it will create and perpetuate a massive imbalance of capital
and power. But AI working on behalf of everyone, equally -- I find that idea
intriguing. We would be creating our own digital gods and declaring our
faith in them.

  (This trip down the rabbit hole brought to you by the letter 'P,' for
  procrastination.)

    [To be clear, my point is not whether you understand them, but whether
    you can prove them, or do the logical/mathematical proofs necessary to
    not have to trust any other person in the chain of knowledge.
    Otherwise, you are putting your faith that someone else has proven it,
    and/or putting faith in the scientific method -- that people have
    checked, and proven, the work of others.  R]

Tiffany Hsu, *The New York Times*, 22 Jan 2023, via ACM TechNews; 25 Jan

Most countries do not have laws to prevent or respond to deepfake
technology, and doing so would be difficult regardless because creators
generally operate anonymously, adapt quickly, and share their creations
through borderless online platforms. However, new Chinese rules aim to curb
the spread of deepfakes by requiring manipulated images to have the
subject's consent and feature digital signatures or watermarks. The
implementation of such rules could prompt other governments to follow suit.
University of Pittsburgh's Ravit Dotan said, "We know that laws are coming,
but we don't know what they are yet, so there's a lot of unpredictability."

Subject: Artificial Intelligence and National Security (Reza Montasari book
 reviewed by Sven Dietrich)

Book Review By Sven Dietrich, 30 Jan 2023
The Cipher Newsletter, IEEE CIPHER, Issue 171, 30 Jan 2023

Springer Verlag, 2022
ISBN ISBN 978-3-031-06708-2, ISBN 978-3-031-06709-9 (eBook)
VIII, 230 pages

 "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that." We often associate
Artificial Intelligence (AI) with dystopian movie scenes, such as this
one, a quote by HAL 9000 from Stanley Kubrick's 1968 science-fiction
movie "2001: A Space Odyssey." The idea is that of a human-created AI
system going out of control and turning against the humans in some
ways. Recent discussions around OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT are
reminiscent of that, asking the question: "What if?" We have seen
these discussions initiated by both the public and policymakers,
resulting in, among others, NIST's AI risk management framework, AI
committees in government agencies, and a public dialogue on the
matter.

In tune with these concerns, Reza Montasari's fall 2022 release of the
Springer book "Artificial Intelligence and National Security" is a
series of curated papers on various topics related to the book
title. These papers are mostly focusing on the use of AI for national
security and a wide range of legal, ethical, moral and privacy
challenges that come with it. Some of the papers are co-authored by
Montasari, some are not.

A total of eleven articles, effectively chapters, are featured in this
book. The topics sometimes overlap a little, so here is an overview of
these papers.

The first one, *Artificial Intelligence and the Spread of Mis- and
Disinformation* talks about the post-truth era and the use of AI for
nefarious information campaigns, invoking thoughts of another dystopian
work, 1984. It discusses the clear difference between mis- and
disinformation, and the double-edge sword of AI here: creation and
mitigation are both possible for this topic, which is very timely.

The second one, *How States' Recourse to Artificial Intelligence for
National Security Purposes Threatens Our Most Fundamental Rights* explores
the pitfalls of the use of AI technology in the context of human rights
violations or constitutional rights violations, depending on your
jurisdiction. Here the reader will find discussions of the impact of
surveillance technologies on both sides of the fence, whatever your fence
may be.

The third one, *The Use of AI in Managing Big Data Analysis Demands: Status
and Future Directions* taps in the controversies of big data analysis. Data
is easy to accumulate, and the ramifications can be deep: while data can
originate from one location, its origin can be varied due to the vast nature
of the Internet or the presence of multinational companies across the globe.

The fourth one, *The Use of Artificial Intelligence in Content Moderation in
Countering Violent Extremism on Social Media Platforms* touches upon the
moderation of extreme views being proliferation in social media platforms,
which isn't always successful when applied with AI techniques.

The fifth one, *A Critical Analysis into the Beneficial and Malicious
Utilisations of Artificial Intelligence* performs a survey of benign and
malicious uses of AI. A rather optimistic view argues that benign uses may
outweigh the malicious ones.

The sixth one, *Countering Terrorism: Digital Policing of Open Source
Intelligence and Social Media Using Artificial Intelligence* is similar to
the fourth one, discussing moderation, analysis, and policing of social
media using AI.

The seventh one, *Cyber Threat Prediction and Modeling* considers threat
prediction and modelling at the business level, e.g., for C-Suite
executives, for those seeking risk management approaches using AI.

The eighth one, *A Critical Analysis of the Dark Web Challenges to Digital
Policing* investigates the dark and deep web and what policies may be needed
to limit illegal behavior there.

The ninth one, *Insights into the Next Generation of Policing: Understanding
the Impact of Technology on the Police Force in the Digital Age* muses about
the impact of AI on the police work and patrolling the digital beat.

The tenth one, *The Dark Web and Digital Policing* is similar to the eighth
one, and tries to find a middle ground between enforcing laws in the dark
web as well as protecting it.

The eleventh one, finally, *Pre-emptive Policing: Can Technology be the
Answer to Solving London's Knife Crime Epidemic?* talks about combining
various modern techniques, including AI, for combating real physical crime
(rather than cybercrime) in a real city, London in this case. It's not quite
a *Minority Report* theme, yet another dystopian reference by this reviewer,
but many enforcement agencies already use the assistance of smart
technologies for combating crime.

The book is really meant to be thought-provoking, to enable discussions to
what extent of the law or with what technological capability, AI or not,
this world should be moving forward. It is by no means complete, but each
paper (or chapter) provides good starting points with extensive references
for reading further into each domain that is brought forth in this book.

Overall this is a timely book, especially in light of the discussions
about the OpenAI chatbot ChatGPT (as well as Dall-E image
manipulation) and the role of AI technologies in modern society in
recent weeks. I hope you will enjoy reading it.

Subject: Cybersecurity Myths and Misperceptions: Avoiding the Hazards and
 Pitfalls that Derail Us

The book is authored by
me (Eugene H. Spafford), Leigh Metcalf, and Josiah Dykstra, with a Foreword
by Vint Cerf and whimsical illustrations by Pattie Spafford.

What the book is about: Cybersecurity is fraught with hidden and unsuspected
dangers and difficulties. Despite our best intentions, common and avoidable
mistakes arise from folk wisdom, faulty assumptions about the world, and our
own human biases. Cybersecurity implementations, investigations, and
research all suffer as a result. Many of the bad practices sound logical,
especially to people new to the field of cybersecurity, and that means they
get adopted and repeated despite not being correct. For instance, why isn't
the user the weakest link?

Read over 175 common misconceptions held by users, leaders, and
cybersecurity professionals, along with tips for how to avoid them.  Learn
the pros and cons of analogies, misconceptions about security tools, and
pitfalls of faulty assumptions.

We wrote the book to be accessible to a wide audience, from novice to
expert. There are lots of citations to supporting materials, but it is not
written as an academic treatise.

Many of the the ideas covered in RISKS over the years are touched on in one
way or another in the book.

The book is now shipping direct orders from Addison-Wesley:

It will be available in bookstores within the next few weeks.
