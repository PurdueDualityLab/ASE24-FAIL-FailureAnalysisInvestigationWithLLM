313.0,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/18/science/paleontology-banned-words-convey.html,2020-10-26 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,,"Published on 2020-10-18 00:00:00.  The trouble started when  Thomas R. Holtz Jr. , an expert on the Tyrannosaurus rex, typed “Hell Creek Formation,” the rock unit in Montana where the remains of North America’s last giant dinosaurs have been found. He was trying to answer a colleague’s question after an online presentation during the first day of the  Society of Vertebrate Paleontology ’s 80th annual conference last week. But Mr. Holtz was stunned when instead of the word “Hell,” four asterisks appeared in the chat. Puzzled, he described the issue on Twitter. Colleagues chimed in with other words that had been rejected by the software system set up to filter out profanities: knob, pubis, penetrate and stream, among others. “Most funny to us was the censorship of ‘bone,’ which, after all, are the main thing we work with,” Mr. Holtz said. Many have raised concerns about online censorship by large tech companies. Instagram  has been criticized  for banning posts of art featuring nudity. In 2016, the Swedish Cancer Society  used graphics of square-shaped breasts  in a video about breast exams to evade Facebook’s censors. But the blocking of benign terms commonly used by paleontologists seemed especially overzealous. After Mr. Holtz  posted a list of the banned words on Twitter,  he received a series of responses. Some users were outraged. “Pubis? Seriously? What are you going to call it???”  wrote L.P. Norman , a self-described amateur astronomer. “The forward of the ischium bone???” Others tried to be helpful. “Gettathesaurus,”  one person wrote . The paleontology conference, which attracts hundreds of scientists, amateur bone collectors and dinosaur enthusiasts every year, was supposed to take place in Cincinnati. But the pandemic forced the organizers to move it online, like thousands of other trade shows, summits and professional conferences that were scheduled to be held at hotels and convention centers. That meant scrambling to organize sessions for panelists who had expected to make presentations in public, and developing codes of conduct for participants to prevent any embarrassing conduct online. The society contracted with a software company that provides chat sessions with built-in algorithms that could filter any profanities or offensive terms. “All software plug-ins are going to have filters to make sure you don’t get out of control,” said Carolyn Bradfield, chief executive of  Convey Services,  the company hired by the society. “In that particular case, the filter was too tight,” she said. Ms. Bradfield, who listened in on 10 sessions, said she learned of the problem from participants who were talking about it. She said she was as surprised as everyone else. “I don’t know why in the world the word ‘bone’ was in there,” Ms. Bradfield said. Jessica Theodor , president of the society, said participants kept finding other words that triggered the asterisks and alerted the society’s leaders, who then relayed the information to Convey Services. The company quickly removed the words as it learned about them. Paleontologists began having fun with the system. They typed in random words to see which ones would result in asterisks. One  created a meme that compared their efforts with those of the velociraptors in the film “Jurassic Park ” that threw themselves against an electric fence to find weak spots. “A couple of us chuckled and started calling Hell Creek ‘Heck Creek,’” said  Stephanie K. Drumheller , a lecturer and paleontologist at the University of Tennessee. Jack Tseng , a professor of paleontology at the University of California, Berkeley, said some censored words were not as amusing. For instance, Wang, a popular surname in China, was also replaced with asterisks. “I knew how Wang was used in the vernacular,” Professor Tseng said. “I did go to high school.” He was curious if Johnson, another surname that can be used as a term for male genitalia, would make it through. To his dismay, the system allowed it. “That was bothersome,” Professor Tseng said. “If you’re going to censor, censor everything. Censor Johnson so everyone is offended.” Ms. Bradfield said she did not know why Wang was caught by the algorithm but not Johnson. Convey Services used a third party — Arena.im — to provide the technology that filtered out certain words. But Ms. Bradfield said it was ultimately her company’s responsibility to make sure it avoided a similar problem in the future. The solution, she said, was straightforward. “We have to make sure we take that filter and remove words that are stupid and shouldn’t have been there,” she said. Still, Professor Theodor, who teaches at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, said she was relieved by how smoothly the five-day conference ultimately unfolded. “If this is the worst thing that happens when we move our paleontology conference online, that’s just fine,” she said. Professor Tseng, who has been attending the conferences since he was an undergraduate, said the episode has led him to question how he and his colleagues sound when laypeople hear them discussing knobs and bones out of context. “Maybe if you hear a bunch of paleontologists talk in the field it sounds very dirty,” he said. “And we just don’t realize it.”",,2023-04-20 16:44:40.382491+00:00,True,False,0.7539757743830555,Paleontologists See Stars as Software Bleeps Scientific Terms ... - The New York Times,Software filter censors benign terms at paleontology conference.,"The software failure incident occurred during the first day of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology's 80th annual conference, which was moved online due to the pandemic. The system that failed was a chat session software provided by Convey Services, contracted by the society to filter out profanities and offensive terms. The failure was caused by the software's algorithm being too strict and filtering out benign terms commonly used by paleontologists, such as ""Hell,"" ""bone,"" and even the surname ""Wang."" The impact of the failure was the censorship of legitimate words used in discussions and presentations, leading to confusion and frustration among participants. The responsible entity for the failure was Convey Services, the software company, specifically their third-party provider Arena.im. The impacted entity was the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology and all participants of the conference, including paleontologists, scientists, and dinosaur enthusiasts.",The chat session filter system

296.0,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/technology/fraud-payment-apps.html,2020-10-11 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,,"Published on 2020-10-11 00:00:00.  Charee Mobley, who teaches middle school in Fort Worth, Texas, had just $166 to get herself and her 17-year-old daughter through the last two weeks of August. But that money disappeared when Ms. Mobley, 37, ran into an issue with Square’s Cash App, an instant payments app that she was using in  the coronavirus pandemic  to pay her bills and do her banking. After seeing an errant online shopping charge on her Cash App, Ms. Mobley called what she thought was a help line for it. But the line had been set up by someone who asked her to download some software, which then took control of the app and drained her account. “I didn’t have gas money and I couldn’t pay my daughter’s senior dues,” Ms. Mobley said. “We basically just had to stick it out until I got paid the following week.” In the pandemic, people have flocked to instant payment apps like Cash App,  PayPal’s Venmo  and  Zelle  as they have wanted to avoid retail bank branches and online commerce has become more ingrained. To encourage that shift, the payment apps have added services like debit cards and routing numbers so that they work more like traditional banks. But many people are unaware of how vulnerable they can be to losses when they use these services in place of banks. Payment apps have long had fraud rates that are three to four times higher than traditional payment methods such as credit and debit cards, according to data from the security firms Sift and Chargeback Gurus. Image A Cash App marketing campaign known as “Cash App Fridays” provided fraudsters with a ready phone book of potential victims, according to security experts. Credit... Melissa Golden for The New York Times The fraud appears to have surged in recent months as more people use the apps. At Venmo, daily users have grown by 26 percent since last year, while the number of customer reviews mentioning the words fraud or scam has risen nearly four times as fast, according to a New York Times analysis of data from Apptopia, a firm that tracks mobile services. Driving the surge is the apps’ ease of use. People need just an email address to create a Cash App account and a phone number to make a Venmo account. That simplicity has made it seamless for thieves to set up accounts and to send requests for money to other users, something that was not possible with traditional bank payments. The apps’ instantaneous transactions — compared to the two or three days needed for a standard bank transfer — have also meant that Venmo and Cash App have less time to detect whether a transaction is fraudulent. “Fast payments equals fast fraud,” said Frank McKenna, the chief fraud strategist for the security firm PointPredictive. The apps, which are sometimes known as peer-to-peer payments services, “are super convenient for customers but that also makes them ripe targets,” he said. Square, PayPal and Zelle do not disclose the rate of fraud on their apps. PayPal takes steps to “limit potential fraudulent activity and mitigate any customer impact,” a spokeswoman said, but she did not address whether it had seen more cases of fraud. Zelle, which was founded by a coalition of banks, appears to have experienced less fraud because it has more robust authentication for new users and more legal protections in case of loss, security experts said. “Protecting consumers from abusive scams and fraud is a top priority for Zelle,” said Meghan Fintland, a spokeswoman for Early Warning, the company that runs the app.  Of all the payment apps, fraud issues have been particularly acute for Square’s Cash App. As the number of people using the app daily has grown 59 percent over the last year, the number of reviews about it that mention the words fraud or scam has risen 165 percent, according to Apptopia. Annual Growth in Payment Apps

The New York Times The Better Business Bureau also said it had received more than twice as many complaints about Cash App as Venmo over the past year. That is significant given that Venmo has twice as many users as Cash App, according to Apptopia. Lena Anderson, a spokeswoman for Square, said the company was “aware that there has been a recent rise in scammers trying to take advantage of customers using financial products, including Cash App. We’ve taken a number of proactive steps and made it our top priority.” Square, which is  led by Jack Dorsey , who is also chief executive of Twitter, introduced Cash App in 2013. While the San Francisco company was founded as a payments platform for small businesses, Cash App has become its largest source of revenue. In the second quarter, the app generated $1.2 billion of Square’s $1.9 billion in revenue. But Cash App has been more vulnerable to fraud partly because of how it handles customers, security experts said. Square has until recently offered only email support for the app, not a phone number for its customers to call. That led some customers to fall for fake help line numbers, like the kind that Ms. Mobley confronted. Venmo, in contrast, has a chat line on its app that customers can use for a quick response. Ms. Anderson said Square began rolling out a phone line for certain customers on Oct. 6. It plans to make the phone line available to all customers over time. Cash App also appears to be more prone to fraud because of how Square has built the business, industry analysts said. In 2017, Square began a marketing campaign called “Cash App Fridays,” which gives money to Twitter users who post their so-called $Cashtag or username. The campaign, security experts said, provided fraudsters with a phone book of potential victims. It also led to copycat campaigns, where people claim to work for Cash App and say they will give away a large sum of money if users first send in a smaller sum. One Twitter account, @CashappG, has been online since 2019 with the tagline: “Hi welcome to Cash App give away! Send money and we will send you double back!” “It gives scammers a ripe opportunity,” said Satnam Narang, a researcher at the security firm Tenable who has  written about the fraud  on Cash App. Posts About Payment Apps on the Dark Net  
 
 
 Source: Sixgill The New York Times Emily Bradford, an unemployed 21-year-old in Washington, said she lost $75 last month after getting a message through Twitter offering her $3,000 through Cash App if she paid an initial “clearance” payment. When she sent the money, the person who messaged her disappeared. She reached out to Cash App’s support email, but hasn’t heard back, she said. “I figured since they were dealing with money, especially others’ money, they’d have a very good security system and customer service,” she said of Square. Ms. Anderson, the Square spokeswoman, said the company had recently added warnings about copycats on its messages about Cash App Fridays. In 2018, Square also introduced the ability for people to  transact in Bitcoin  on Cash App. That has made it easier to move illicit gains off the app because Bitcoin can be sent to anonymous addresses that are much harder to trace or reverse than traditional financial transactions. Venmo and Zelle don’t offer Bitcoin. Cash App’s popularity for fraudulent schemes is evident from conversations and listings on dark net forums and markets, where criminals gather to do business. In August, Cash App was mentioned 10,577 times on dark net forums, up 450 percent from a year earlier, according to an analysis by the security firm Sixgill. Listings for Venmo and Zelle rose around 50 percent on the dark net in the same period. Image Ashley Tolley, outside her home in Travelers Rest, S.C. A fraudster recently cost her $560 on Cash App. Credit... Melissa Golden for The New York Times Ashley Tolley, 31, a mother of three in Travelers Rest, S.C., recently experienced the criminal activity on Cash App firsthand. In August, she said, she received requests on the app from addresses that appeared to be legitimate, but with a letter or two changed. While some of the transactions were rejected by Square, one went ahead without her approval. The thief took $560, which was a month of child support payments from the father of her two youngest children, from her account. Square told Ms. Tolley that she could ask the fraudster to send the money back to her. But the person had already deleted their Cash App account. “I’m the sole provider in my household,” she said. “For that to be gone — I broke down, I was in tears.”",,2023-04-20 16:44:45.488206+00:00,True,,0.733965046429121,When Your Last $166 Vanishes: 'Fast Fraud' Surges on Payment ... - The New York Times,Rise in Fraud As Payment Apps Increase in Popularity.,"The software failure incident occurred in August when Charee Mobley, a user of Square's Cash App, encountered a problem with the app. To seek help, she called what she believed to be a help line for Cash App, but it turned out to be set up by someone who tricked her into downloading software that took control of her account and drained her funds.

Volkswagen  completed the corporate equivalent of probation after a court-appointed monitor said Monday that the carmaker had fulfilled the conditions of a 2017 plea bargain stemming from its use of illegal software to evade emissions regulations. The final report by  Larry Thompson , a former United States prosecutor appointed to enforce Volkswagen’s promise to reform its corporate culture, noted that the German automaker had adopted measures like making it easier for employees to report wrongdoing. It is a major milestone for the company as it tries to recover from one of the biggest scandals in automotive history, one that has cost it well over $30 billion and severely damaged its reputation. Volkswagen, the world’s largest carmaker, pleaded guilty in 2017 to conspiring to defraud the U.S. government and violate the Clean Air Act. The company had  rigged its diesel-powered cars  to meet air-quality standards while being tested, but they exceeded those standards in regular driving. As part of the  plea agreement  with the Justice Department, Volkswagen agreed to cooperate with a court-appointed monitor whose job was to ensure that the company reformed its compliance systems and corporate culture so that similar wrongdoing would not happen again. Mr. Thompson, the monitor, was deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush and later worked as general counsel for PepsiCo. Mr. Thompson said Thursday that “the structures and processes are in place” to prevent future scandals of the same magnitude. “This is a starting point,” he said during a joint interview with Herbert Diess, the Volkswagen chief executive. “The company will need to be vigilant.” The three-year project was costly and time consuming for Volkswagen, especially when the company is trying to make a transition to electric cars. The effort “was a very good investment,” Mr. Diess said. “We had deficiencies,” he said. “The issues he pushed will make us a stronger company.” Image Volkswagen’s headquarters in  Wolfsburg, Germany. The automaker’s win-at-all-costs culture was seen as the underlying cause of the emissions scandal. Credit... Nikita Teryoshin for The New York Times Mr. Thompson said he could not guarantee that there would be no other scandals at Volkswagen. “Volkswagen is such a large and complex company,”   he said. “What I can certify to is that if another problem comes up, it will be handled much differently than the diesel scandal.” Volkswagen has admitted that, after research at  West Virginia University  raised questions about the company’s diesel cars, executives spent more than a year deliberately misleading regulators before finally confessing in September 2015. By coincidence, the Department of Justice on Monday announced a  settlement with Daimler  on accusations the company had also manipulated engine software to deceive regulators about how much pollution Mercedes cars and trucks produced during normal driving. The settlement, which  Daimler disclosed last month , will set the German company back about $1.5 billion after paying civil penalties, repairs to about 250,000 affected vehicles and other measures to compensate for the environmental damage. The civil penalty portion of the Daimler settlement amounts to $3,500 per car, about $1,000 more per car than Volkswagen had to pay in 2017 — evidence, U.S. officials said during a news conference, that the Trump administration is tougher on polluters than it gets credit for. However, Volkswagen was required to buy back diesel cars from their owners and take other corrective measures that raised the total cost to around $15 billion. By court order, Mr. Thompson operated largely in secret, supervising dozens of lawyers and specialists based at Volkswagen’s headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, who oversaw attempts by the company to reform its sprawling organization. Volkswagen employs more than 670,000 people; it produced nearly 11 million vehicles last year. Volkswagen’s unforgiving, win-at-all-costs culture was seen as the underlying cause of the emissions scandal. In 2006, when engineers developing a new diesel engine discovered that they could not meet United States emissions standards, they devised engine software designed to deceive regulators. To admit failure would probably have meant the end of their careers at Volkswagen. Mr. Diess said that the emissions fraud occurred because of “a combination of too much pressure and lack of a speak-up culture.” Among other changes, Volkswagen has created a whistle-blower system so that employees can report possible wrongdoing without fear of reprisal. Volkswagen also delegated more responsibility to lower-level managers in an effort to become less hierarchical. Court documents indicate that some Volkswagen engineers were uneasy about the illegal software, but none approached authorities until shortly before the cheating came to light in September 2015. During official emissions tests, the software activated pollution controls so that the car appeared to be clean. During everyday driving, those controls were scaled back to protect the engine. As a result, Volkswagen diesel passenger cars spewed more harmful nitrogen oxides than a long-haul truck. Volkswagen strives to be more ethical, but the competitive pressures in the auto industry have only become more intense. Mr. Diess acknowledged that he had to be careful not to push subordinates so hard that they crossed ethical boundaries. “This is a crucial point,” he said. “We have to be ambitious. We have to be competitive. We have to push for results. But we have to find a balance.” He noted that Volkswagen delayed by several months the market debut of the ID.3, Volkswagen’s first car designed to run on batteries, which is seen as a make-or-break vehicle for the company. The first deliveries to customers began this month. The engineers who devised the illegal software in 2006 were desperately trying to make a deadline for the launch of new diesel models.

Nikita Teryoshin for The New York Times Mr. Thompson’s final report frees Volkswagen managers in Wolfsburg from intense oversight as they try to survive a plunge in sales caused by the pandemic, and meet increasingly tough competition from Tesla, which is building a factory near Berlin. The pandemic continues to cut deeply into sales in Latin America and some other markets, Mr. Diess said, though sales in China have largely recovered. There are still supply chain disruptions and other problems. “Things are working,” Mr. Diess said. “I wouldn’t call it normal.” Over the past several years there were signs of friction at times between Mr. Thompson and the executives at Volkswagen, a German icon not used to being told what to do by American lawyers. Early in his tenure, Mr. Thompson pressured the company to dismiss managers who were under criminal investigation but continued to hold high-ranking positions. Volkswagen had argued that it could not fire the managers if they had not been convicted of crimes, but eventually relented. There was also some tension over Volkswagen’s refusal to release some documents it said were relevant to pending lawsuits and therefore privileged. “We were able to work through that issue,” Mr. Thompson said. The legal aftermath of the scandal continues to unfold. On Sept. 9, a court in Braunschweig, Germany, ruled that there was enough evidence to bring  Martin Winterkorn , the former Volkswagen chief executive, to trial on charges related to the emissions cheating. At the end of this month, a court in Munich will begin hearing evidence in the trial of  Rupert Stadler , the former chief executive of Volkswagen’s Audi luxury car unit. Mr. Stadler is accused of continuing to sell cars with illegal software even after regulators in California and Washington uncovered the wrongdoing. He and several former Audi managers and engineers will be the first defendants to go on trial in Germany. Mr. Winterkorn and Mr. Stadler deny wrongdoing. Volkswagen continues to fight numerous legal battles stemming from the scandal. It has reached a settlement with most diesel owners in Germany, but some continue to pursue legal claims. The company also faces suits in Britain and other countries, as well as a civil complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States. The S.E.C. accused Volkswagen  of concealing the risks it was taking when it sold corporate debt to American investors even as it was manufacturing cars with illegal software. In August, Volkswagen won a significant legal victory in that case when a federal judge in California ruled that a large share of the claims were covered by an earlier settlement with the Department of Justice.",,2023-04-20 18:55:12.412896+00:00,True,,0.7991742631484046,"Volkswagen Has Kept Promises to Reform, U.S. Overseer Says ... - The New York Times",Volkswagen's Use of Illegal Software to Evade Emissions Regulations,"The software failure incident occurred at Volkswagen, the world's largest carmaker, in 2015.

BEIJING — Right before executives and car enthusiasts could gather in Geneva for the big auto show there in early March, the organizers called it off. As the coronavirus spread, other shows followed suit: Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, Paris and São Paulo. So after a long lull, the first major auto show since the pandemic hit opened this weekend in Beijing, giving automakers a chance to showcase new models and big ideas for the future. Under the pulsating lights, executives and car fans admired new rides from big Western companies like Ford and Volkswagen, and from Chinese rivals. The gleaming sport utility vehicles, sedans and other cars were aimed at China’s consumers, who have emerged from Covid-19 lockdowns with a yearning to spend. The automakers are chasing people like Ben Cao. Mr. Cao, a 33-year-old Shanghai consultant, and his wife bought a dark blue Porsche Panamera sedan in May to replace their Range Rover Sport, then bought a chalk gray Porsche Cayenne in July to replace their Audi TT Roadster. When cinemas reopened this summer with social distancing, they went to see Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet” and “Eight Hundred,” a Chinese war movie. When he went shopping a few days ago at elite jewelry stores for a new ring for his wife, Mr. Cao found that other customers had already been there. “For a lot of extremely expensive jewelry, they were out of stock,” he said. The Chinese economy shrank in the first quarter,  its first contraction of the modern era , but now has  resumed its surging ways . The nation’s factories are once again  churning out goods for the world . Plentiful government lending is  fueling big construction projects . Chinese officials are expected to report next month that growth accelerated during the July-to-September quarter, even while the rest of the world limps along. The recovery in spending started with the affluent after coronavirus lockdowns last spring and has begun spreading to middle-class families, but many low-income workers are still struggling. Retail sales grew 0.5 last month compared with a year earlier, the first increase this year. Xibei, a national chain of mid-price restaurants that were  mostly empty last spring , said that its sales from Sept. 18 through 24 were up 4.5 percent compared with the same days last year. China’s wealthy are willing to shop. Restaurants, hotels and airports are crowded again. Business hotels in Beijing have nearly doubled room rates by eliminating pandemic discounts and filled up anyway. Nearly all international travel is still suspended, but big airports in cities like Guangzhou and Chongqing have almost as many domestic travelers as last year. Spending by customers like Mr. Cao has lifted sales for luxury carmakers like Porsche, which has even flown electric Porsche Taycans from Germany for sale, and  NIO, a Chinese electric car  competitor to Tesla. “Life continues without any big impact from the pandemic,” said William Li, NIO’s founder and chief executive. A big question, when China’s middle class would join in, seems also to have been answered. Sales of large and luxury cars recovered swiftly in April, but compact car sales stayed weak through much of the spring and summer despite heavy price discounting by automakers. Now they have almost caught up to last year’s pace. Public concerns about catching the virus on mass transit helped car sales in the spring, but sales have stayed strong in recent weeks even as those concerns faded. “The cheaper vehicles are coming back,” said Yale Zhang, the managing director of Automotive Foresight, a Shanghai consulting firm. Edward Cai, a 26-year-old Beijing consultant, spent little in the spring. Now he is going to movies — he liked a just-released remake of “The Invisible Guest” but not “Mulan,” the  China-centric epic from Disney . He even splurged on a vacation a month ago to southernmost China. “Much of my spending was put on hold during the epidemic,” he said, “but it’s coming back.” Not all of China’s spenders can say the same. Many low-income workers and recent college graduates have not yet found new jobs after coronavirus lockdowns or are laboring at reduced hours with lower pay. Businesses and consumers in many inland cities are struggling. “The richest regions are outperforming across the board,” particularly export regions along the coast, while the rest of the country lags, said Derek Scissors, the chief economist of the China Beige Book economic analysis. China also has one of the world’s highest levels of income inequality, rivaling countries like Brazil. Prosperous families play a disproportionate role in the Chinese economy as a result. Consumer research by multinational companies suggests that these families are engaging in what they call “revenge spending” after surviving the fear and death of the pandemic. “You discover that life comes to an end so easily, so you want to give something to yourself,” said Jens Puttfarcken, the chief executive of Porsche’s China operations. It helps that China has tamed the coronavirus within its borders. By contrast, European nations are  closing bars and restaurants  in response to an autumn wave of infections. In the United States,  layoffs remain widespread  and many businesses have closed. The Beijing auto show, held every other year in alternation with the Shanghai auto show, has proved a fairly good lens through the years for focusing the strengths and weaknesses of the Chinese economy. It has become more and more dominated by luxury brands, by vehicles tailored to Chinese tastes and by increasingly sophisticated Chinese manufacturers with ambitions of creating global brands. Image Fresh off a coronavirus-fueled contraction, its first of the modern era, the Chinese economy has resumed its surging ways. Credit... Hector Retamal/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The show has also showcased China’s transformation from a technological laggard to the world’s largest market for electric cars, which customers have been snapping up in recent months. Ford unveiled on Saturday a Chinese version of its new electric Mustang. NIO announced an upgrade to the self-driving software on its electric cars to allow them to merge with highway traffic and exit by themselves. Polestar, a joint venture of Volvo Cars and its Chinese parent, Zhejiang Geely, announced plans for mass manufacture of electric cars next year in Chengdu, China. Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar’s chief executive, said the company was building an entirely new factory that it intends to run only on renewable energy. Mr. Ingenlath was one of a handful of top auto executives who flew to China for the show. Just released from the hotel where he served two weeks in complete isolation after his arrival, he expressed amazement at the differences in daily life between China and Europe because of China’s unusual success in suppressing the coronavirus. “In Europe, you would very much avoid handshaking, even though it is the home of the handshake — I’m surprised it is not an issue here,” he said. “People are less worried.” China’s economy is still vulnerable. More infections could still emerge, especially because the virus was stopped so quickly that few people had a chance to build immunities. China has responded to this risk by keeping some precautions in place, even as others, like wearing face masks, have become somewhat less common, especially outdoors. College students are barred from leaving campuses for almost any reason. China is also preparing an extensive campaign this autumn to administer flu shots, to minimize how many people show up at clinics and hospitals this winter with symptoms that might be mistaken for those of the new coronavirus. Another fear lies in the financial system. China’s state-owned banks flooded the economy last spring with huge loans at low interest rates, adding to longtime worries over bad debt. Shares and bonds of China Evergrande Group, one of the country’s largest real estate developers, fell sharply last week on concerns about how it will manage debts of over $120 billion. A third worry lies in the health of small and midsize enterprises. These lack the political connections often necessary to obtain loans from the state-led banking system. Another large outbreak this winter could yet wipe out many entrepreneurs. Image The Beijing auto show consistently reflects the strengths and weaknesses of the Chinese economy. Credit... Wu Hong/EPA, via Shutterstock Lingering social distancing rules mean that service industries are not faring quite as well as manufacturers. The box office at Chinese cinemas was down 57 percent in August from the same month a year ago, although this mainly reflected rules that reduced cinema capacity. But many of the worries seemed far away at the auto show. Liu Xiaozhi, a former car engineer who now serves on corporate boards, said that the country’s success against the coronavirus had allowed consumers to resume spending money freely once again. “In China,” she said, “it is actually quite back to the way it was before.” Claire Fu and Coral Yang contributed research.",,2023-04-20 18:55:24.363255+00:00,False,,,Crowds at the Beijing Auto Show Signal China's Spenders are Back - The New York Times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[29, 33]",287

Some workers are already going back home JPMorgan Chase  sent some of its workers home this week  after an employee in its trading unit in Midtown Manhattan tested positive for the coronavirus, a person familiar with the matter told DealBook. The timing isn’t great.  The news broke days after President Trump brought attention to the investment bank’s plan to bring some of its senior workers back to the office,  inaccurately tweeting , “Congratulations to JPMorgan Chase for ordering everyone BACK TO OFFICE on September 21st. Will always be better than working from home!” (The bank had, in fact, only asked some senior employees in its sales and trading division to return.) Mr. Trump’s tweet politicized a decision that JPMorgan, and other companies, would probably like to make without such fanfare. Jamie Dimon’s reported comments about young people working from home didn’t help either.  JPMorgan’s C.E.O. told analysts with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in a private meeting that working from home “seems to have impacted younger employees, and overall productivity and ‘creative combustion’ has taken a hit,” one of the analysts, Brian Kleinhanzl, wrote in a note,  according to Bloomberg . A spokesman for JPMorgan later clarified that the bank had noticed a productivity drop in all employees, though younger workers “could be disadvantaged by missed learning opportunities.” The bigger story is how it highlights the calculations that companies are making as they bring people back to the office.  The worries about productivity and  weakening social ties  are real, and so are the risks (including legal liability) of virus outbreaks in offices. The case numbers in New York are down, which could make people more comfortable with coming in; the same can’t be said  about London , for example. How much pressure should companies put on employees to return to the office? How will sporadic outbreaks affect workers’ attitudes toward coming in? When, if ever, will workers get used to the cycle of going to the office until a new case emerges and they are told to stay home? Is it better just to deal with the consequences of remote working until there is a vaccine? • A JPMorgan spokesman told The Times in a statement, “We’ve been managing individual cases across the firm over the course of the last few months and following appropriate protocols when they occur.” ____________________________ Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in Connecticut, Lauren Hirsch in New York, Ephrat Livni in Washington, and Michael J. de la Merced and Jason Karaian in London. ____________________________ Image The 737 Max crashes were the “horrific culmination” of mistakes by Boeing and the F.A.A., according to House Democrats.

Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority whip, said that the contentious Trump nominee  did not have the votes to be confirmed , suggesting that fellow Republicans still had concerns. A House report condemned Boeing and the F.A.A. for the 737 Max crashes.  Mismanagement at the aircraft manufacturer and a “severe lack of federal oversight” contributed to the two fatal crashes of the jet that killed a total of 346 people,  according to Democrats  on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. ByteDance will keep a majority stake in TikTok.  The deal to bring Oracle in as TikTok’s tech partner will see  TikTok spun out  as a U.S.-headquartered company in which Oracle and other American investors will own a minority stake. The proposal remains under review by U.S. national security officials, with a decision  expected within days . Kodak’s board claimed ignorance about the timing of stock option grants.  An inquiry commissioned by the company concluded that Kodak’s general counsel had  failed to properly brief directors  on the legal risks of giving options to Jim Continenza, its C.E.O., the day before it announced a $765 million federal grant to make drug ingredients, which sent its share price soaring. U.S. poverty hit a record low before the pandemic.  The share of Americans living in poverty  fell to 10.5 percent  last year, according to the Census Bureau, the lowest rate since estimates were first published in 1959. Still, 26 million Americans lacked health coverage, according to the survey that serves as a snapshot of the economy just before the pandemic recession hit. Image Apple’s new services bundle may become a target for antitrust regulators. Credit... EPA, via Shutterstock Is Apple tempting regulators? Apple announced a number of new products, including  a $30-per-month subscription bundle  of its new fitness program, Apple Fitness Plus, along with its cloud storage, music, TV, gaming and news services. The rollout comes as Apple is under increased antitrust scrutiny.  Bundling services alongside its popular hardware products sparked different reactions from rivals old and new. •  Spotify  warned of “irreparable harm” if regulators don’t act: The music service  said in a statement  that, “Once again, Apple is using its dominant position and unfair practices to disadvantage competitors and deprive consumers by favoring its own services.” Spotify is currently suing Apple in Europe for alleged anticompetitive practices, on similar grounds to  Epic Games’s lawsuit  in the U.S. •  Peloton  welcomed a new competitor: “Friendly competition is in our DNA. Welcome to the world of digital fitness, @Apple,”  it tweeted . Is the new bundle a threat?  Apple’s control of its devices and operating system give it an enviable platform to host a range of services that compete with specialized rivals like Spotify, Netflix and others. Its pricing and actions as a gatekeeper will determine whether it attracts more attention from antitrust regulators (just ask Amazon). A test will come in its foray into digital fitness, a market flooded with streaming classes featuring providers, like Peloton, that have invested in years of relationships with top-tier instructors that are central to driving demand. One final question:  Where’s Apple’s rumored  Tile competitor ? A thankless task Splitting the difference — also known as compromise — is often a wise negotiation tactic. In that spirit, the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus presented  a $1.5 trillion coronavirus relief package  yesterday. It was close to what the White House indicated it might be willing to spend on stimulus, not as much as the $3 trillion House Democrats are looking for and much more than the $300 billion bill most recently backed by Senate Republicans. The bill went nowhere fast ,  swiftly dismissed  by party leaders. DealBook asked the Democratic co-chair of the 50-member Problem Solvers Caucus, Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, about the point of this doomed attempt at compromise. “Ideally, you wouldn’t need us,” he conceded. “But clearly that’s not where we are.” The group’s mission is “putting country first” and “actually trying to govern,”  Mr. Gottheimer said. The goal was to show areas of agreement and get negotiators back on track. The caucus presented a road map it not-so-subtly called the “March to Common Ground” for the next six to 12 months, with “boosters” and “reducers” adjusting the costs of a bill, tied to circumstances (like the discovery of a vaccine). “We represent the voices of 50 million Americans screaming out to Congress, ‘Do your job!’”  said Representative Tom Reed of New York, the Republican co-chair of the caucus. Undeterred by the rejection of his preferred plan, he said he was heartened by the news that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had told the chamber to stay in session until there was a deal, and by signs of a “thawing in the gridlock” from the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows. “Stay tuned, you’re going to see more of this,” Mr. Reed predicted. Image Ursula Burns is helping lead an initiative to add more Black corporate directors. Credit... Denis Balibouse/Reuters Racial diversity in the boardroom: from words to deeds After George Floyd was killed by police officers in Minneapolis in May, a deluge of executives   spoke out against racial injustice  and  pledged to address systemic inequality . Now, the focus is shifting internally, as boardrooms confront their own lack of racial diversity. Advisers and investors are pushing directors to back up their rhetoric with action or face financial, regulatory and reputational consequences. Racial diversity has become one of the most pressing agenda items in boardrooms , DealBook hears. Underrepresented ethnic and racial groups make up 40 percent of the U.S. population, but just 12.5 percent of board directors at the 3,000 largest listed companies, up from 10 percent in 2015,  The Times’s Peter Eavis writes . Black directors account for 4 percent of all directors, versus 13 percent of the population. “This is the singular topic of governance discussions,”  Daniel Wolf, a partner at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, told DealBook, adding, “Boards are going to try and get ahead of it.” Kirkland recently sent a 19-slide PowerPoint deck to clients that highlighted the importance of diversity and inclusion amid increasing shareholder and regulatory scrutiny. “This seems like a fundamentally different time than the other times Black men were murdered by the police, ” said Ursula Burns, a former Xerox C.E.O. who is a director at Exxon, Nestlé and Uber. She is helping to lead the  Board Diversity Action Alliance  to help companies add Black directors, an organization that has Dow, Mastercard and UPS among its supporters. A similar initiative, the  Board Challenge , counts Merck, United Airlines and Verizon among its members. • “You cannot look your stakeholders in the eye and say, ‘It doesn’t affect us, we are color blind, we don’t need to make changes,’ ” said Rebecca Thornton, the head of director advisory services at JPMorgan. More than 40 percent of the requests for board candidates she has received from clients this year asked for people of color, she noted. Shareholders — and regulators — are watching.  When major institutions put pressure on companies to add women to their boards a few years ago, it had a  measurable impact . Now, some of those forces are turning their focus toward racial diversity, hence the warnings about the price of inaction. The evidence of  stronger financial returns  at more diverse firms also helps. Who is doing what: •  California   passed a bill last month  requiring publicly traded companies headquartered in the state to have board members from underrepresented communities. •  New York City’s comptroller  called for companies to adopt a version of the NFL’s “ Rooney Rule ,” requiring companies to consider gender and racial diversity in searches for C.E.O.s and directors. •  State Street  said it would start to ask companies to explain their risks, goals and strategy related to racial and ethnic diversity. •  ISS , the proxy adviser, said it would begin sending letters to listed companies asking for more details on the racial diversity of board members and executives. Image Bill Gates Sr., right, who helped lead his son’s philanthropy, has been described as “the conscience of the Gates family.” Credit... Lucas Jackson/Reuters Remembering Bill Gates Sr. The father of Microsoft’s co-founder  died on Monday  at the age of 94. Though best known in his later years as the man who oversaw his son’s enormous philanthropy, he was also a successful lawyer who played a major role in the life of another future billionaire, Howard Schultz of Starbucks. Mr. Gates Sr. laid the foundation for his son’s charitable giving,  starting with an $80,000 check from what was then the William H. Gates Foundation to a cancer program in the Seattle area. Mr. Gates Sr. laid out his philosophy on philanthropy in his 2009 book, “Showing Up for Life,” this way: Those who claim that the wealth they have accumulated is theirs to pass on without returning anything back to the American system show a shocking lack of appreciation for all that the system and public monies did to help them create wealth. As a lawyer, he helped Mr. Schultz take control of Starbucks.  Mr. Gates Sr. co-founded what became the prominent Seattle law firm K&L Gates and was president of the Washington State Bar Association. One of his career achievements was helping Mr. Schultz beat out a competitor to buy Starbucks in 1987. •  Mr. Schultz recounted  Mr. Gates Sr. taking him to his rival bidder’s office: “All I remember him saying is: ‘You should be ashamed of yourself that you’re going to steal this kid’s dream. It’s not going to happen. You and I both know this is not going to happen.’ ” The investor quickly backed down and Mr. Schultz bought Starbucks for $3.8 million.

It was a  warm afternoon in July, and Hal Fearn was sitting in his camouflage jeep in the parking lot of a mostly empty IHOP in Southern California. Fearn, a physicist at California State University, Fullerton, bided his time by singing along to the a cappella covers pumping through his stereo. He hadn’t loitered long before he spotted a silver minivan easing into the lot. Behind the wheel was Jim Woodward, large gold-framed glasses and a surgical mask adorning his gaunt face. Woodward, a physics professor emeritus at Fullerton, slid his van beside the jeep and rolled down his window to pass a box to Fearn. Inside was a collection of metallic devices with wires protruding from their exposed electromechanical guts. They looked like the type of gadgets an action movie villain might carry in his pocket to blow up a city, but their actual function is even more improbable. Woodward believes these devices—he calls them his “gizmos”—may set humans on the path to  interstellar travel . As the pandemic raged across the globe, Woodward and Fearn met regularly in the pancake house parking lot to keep their experiments going. Funded by a grant from a NASA program that also supports research on far-out concepts such as  inflatable telescopes  and  exoplanet photography , the duo has been developing what they call a Mach-effect gravitational assist (MEGA) drive, a propulsion system designed to produce thrust without propellant. Sign Up Today Sign up for our  Longreads newsletter  for the best features, ideas, and investigations from WIRED. Every spacecraft that has ever left Earth has relied on some type of propellant to get it to its destination. Typically a spacecraft moves by igniting its fuel in a combustion chamber and expelling hot gases. (Even more exotic forms of propulsion, such as ion thrusters, still require propellant.) That’s why  humans have remained stuck so close to home . A spacecraft can only accelerate as long as it has fuel to burn or a planet to loop around for a gravitational assist. Those methods can’t even carry a vehicle all the way to Alpha Centauri, our closest neighbor, in any reasonable amount of time. The fastest spacecraft ever built, the Parker Solar Probe, which will hit speeds over 400,000 miles per hour, would take thousands of years to get there. Woodward’s MEGA drive is different. Instead of propellant, it relies on electricity, which in space would come from solar panels or a nuclear reactor. His insight was to use a stack of piezoelectric crystals and some controversial—but he believes plausible—physics to generate thrust. The stack of crystals, which store tiny amounts of energy, vibrates tens of thousands of times per second when zapped with electric current. Some of the vibrational frequencies harmonize as they roll through the device, and when the oscillations sync up in just the right way, the small drive lurches forward. This might not sound like the secret to interstellar travel, but if that small lurch can be sustained, a spacecraft could theoretically produce thrust for as long as it had electric power. It wouldn’t accelerate quickly, but it could accelerate for a long time, gradually gaining in velocity until it was whipping its way across the galaxy. An onboard nuclear reactor could supply it with electric power for decades, long enough for an array of MEGA drives to reach velocities approaching the speed of light. If Woodward’s device works, it’d be the first propulsion system that could conceivably reach another solar system within the lifespan of an astronaut. How does it work? Ask Woodward and he’ll tell you his gizmo has merely tapped into the fabric of the universe and hitched a ride on gravity itself. Sound impossible? A lot of theoretical physicists think so too. In fact, Woodward is certain  most  theoretical physicists think his propellantless thruster is nonsense. But in June, after two decades of halting progress, Woodward and Fearn made a minor change to the configuration of the thruster. Suddenly, the MEGA drive leapt to life. For the first time, Woodward seemed to have undeniable evidence that his impossible engine really worked. Then the pandemic hit. Woodward turns 80 next year. He is a survivor of stage IV lung cancer living with COPD, and he is being treated for relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma. That puts him in the high-risk category for Covid-19, so when cases in California started climbing, he grudgingly left his lab at Fullerton and hunkered down at home. But he wasn’t going to let a global pandemic stymie his progress. Over the summer, Woodward gradually turned the office he shares with his partner, Carole, into a den that would be the envy of any mad scientist. Hand tools are scattered around Woodward’s desk among boxes full of new ball bearings, stacks of crystalline disks, and scraps of metal shim that Woodward has cut into electrodes. There’s lubricant that costs $175 a bottle, for greasing the bearing rods, and a special glue that has a number for a name. It’s a stark contrast to Carole’s neat desk on the other side of the room, but Woodward says she’s so far tolerated his ad hoc thruster factory. “I should think that having a partner like me would be very trying,” he says. “She has been astonishingly good about it over the years.” Woodward and Fearn film and record the displacement registered by the torsion balance from every test of their Mach-effect thruster. 
 Photograph: Rozette Rago Woodward built a dozen or so devices and handed some of them off to Fearn, who tested them in their shared lab at Fullerton.  Later this fall, they’ll send a device to an independent researcher in Toronto named George Hathaway, an experimentalist with ties to NASA whom Woodward described as “probably the finest experimentalist in the world for this type of work.” Woodward prepared another thruster for the US Naval Research Laboratory, which will also try to replicate the duo’s results. The amount of thrust Woodward appears to have coaxed out of his MEGA drive is tiny even compared to the puniest satellite thrusters in orbit today. But if other engineers can confirm his results, it could be our best bet yet for a human mission to the stars. Scientists have long  dreamed of seeing an alien sunrise. Our sun is just an average star, one of billions like it in our galaxy. Many of those stars also have planets, some of which might have the right conditions to support life. In 1911 the Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, generally regarded as the father of rocket science, was the first to outline how an interstellar spacecraft might go about exploring them. Since then, scientists have proposed using fusion engines, wormholes, massive lasers, and hydrogen bombs to whisk humans across the deepest of deep space. Only two spacecraft—Voyager 1 and Voyager 2—have ever entered interstellar space. Like every spacecraft to date, they were hurled into the void by a rocket and then used small liquid-fueled thrusters to navigate the solar system. They’re now booking it through the cosmos at more than 35,000 miles per hour. NASA has  contemplated an uncrewed interstellar mission  for years, but the only one under active development today is an independent effort called Breakthrough Starshot. It aims to use  exceptionally powerful lasers to propel a spacecraft the size of a fingernail up to 20 percent the speed of light . For humans to make the trip, they’d need a much larger craft—and a propulsion system that, ideally, could get them there within a generation. That species-defining challenge was what captivated Woodward as a young man. Woodward was born in Boston in 1941, the eldest son of a patent lawyer and an astronomer. His mother, the astronomer, gave him a basic fluency in the language of the universe and stoked his curiosity about the cosmos. As a child, Woodward tinkered with homemade rockets, but he didn’t get very far. His younger brother, Paul Woodward, an astrophysicist at the University of Minnesota, recalls a time when his older brother pilfered potassium nitrate from his childhood chemistry set and used it to make a homebrew rocket that exploded spectacularly over their neighborhood. “The story was that my father got on some sort of list for doing that and could not buy me any more chemicals for my experiments,” Paul recalls. “So the launch was the end of Jim's career in rocketry and my career as a chemist.” Still, Woodward followed his childhood interest into a physics undergraduate program at Middlebury College, a small liberal arts school in Vermont. But it was an experience he had a few years after graduating that changed the course of his life. Woodward has been developing his Mach-effect thrusters for nearly 30 years. 
 Photograph: Rozette Rago On a clear night in March 1967, Woodward was stargazing on the rooftop of Pensión Santa Cruz, a hotel in the heart of Seville, in Spain. The 26-year-old physicist was struggling with his chosen profession and had taken a break from graduate work at New York University. He found himself drawn to fringe research topics, particularly those having to do with gravity, which he knew would make it hard to get a job. “It became clear to me simply by looking at the physics department around me that a bunch of people like that were unlikely to hire someone like me,” Woodward says. So he decided to try something else. He had picked up flamenco guitar as an undergrad and even performed in clubs in New York. Inspired by his aunt, a CIA officer who had learned to play the instrument while stationed in Madrid, he headed to Spain to pursue a career in it. At the time, the space race was only a decade old and satellite spotting was a popular sport. As Woodward gazed up from atop his Spanish hotel, he saw a speck of light arcing across the sky and mentally calculated its path. But as he watched the satellite, it began deviating from its expected trajectory—first by a little and then by a lot. Everything Woodward knew about satellites told him that what he was seeing should be impossible. It would take too much energy for a satellite to change its orbit like that, and most satellites weren’t able to shift more than a couple of degrees. And yet, he had just seen a satellite double back with his own eyes. He didn't conclude that engineers at NASA or in the Soviet Union must have secretly achieved a breakthrough in satellite propulsion. Instead, he believes he saw a spacecraft of extraterrestrial origin. “Critters at least as clever as us had figured out how to get around spacetime far better than we are capable of doing,” Woodward says.  That changed the question, he says, from  if  it was possible to  how. Never one to doubt the power of the human intellect, especially his own, Woodward reckoned he could build a similar interstellar propulsion system if he put his mind to it. “If somebody figured out how the hell to do something like that, they probably aren’t an awful lot smarter than I am,” Woodward recalls thinking at the time. “So I thought maybe I should devote a little time to trying to do that.” It was a project that would occupy him for the rest of his life. Woodward completed his master’s degree in physics at NYU in 1969, and he left to do a PhD in history at the University of Denver shortly after. His decision to pivot from physics to history was a pragmatic one. As a master’s student, he spent a lot of his time combing through old scientific journals in search of promising gravitational research that had been abandoned or hit a dead end so he could pick up the torch. “I was doing the history of science already, so I might as well get a degree in it,” Woodward says. “It was an obvious thing to do.” As an academic historian, he’d enjoy the job security that comes with uncontroversial research and still have the freedom to study fringe gravitational topics as an avocation. He accepted a position in the Cal State Fullerton history department in 1972. It’s not like Woodward’s passion for fringe physics was a secret. In addition to a trickle of historical research, he regularly published technical papers in mainstream science journals on arcane gravitational subjects. “It is unusual that a professor of history would set up a research lab in physics, but Jim was recognized as a serious scholar and committed researcher,” says Dorothy Woolum, a physicist who arrived at Fullerton shortly after Woodward. He was particularly interested in using pulsars, a type of rapidly spinning neutron star that had only recently been discovered, to try to detect an unknown and exotic coupling between electromagnetism and gravity predicted by the Nobel Prize–winning physicist Patrick Blackett. Alas, Woodward’s work on pulsars only managed to raise skepticism among his peers. “Many people looked at me as a crank and blew me off,” Woodward says. “I wouldn’t recommend it as a career path.” The electromagnetism stuff was bad enough, but it was Woodward’s emerging ideas about inertia that really got them riled up. Inertia is the resistance you feel whenever you push on an object. (Or, as Newton put it, inertia is why an object at rest tends to stay at rest.) Though ubiquitous and fundamental, no one has penned a full explanation of it. Woodward inherits his  ideas about inertia  from Einstein, who was inspired by the 19th-century physicist Ernst Mach. Mach posited that inertia is the result of the gravitational interactions of everything in the universe. In other words, the resistance from the sidewalk when someone walks on it or from a pool wall when a swimmer executes a tumble turn is partly due to starstuff billions of light years away. Einstein called this idea “Mach’s principle” and incorporated it into general relativity, his theory of gravity. From the start, Mach’s principle was a controversial addendum to general relativity. Some of Einstein’s contemporaries, especially the Dutch mathematician Willem de Sitter, labored to show that his concept of inertia was inconsistent with other mathematical implications of general relativity. But it was the physicist Carl Brans who finally expelled the idea from respectable physics. In Brans’  PhD thesis , published in 1961, he used mathematics to demonstrate that inertia could not be explained by the gravitational influence of distant matter in the universe. After Brans’ paper, “everybody assumed that inertia à la Einstein was not contained in general relativity,” Woodward says. “That’s still the view of most general relativists.” But as Woodward dug deeper into the history and science of general relativity, he couldn’t shake the feeling that Brans had gotten it all wrong. And as he discovered in the autumn of 1989, if you accepted Einstein’s view that inertia was inextricably linked to gravity, it opened up the possibility for propellantless propulsion. Woodward’s views on gravity and inertia aren’t mainstream, but it’s not crazy to think Einstein might have been right all along. “I'm pretty comfortable with Jim's take on it, because it's very historically oriented,” says Daniel Kennefick, an astrophysicist and historian of science at the University of Arkansas, who has collaborated with Woodward. “He is very much motivated by Einstein's understanding of Mach’s principle. It's not at all unusual for an idea to be discovered, rejected, and then later make a comeback.” In Einstein’s famous equation,  E = mc 2 , an object’s energy,  E , is equal to its mass,  m , multiplied by the speed of light squared. That means if you change an object’s energy, you will also change its mass. An object’s mass is a measure of its inertia—that’s why it takes greater force to push a more massive object than a less massive one—so changing its energy will also change its inertia. And if, per Mach’s principle, inertia and gravity are one and the same, then changing an object’s energy means messing with the very fabric of spacetime. In theory, anyway. Woodward realized that if Einstein was right and inertia really is gravity in disguise, it should be possible to detect these brief changes in an object’s mass as its energy fluctuates. If part of an object accelerated at the exact moment when it became a little heavier, it would pull the rest of the object along with it. In other words, it would create thrust without propellant. Woodward called these temporary changes in mass “Mach effects,” and the engine that could use them a Mach-effect thruster. By combining hundreds or thousands of these drives, they could conceivably produce enough thrust to send a spaceship to the stars in less than a human lifetime. How to keep a person alive in space for decades is still an enormous question. But it is a mere footnote to the more fundamental issue of figuring out how to cross a void trillions of miles wide in any reasonable amount of time. By 1995, Woodward’s  ideas about Mach effects had coalesced into a full theory, and he turned his attention to building a thruster to prove it. The design he settled on was simple and opportunistic. A local electronics manufacturer was relocating, and an employee had alerted the university it had some leftover materials on offer. Woodward swung by its old office and snapped up a pile of piezoelectric disks the company had left behind. To build his interstellar engine, Woodward mounted the piezoelectric disks to a block of brass and put a cap on the other end to hold it all in place. When piezoelectric disks are hit with a pulse of electricity, they bulge slightly. This expansion causes them to push off of the brass block and accelerate in the opposite direction. According to Woodward’s theory of Mach effects, the electric current would also make the piezoelectric disks ever-so-slightly heavier. This causes them to pull the brass block toward them. When the electricity stops flowing, the whole ensemble will have scooted slightly forward. By repeating this process over and over, Woodward figured, the Mach-effect thruster should accelerate. Fearn, his closest collaborator, compares it to rowing a boat on the ocean of spacetime. 1  / 4 Chevron Chevron Photograph: Rozette Rago A homemade vacuum chamber houses Woodward’s Mach-effect thruster and test stand. The smallest breeze would invalidate the results. Over the next few years, he managed to coax a few hundred nanonewtons of thrust out of his Mach-effect drive. Most of Woodward’s peers dismissed his nearly imperceptible results as a measurement error. It is not hard to see why—when you blow out candles on a birthday cake, you produce around three orders of magnitude more force than what Woodward was reporting. Even if the device did work, it wouldn’t be enough to move a small satellite, much less a starship. Nevertheless, Woodward’s Mach-effect thrusters attracted the attention of researchers in government and industry. In 1997 he gave a presentation on his work at Lockheed Martin, and a few months later officials from the Department of Energy and Sandia National Laboratories paid a visit to his lab. But funding never materialized. So he pressed forward on his own, assisted by his graduate student Tom Mahood and a handful of other collaborators. Then he found out about the cancer. In 2005, doctors found a 2-inch tumor in Woodward’s left lung. The cancer had spread to his lymphatic system, causing the left part of his face and neck to swell. His prognosis was bleak. His doctors told him his odds of surviving the year were 1 in 3; the odds that he’d live five years were 1 in 100. He enrolled in a few clinical trials to try experimental therapies and had extraordinary results. Within months, the cancerous mass in his lungs had virtually disappeared. The  treatments came with complications—Woodward experienced heart failure and lost the ability to walk without a pair of canes—but he survived. Woodward beat stage IV lung cancer, but the therapies left him unable to walk without two canes. 
 Photograph: Rozette Rago Woodward’s favorite Einstein quote is “Coincidence is God’s way of remaining anonymous,” and his cancer ordeal only reinforced his belief in its fundamental truth. “There was just one coincidence after another,” Woodward says. “By all rights, I should have been dead and gone 15 years ago.” Reckoning with his mortality only strengthened his resolve. On the days when he wasn’t in a doctor’s office, he was in the lab trying to breathe life into his machines. Then a twist of fate led him to team up with Fearn. For 20 years Woodward had had an expansive lab in the physics department, but Cal State Fullerton now needed the space to open a new Center for Gravitational-Wave Physics and Astronomy. “If it had been anything other than gravitational physics, I probably would have resisted,” Woodward says. “But since it was gravitational physics, I was delighted to move.” Woodward found some space in an empty back office that technically belonged to Fearn, who was on sabbatical. When Fearn returned, he discovered he was now roommates with the university’s most eccentric scientist. “I was really pissed off, because everything was a jumbled mess with these big computers stacked on top of each other, and all my books had been shoved into my room,” Fearn recalls. “And here's this strange guy in my back room doing these weird experiments.” At first, Fearn took only a casual interest in Woodward’s experiments. But as time passed, he couldn’t help noticing his roommate’s results were improving. “That’s when I started to get interested and talk to him about what he was doing,” he says. Soon, he was hooked. He offered to help, and the duo quickly became inseparable, a professional relationship that’s part  The Odd Couple , part Watson and Crick. Although he didn’t fully buy into Woodward’s theoretical explanation for his Mach-effect thrusters, Fearn couldn’t resist the challenge. “How many people can say they’re trying to build a propulsion system to send spaceships to the stars?” Fearn says. “That’s what we’re doing here.” Woodward and Fearn have collaborated on the Mach-effect thruster for a decade. 
 Photograph: Rozette Rago The advanced propulsion  community is a small one. Perhaps a few dozen physicists and engineers around the world are working on problems such as fusion-powered rockets and faster-than-light travel. Everybody knows everybody, and as in any small community, there’s infighting and gossip. But there’s also a deep bond that comes with having to convince the rest of the scientific establishment that you’re not  that  crazy. “People will get into shouting matches,” says Greg Meholic, an engineer at the Aerospace Corporation working on advanced propulsion. “But then, when the workday is done or there's a break, everybody's friends.” Meholic says he first met Woodward at an advanced propulsion conference in the ’90s. “The self-skepticism he had at the time was very appealing,” says Meholic. “He didn't ever make the claim that he had  the  revolutionary thing and we’re going to be flying to the stars in 10 years.” After one of Woodward’s presentations, Meholic offered his engineering perspective on his thruster designs, and they’ve been friends and collaborators ever since. So in 2016, when Meholic heard that Woodward and Fearn had teamed up with the Space Studies Institute, a nonprofit founded by the physicist Gerard O’Neill, to start a conference for advanced propulsion, he knew he had to be there. “Everybody who's ever done any research at all in this kind of work was invited to come,” he says. The workshop was held that September in Estes Park, Colorado. It was good timing. Shortly before the conference began, a research paper leaked on an online space forum that purported to show the first strong results from experiments on another approach to propellantless propulsion, called the EmDrive. Designed by  a NASA research group led by physicist Sonny White , the EmDrive was supposed to produce thrust by essentially bouncing microwaves around a closed, conical cavity. It’s the closest thing Woodward’s thrusters have to a rival. Woodward and Fearn also had exciting  results  to share. Their Mach-effect thruster appeared to be producing a few micronewtons of thrust, a record for the device. Even better, three other researchers who had tried out a Mach-effect thruster in their own labs confirmed they had seen it produce thrust, though not as much as Woodward and Fearn saw. The work was enough to earn Woodward and Fearn a coveted spot in NASA’s Innovative Advanced Concepts program. In 2017 the duo secured a $125,000 grant from the space agency. It was the first funding Woodward had ever received to work on his device. Over the years, he had poured about $200,000 of his own money into building the thrusters. “Jim is a master of doing amazing things with next to nothing,” says Mahood, his former graduate student who helped him design and build many of the early devices. As part of the NASA grant, Woodward and Fearn were tasked with both boosting the performance of their thrusters and finding a way to put them to practical use. So they collaborated with the physicist Marshall Eubanks,  an expert on interstellar mission concepts , to design an uncrewed spacecraft that could reach a nearby star system. Their design, called the SSI Lambda in homage to the Space Studies Institute, is an alien-looking craft that consists of a long triangular truss flanked by three heat radiators that protrude from its body like feathers on an arrow. An array of roughly 1,500 scaled-up MEGA drives situated around its middle provide thrust. A  small modular nuclear reactor  would power the thrusters. “The SSI Lambda probe using MEGA drive thrusters is a truly propellantless-propulsion spacecraft,” the team wrote of the design in its report to NASA. “It can travel at speeds up to the speed of light in a vacuum with only consumption of electric power. No other method for travelling to the stars and braking into the target system has been put forward to date, which also has credible physics to back it up.” In 2018, NASA awarded Woodward and Fearn a larger grant worth $500,000. But that welcome development coincided with some bad news from Germany: Martin Tajmar, a physicist at the Dresden University of Technology who had earlier replicated Woodward’s work, had tried again and this time failed to detect thrust. Woodward counters that Tajmar was missing a critical piece of equipment. Tajmar isn’t convinced. “I always had the suspicion that the thrust could be some thermal or vibration artifact,” says Tajmar. “My conclusion after many years is that it’s just vibration.” In early 2019, Fearn flew to Germany to deliver another thruster to Tajmar. He stayed long enough to help Tajmar and his team set up the thruster and run some preliminary tests. Although these tests registered thrust, they were much smaller than what Woodward and Fearn had detected in their own lab. Tajmar visited Woodward and Fearn in California later that summer with more bad news. After Fearn had left, he’d run more tests in different configurations and again failed to detect thrust. “We tested it in his original configuration and we tested it by changing their mounting,” Tajmar says. “You can easily change your vibration artifacts by introducing some rubber or changing a screw, and that's exactly what Jim Woodward is doing now.” But while investigating Tajmar’s results, Woodward discovered Fearn had made a miscalculation that caused the thrust to appear several times larger than it really was. He took it in stride. “Everybody makes mistakes,” says Woodward. Although it explained the discrepancy between their results and what Tajmar saw in his lab, it also made their promise to NASA—to reliably produce tens of micronewtons of thrust by the end of the grant—seem downright impossible. They spent the next six months struggling to get their device to put out more thrust. Then last spring, Woodward realized the way they had mounted the thruster was damping the harmonized vibrations that are the key to producing thrust. So he built a new kind of mount that positions the stack of piezoelectric disks in the center of two rods riding on ball bushings. The results were apparent immediately. The MEGA drive started regularly producing tens of  micronewtons of thrust and before long it was producing more than 100 micronewtons, orders of magnitude larger than anything Woodward had ever built before. “I never thought I would see the day that I would be saying this to anyone,” Woodward says. “I figured we'd still be struggling along in the 1- to 5-micronewton range.” For the first time, the pair could see the MEGA thruster lurch forward with their own eyes. Sure, it was only scooting a half millimeter, but at least it was visible. Seeing may be believing, but Woodward and Fearn both say they reacted to their results with more suspicion than jubilance. “I was shocked at the huge increase in measured force,” says Fearn. He initially thought that the movement might be due to the device’s balance recalibrating, but he says that doesn’t explain how the device is generating enough force to overcome the friction in the ball bearings so that it could move forward. Woodward is also suspicious, although less than Fearn. The movement is what his theory predicts, after all. “I am confident that a real force is present, but I sometimes wonder if it isn’t accompanied by a spurious part,” says Woodward. Whence the suspicion? “Just years of tracking down false positives, I guess,” he says. With ample new data in hand, they’re now focused on getting their device into the hands of other researchers so they can independently replicate their results. Mike McDonald, an aerospace engineer at the Naval Research Laboratory in Maryland, will be among the first to do so. He leads an internal program for independently testing advanced propulsion systems, which has previously shot down promising results from the EmDrive. Like any good experimentalist , he’s skeptical—but it’s an optimistic sort of skepticism. “I'd say there's between a 1-in-10 and 1-in-10,000,000 chance that it’s real, and probably toward the higher end of that spectrum,” says McDonald. “But imagine that one chance; that would be amazing. That's why we do high-risk, high-reward work. That’s why we do science.” McDonald is waiting for his lab to resume normal operation next year, once the pandemic eases, to begin testing. He says the first step will involve simply replicating Woodward’s experiments and seeing if he observes the same signal. Then he’ll begin weeding out possible sources of false positives, such as vibration or the thermal expansion of components. One test will be to let the device run at its resonant vibrational frequency for minutes or hours at a time. If the signal persists, there’s a good chance it’s legit. There’s a problem, though: No one is sure what the right vibration frequency is for the device. When Woodward and Fearn conduct their tests, they cycle through a broad spectrum of frequencies, and it’s only when they pass a resonant frequency that they detect thrust. But that resonant frequency constantly shifts as the device heats up. It also varies with the experimental setup. One of their collaborators, the engineer Chip Akins, is building a custom amplifier that will track the resonant frequency as it changes. So rather than producing a split second of thrust as Woodward and Fearn cycle through the frequencies, the MEGA drive will, in theory, be able to produce a sustained thrust. If McDonald and other researchers are able to replicate Woodward and Fearn’s results, the next big step would be an in-space demonstration of the device. He and Fearn hope to have a flight-ready version of the thruster finished within a year. If an in-space demonstration on a small satellite around Earth goes well, more ambitious missions might await. “Do I feel vindicated? No, not really,” Woodward says. “I’ll feel vindicated if I live long enough to see someone publicly say, ‘Yes, these things really work.’” But even if the community accepts that the thrusters work, that doesn’t mean they’ll accept Woodward’s explanation of  why  they work. “In my opinion there is no merit to Woodward's theory,” says Mike McCulloch, a physicist at the University of Plymouth who has advanced an alternate idea called quantised inertia that he purports can also explain some of Woodward’s results. “I think the experimental results are more interesting than the theory.” Even Fearn, Woodward’s closest collaborator, has his doubts. But he also doesn’t have any other way to explain what he and Woodward are seeing in the lab. “I haven't been able to disprove it, and believe me, I've been trying to disprove it for the last 10 years,” he says. Woodward’s at peace with his critics. If what he’s seeing is real—if his MEGA drive really produces thrust—he is convinced that his theory is the only one that can explain it.“That’ll sort itself out eventually,” he says. But if he was once a skeptic’s skeptic, Woodward now seems almost religious in his faith that what he’s seeing is real. Some of his supporters can’t help but wonder if it’s led him astray. “As time has gone on, Jim has gotten much more staunch in his approach,” says Meholic. “He's literally come out and said at some point that the textbooks are wrong and I'm right.” If it all turns out to be an illusion and Woodward has spent his life chasing vibrations, his colleagues are the first to admit it wasn’t for nothing. “There is a worldwide effort looking at Jim’s devices, because this is really the only game in town at this point,” says Meholic. “It's been wonderful to have someone like him in the community that actually is doing something to advance these things, because that’s what’s really critical."" Whether you think Woodward is a lunatic or a visionary is mostly a matter of your perspective on gravity. A kiss on the cheek or a shot from a gun or a vibration in a stack of piezoelectric crystals either implicates a galaxy billions of light years away, or it doesn’t. The experimental data won’t lie, but if Woodward hasn’t discovered the interstellar engine we’ve been waiting for, he’s kept the dream alive for the next generation of would-be star surfers who might.

,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/your-money/college-savings-529.html,2020-09-05 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,,"Published on 2020-09-04 00:00:00.  You’ve put aside money for college in a  529  account for years. Now it’s time to start withdrawing funds to pay the higher-education bills. What’s the best way to do that? First, a little background. A  529 account  — named for a section of the federal tax code — lets people save and invest for college while avoiding taxes. Money is contributed after it’s taxed and grows tax free, and the funds withdrawn are not subject to federal taxes when spent on eligible education expenses. At the end of June, there were nearly  14.6 million accounts  holding more than $373 billion. And while there’s no federal tax deduction for contributions to a 529, some states offer tax breaks. To protect the tax advantages and use the money wisely, it makes sense to plan for how and when to spend 529 funds. “You want to be intentional in how you pay for things,” said Mark S. Kelly, a financial planner in Raleigh, N.C. Be aware, advisers say, of what expenses are eligible for payment from a  529 plan . You can withdraw money from a 529 for any reason, but if the expenses you’re paying aren’t “qualified,” you’ll pay federal income taxes and a 10 percent penalty on the portion of the withdrawal that comes from investment earnings. (If you are awarded a scholarship, you can take a “nonqualified” withdrawal from a 529 up to the amount of the scholarship. You’ll owe taxes on the investment earnings, but you won’t have to pay the 10 percent penalty.) Tuition, required fees, on-campus housing and meal plans all qualify, as do required books, supplies, school-related special services and computers. If your student lives off campus, you can use 529 funds to cover the cost of rent and utilities — up to the college’s housing allowance, said Lee C. McGowan, a financial adviser in Concord, Mass. (To find that amount, check your college’s “cost of attendance” website or call the financial aid office.) Once you add up all the eligible costs, deduct any scholarships, grants and other financial aid to get the amount you’ll need from your 529. If your income makes you eligible for education tax credits, such as the  American Opportunity Tax Credit , it’s particularly important to plan ahead for spending from a 529. The credit is worth up to $2,500 a year per student, in each of the first four years of college. (Its calculation is a bit complicated: It’s based on 100 percent of the first $2,000 in tuition, books and supplies, plus 25 percent of the next $2,000.) You can’t “double dip” tax breaks, however. So if you claim the credit, you should set aside funds from outside your 529 to pay for $4,000 of eligible expenses. Then use 529 funds to pay remaining costs. “If you’re eligible for the tax credit, you have to pay eligible expenses with something other than 529 money,” said Ann Garcia, a financial adviser in Portland, Ore. Financial advisers differ on whether families should withdraw funds themselves and then pay the college, or have the  529 plan  pay the college directly. Melissa Sotudeh, a financial planner near Washington, D.C., said having the college paid directly from the 529 made it clear that the funds were used for educational expenses. “You want to make sure your paper trail is as clean as possible,” she said. “Paying the school directly is just super clean.” Others, however, suggest that families or students should receive the funds first and then pay the school themselves to avoid any potential confusion about how the funds are classified. Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Savingforcollege.com, said in an email that it was possible that some colleges might misinterpret direct payments from a 529 account as “cash support,” which could reduce a student’s financial aid eligibility. Whichever option you choose, keep good records in case you are ever audited by the Internal Revenue Service and have to document that the funds were used for eligible expenses. Ms. Sotudeh said she printed out the bill from her child’s school and highlighted the costs paid from the 529. What if you withdraw more money than you need from your 529 plan and you want to put it back? Generally, you’ll avoid paying taxes and penalties if you recontribute the money within 60 days. Many families faced this situation this year when some colleges issued refunds for housing and other costs after the coronavirus closed campuses. The I.R.S. granted extra time to reinvest the money, via a  temporary extension  allowed by the federal pandemic relief program. (Students returning to college this fall mostly didn’t need to worry, though, since they could apply the funds to this semester’s expenses.) Here are some questions and answers about paying for college with a 529 account: My daughter may have to borrow for college. Should she spend all of her 529 money before taking out student loans? Families often spend down 529 funds first so they can wait as long as possible to take on debt. But it may be better to borrow as you go rather than waiting until the 529 is drained, advisers say. “I suggest spreading it out over four years,” Mr. Kelly said, referring to the 529 balance. That’s because there are limits on the amount of low-interest federal student loans that can be borrowed each year (and in total). Once you have missed the borrowing deadline for a given year, you can’t tap those loans retroactively. If it turns out that the remaining amount available to borrow is insufficient, you may need federal Plus loans, which carry a higher interest rate, or private student loans, which lack important borrower protections. Under a law passed last year, up to $10,000 from a 529 account can be used to repay the beneficiary’s student loans. So if you end up with leftover money in a 529, you can use the money toward the  student loan  balance. Do I have to spend the money I withdraw from the 529 right away? Generally, withdrawals from a 529 must be made during the same calendar year that the expenses are paid. Families should be particularly careful about spring tuition bills, advisers say, because academic years span two calendar years. The spring term often begins in January, but colleges may send out the bill in December. If you withdraw the money in December, make sure to pay the bill before Jan. 1. Similarly, if you wait to pay the bill in January, you should also withdraw the money after Jan. 1. “If the timing is off, you risk owing tax because it’s considered a nonqualified withdrawal,”  according to Fidelity . Do 529 plans have withdrawal deadlines? No. You can keep funds in a 529 plan indefinitely. If the account’s beneficiary doesn’t need all of the money for college — perhaps because of scholarships — the money can be used to pay for graduate school. Or the beneficiary can be changed to a sibling or another family member so the funds can be used to cover their college costs.",,2023-04-20 18:56:42.724207+00:00,False,,,Tips on Spending the Money in College Savings Accounts ... - The New York Times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[33, 36]",315

Army’s football schedule had been set for years. It took about five weeks of this pandemic-stricken summer for it to come apart. Five home games, like a sought-after visit from No. 5 Oklahoma that was planned more than a decade ago, vanished. So did four road trips. Less than a month before the season’s scheduled start, the Black Knights were down to three games. The greatest rebuilding projects in college football this year had nothing to do with on-field performance. Instead, with leagues canceling or limiting games, the most urgent efforts to resurrect football teams centered on a far more fundamental, widely shared conundrum: having games for teams to play at all. “In normal times, it would kind of be a mind-melting experience where you start to have little panic attacks here and there,” Mike Buddie, West Point’s athletic director, said last week. “But with what our planet has been through since March, it was just another you’ve-got-to-be-kidding-me event.” What emerged throughout college football was an amalgam of urgent unions and stopgap schedules contrived over mere weeks in an industry  accustomed to setting matchups a decade or more in advance . Contracts that sometimes take months to negotiate were sometimes signed within days, and even as the season started last week, a handful of programs were still scheduling or seeking games. “When you lose one, it’s one thing,” said Doug Gillin, the athletic director at Appalachian State, which saw the entirety of its September schedule evaporate before a restructuring. “When you lose two, it’s another thing. When you lose numbers three and four, you’re like, ‘Holy cow, how am I going to put this puzzle back together?’” Gillin’s solution was to assemble pieces from similarly smashed-up schedules: Since Aug. 12, Appalachian State has announced three games for this month, including Saturday’s opener against Charlotte, which also saw its early fall calendar implode. Army has replaced all the games it lost by making moves like scheduling a visit to No. 20 Cincinnati and agreeing to a matchup with Brigham Young, whose cancellations included six games against Power 5 opponents like Michigan State and Stanford. And yet, after all of the horse-trading, athletic directors acknowledged that there is no certainty that their revised schedules will hold. “No one knows how many games may have to be moved during the season,” said  Dave Brown,  a former ESPN executive whose scheduling software, Gridiron, was football’s equivalent of a defibrillator as teams looked for new matchups this summer. An Atlantic Coast Conference game that was planned for this weekend, North Carolina State at Virginia Tech, was  recently moved  to Sept. 26 because of a cluster of coronavirus cases in N.C. State’s athletic department. Other games, like Friday night’s Iron Skillet showdown between Texas Christian and Southern Methodist, have been postponed indefinitely. The first cancellations for major colleges, though, emerged in June, when plans for four games involving historically Black colleges and universities were  scratched . More trouble appeared in July as leagues  canceled their fall seasons  or  winnowed them  to include fewer, or no, nonconference games. And the turbulence escalated in August as individual universities like  Connecticut  and Massachusetts — which compete as independents — said they would not play at all this season. The decisions left many schedules eviscerated. The lifeline, though, was that every one-sided cancellation left a team looking for an opponent. Gridiron, which most Division I programs use to help schedule games, recorded 886 logins over four days in July and August, more than double the traffic on similar days in 2019. Administrators across the country were often focused on three objective criteria: availability, proximity and, potentially, an opportunity for a modest payday. But officials also were trying to assess the likelihood that a prospective opponent would ultimately play — guesses, at best, rooted in geography, politics, virus trends and the football cultures of campuses and their surrounding communities.

Tim Warner/Getty Images “Nobody, including us, was committal,” said Appalachian State’s Gillin. “Nobody knew what the next ball to drop might be and when the dust was going to settle,” he continued. “For some folks we were talking to, we thought we had a good possibility to schedule them — and then it might have been their conference not playing or something like that.” To get through this month, Appalachian State ultimately went with games against two in-state opponents as well as Marshall, the West Virginia university with which it already had future games scheduled. Worried West Point officials, embracing the kind of assess-all-options preparation that would delight the Pentagon, developed more than 200 scheduling plans. Army’s work began in March, in fact, when football executives picked up on chatter that the pandemic could lead leagues to impose conference-only schedules — an unnerving possibility for a football independent, but one that West Point leaders said they saw as an opportunity to perhaps burnish their home schedule or add a television date. “We would have to be nimble, we would have to be very flexible and very creative, all traits that the Army embraces,” said Bob Beretta, a senior associate athletic director and West Point’s football scheduling maven. Army began contacting other independent programs, even floating the notion of playing some teams twice in an effort to fill out a full schedule. The officials wanted to lay the groundwork in case chaos came. Then they waited. On July 8, the Ivy League canceled its fall football season. The Patriot League followed five days later. The schedule kept crumbling, particularly when the Mid-American Conference’s decision to postpone fall sports stripped the Black Knights of three games. In a matter of weeks, Army’s 12-game schedule was down to three opponents: Air Force, Tulane and, of course, Navy. Image Army lost a home game against Oklahoma that had been organized more than a decade ago. Credit... Mike Lawrie/Getty Images West Point officials immediately began dialing and texting other colleges, hoping their earlier outreach would now pay dividends. “Once we lost the schedule, we had a lot of lines in the water, but it wasn’t like we had this master plan,” Beretta said. “It wasn’t like we could go ahead and pick from 10 different opponents and plug and play. It was limited inventory.” But they soon began to nail down agreements. A game with B.Y.U. was agreed, helped along by a commitment by CBS to air it on network television. New road trips were lined up, and reciprocal games were scheduled into the 2030s. The situation, though, remained so fluid that only hours before Army planned to announce its revised 12-game schedule, one opponent withdrew. Beretta, who once served as West Point’s interim softball coach, and Buddie, who pitched for the Yankees’ 1998 World Series champions, came to see those weeks as having a similar rhythm to the baseball trading deadline: months of relaxed conversations punctuated by a frenzied run at the end. All the while, football coaches and players were looking toward a season that seemed amorphous. “Our philosophy was to prepare, don’t plan,” said Jeff Monken, Army’s head coach. “We just needed to prepare generally as an offense and a defense and special teams to be able to execute our base schemes against whoever they lined up across from us.” The players, Monken said, had not particularly cared about the precise shape their schedule would take. They just wanted games. “Our guys just feel very fortunate to be in the conversation and be playing games,” he said. “They get excited about playing football. It doesn’t matter who we play.”",,2023-04-20 18:56:43.662107+00:00,False,,,College Football's Biggest Rebuilding Project Is the Schedule - The New York Times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[33, 35]",318

When the coronavirus shutdown began in March, Vanessa Antonelli and Jordan Epstein of Manalapan, N. J., rented a house in Orlando for a 10-day break with their 5-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son. “We quarantined and ended up staying three months,” said Ms. Antonelli, 38, an interior designer. “The pandemic made us re-evaluate the way we were living. It gave us the time to reflect.” In June, despite being reluctant to move away from their close-knit New Jersey family, they bought a home in Boca Raton, in a new development that is planned like a country club without the golf. And they are not alone.  According to a  Douglas Elliman August report , new contracts for single-family homes and condominiums continued to rise in five south and central west coast Florida counties — after having doubled in July. In Palm Beach County, new single-family and condo contracts remained significantly above levels from a year ago, with a 268 percent increase in single-family contracts over $1 million. In Miami-Dade, Pinellas, and Hillsborough counties, much of the annual gain was at higher price points. Brokers say that many of those moving to Florida are coming from northern cities. For those on the fence, “the pandemic forced the issue, the recognition of advantages that weren’t fully appreciated before,” accelerating migration from high-taxed areas like New York, Chicago, Boston and California to the Sunshine State, said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, the real estate appraisal and accounting firm that prepared the report.

Credit... Josh Ritchie for The New York Times Sales at Boca Bridges, the development where Ms. Antonelli and Mr. Epstein bought a home, have been brisk. Since May 1, usually the off-season for Florida real estate, 102 houses there have sold for an average $1.7 million, said Jill DiDonna, senior vice president of sales and marketing at GL homes, the developer. When the community is completed, it will have 504 homes. “We have seen unprecedented demand from all over the country, but certainly New York, New Jersey and Connecticut,” Ms. DiDonna said, with buyers seeking home offices, larger kitchens for increased in-home dining, home gyms and private pools. “The shifting product needs of the customer, along with the desire to escape urban areas, combined with the tax advantages, created the perfect storm.” Florida residents pay no state income or estate tax, and receive a homestead exemption of up to $50,000 on a primary residence and a 3 percent annual cap on home assessments, Ms. DiDonna said. The state’s population has grown by about 343,000 in the last year, to about 22 million residents, according to  worldpopulationreview.com . Image With time to reflect on their lives during the Covid-19 shutdown, Vanessa Antonelli and Jordan Epstein decided to sell their more traditional New Jersey home. They are moving with their two children, ages five and nine, to a new house with an open floor plan in Boca Raton. Credit... Bryan Anselm for The New York Times Ms. Antonelli said she considered the lack of state income taxes in Florida “a free gift with purchase.” Even with an $800 homeowner’s association fee to cover lawn and sprinkler service and the clubhouse, “life wasn’t going to be any more expensive for us in Florida,” she said. She and her husband bought a five-bedroom, 5,900-square-foot “Veneto” model on a “dream lot” with a lake view for $1.4 million, adding 20 percent for a pool and other upgrades. Ms. Antonelli and her family have temporarily moved back to New Jersey, but plan to move to Florida next June when school lets out, and will rent a home there until their new house is ready in the spring of 2022. “A lot of our final decisions will depend on how everything goes with this school year and Covid in New Jersey,” Ms. Antonelli said. Long a destination of choice for northerners weary of taxes and cold weather, Florida’s appeal rose when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 limited to $10,000 the amount of total state and local taxes that can be deducted on a federal income tax return. Despite a spike in coronavirus cases in Florida earlier this summer, the pandemic has increased the state’s allure. Demand at the wealthier end of the market has swelled “across the major markets of South Florida — Tampa and St. Pete are seeing the same amount of activity,” said Jay Phillip Parker, chief executive of Douglas Elliman’s Florida brokerage, with multimillion dollar sales snowballing in Palm Beach and Miami. Beyond Zoom calls and virtual tours, buyers fleeing urban centers have driven south or even chartered planes to view properties. Some who were wintering in Florida when the pandemic struck stayed. Many rented units “were sold to the tenants,” Mr. Parker said, noting that some statistics may be skewed because the activity was at a normally quiet time. “The pandemic is one of the many elements that have contributed toward what we have always known to be a natural migration,” Mr. Parker added. “We’ve been referred to as the ‘sixth borough’.” In Boca Raton, about 50 miles north of Miami, inventory is low and “demand is outrageous,” said Jared Ringel, an agent at Compass Florida. “There are multiple bids on houses now.” Neighboring Delray Beach, along with Parkland and Coral Springs, where homes in gated communities sell for $600,000 to $700,000, are also popular among out-of-state buyers seeking good schools and restaurants, said Chris Franciosa, another Compass agent. Among the roughly 950 people moving to Florida every day, 45 percent head to South Florida, said Craig Studnicky, chief executive of ISG World, publisher of the 2020 Miami Report. During the pandemic, buyers are “moving much more toward permanent living” than to vacation homes. Many buyers from the Northeast were looking in August because they were concerned about whether “Covid could come back during flu season. If they are going to quarantine, they want to be in nice weather.” Single-family homes are “the soup du jour,” Mr. Studnicky said, accounting for 80 percent of residential transactions during the first six months of 2020. “It is easier to social distance in a house.” But interest in condos, currently a buyer’s market, is inching up with the population swell, with one in three sales occurring near the coast between Coconut Grove and Fort Lauderdale. Image Gaining space and saving on taxes, Andrew and Deena Cromer sold their one-bedroom co-op on the Upper West Side and purchased a five-bedroom home near Coral Gables in south Miami. Credit... Josh Ritchie for The New York Times Deena and Andrew Cromer moved to south Miami about a year ago. Though they loved living on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, their 850-square-foot, one bedroom co-op was cramped. “Our apartment felt like it was shrinking,” said Ms. Cromer, 34, with their daughter’s crib in a bedroom alcove and a son on the way. “Having a two-bedroom wasn’t going to solve our problem,” she said. “The taxes were eating up our paychecks.” Last August, the Cromers sold their co-op for $900,000 and headed south. In December, for $1.1 million, they bought a five-bedroom, four-bath Mediterranean on a quarter-acre lot near Coral Gables. Mr. Cromer, a lawyer who grew up nearby, got a job at a local firm. Ms. Cromer switched gears from fashion to real estate. “You get a lot more for your money here,” Ms. Cromer said, including enough space for New York family to visit. “I was very happy to be here in the warm weather during Covid. We are outside all the time.” As for Mr. Epstein and Ms. Antonelli, it turns out they didn’t have to worry about leaving their New Jersey relatives after all. In July, Sue and Nick Antonelli, Ms. Antonelli’s parents, paid $1.36 million to build a single-story contemporary next door at Boca Bridges. Alexis and Wes Hanas, Ms. Antonelli’s sister and brother-in-law, picked a $1,115,900 five-bedroom house with a four-car garage at Lotus, a neighboring GL Homes development, where houses average $970,000. The entire clan plans to relocate when their new homes are completed. “If the quarantine didn’t happen, we would not have done this,” Ms. Antonelli said.

In March, when a co-worker in Mr. Uzan’s software engineering group contracted Covid-19, Mr. Uzan, 35, began working remotely from his home in Medford, N.Y. After his pay was subsequently cut, he sold his three-bedroom house for $365,000. In July, based on a FaceTime tour with a leasing agent, Mr. Uzan rented an 800-square-foot one-bedroom for $3,050 a month at Society Las Olas, a new high-rise with a huge amenity deck in Fort Lauderdale. This fall, he plans to look for a new job, and he also plans to buy a house in Boca Raton, Del Ray or Parkland by the time his 12-month lease expires. “Everything is more attractive here,” Mr. Uzan said. “I was going to move here when I retired.

Many colleges and universities are struggling to reopen safely and offer in-person classes during the pandemic. At risk is not just the health and safety of their students, faculty and staff, but in many cases the financial viability of the institutions themselves if they have to go to remote learning, which could prompt students and their families to demand reductions. Financial hardships are inevitable for all but the largest universities with multibillion-dollar endowments, and a lack of paying students could force some closings. That raises questions for supporters who have made donations to these colleges using the most popular planned giving tool: a charitable gift annuity. These annuities are similar to commercial annuities, with one key difference. In a typical annuity, you would invest a sum and in return receive a regular payment until your death. After that, what’s left goes to the insurance company as profit. With charitable gift annuities, donors still receive regular annuity payments, but whatever is left over goes to the nonprofit as a gift. They have been working this way since 1843, when the American Bible Society underwrote the first such charitable annuity. Michele Murphy, a retired lawyer in Palm Desert, Calif., who has set up charitable gift annuities at two of the University of California campuses — Los Angeles and Riverside — as well as Loyola Law School, said she was worried about their fate. “We felt comfortable with the risk at that time,” she said. “We understood we were ‘first in line’ creditors if anything happened to these institutions, but felt that if the entire University of California system and/or Loyola Marymount University were in trouble, we would have a lot more to worry about.” But with colleges and universities struggling during the pandemic, Ms. Murphy worries that her annuities may not provide guaranteed retirement income. “In my wildest dreams and speaking as an extremely risk-averse person, I would never have expected that the future of these schools or our C.G.A.s could be in danger because of a pandemic,” she said, using shorthand for charitable gift annuities. With all of the things to be concerned about right now, one bit of reassurance is that experts say these annuities should be relatively safe. Few nonprofits have defaulted on their annuity obligations. Experts say that donors should remain vigilant in how they select the nonprofits that will set up these annuities, but that the risk is still low. “Generally speaking, donors still don’t have anything to worry about,” said Bryan Clontz, founder and president of Charitable Solutions, which manages complicated charitable donations. “They have more to worry about today than they did a year ago. But it’s more of an acceleration of a trend.” That trend is smaller institutions struggling financially. Image Many colleges and universities have moved to remote learning, which might prompt students and their families to demand tuition reductions. Credit... Hunter Kerhart for The New York Times The total market for charitable gift annuities is about $4.3 billion, with about 1,600 charities issuing them, according to Dr. Clontz, who wrote his doctoral dissertation on charitable gift annuities. He said the number of these annuities was larger than any other so-called split-interest charitable vehicle, an investment that provides payments for the donor now and leaves what’s left to the charity later. In fact, charitable remainder annuity trusts, which accomplish the same thing but are often larger and more complicated to set up and give the donor more control, have a total value of about $6.4 billion, but only about 14,000 exist, compared with over 117,000 charitable gift annuities. “The market is quite large relative to other lifetime income gifts,” Dr. Clontz said. What ensures that the annuity payments will be made is the nonprofit itself, and more specifically the unrestricted cash and marketable investments that it has. Just as a commercial annuity is only as good as the solvency of the insurance company that created it, the same holds true with a charitable annuity and the nonprofit organization receiving the gift. Regulations of nonprofits that offer these annuities vary by state. California, New York and New Jersey are considered the most restrictive, with California requiring nonprofits to establish trusts to hold the annuity money, said Stephanie Buckley, senior regional fiduciary manager for philanthropic services at Wells Fargo Private Bank. That trust ensures that the annuity assets are kept separate from the general assets of the nonprofit. Most nonprofits are also guided by the American Council on Gift Annuities, which establishes ethical guidelines but also sets the rates that annuities pay. Those rates ensure that the donors will be paid an annuity stream based on actuarial calculations of their age. That rate presumes that about half of the donation will be left for the nonprofit when the donor dies. A recent survey from Crescendo Associates, which creates software for charities, found that over 80 percent of nonprofits followed the recommended rates. The other rate that matters is the investment return; the recession has driven those rates down. That could be bad for donors expecting a tax deduction on what is eventually left to the nonprofit because a lower assumed rate of return means more money that needs to be paid back as an annuity and less left over at the end, said Russell James, a professor of personal financial planning at Texas Tech University. In an examination of over 100 years of charitable gift annuities, Dr. Clontz said, only a  handful of organizations   defaulted  on their obligations or had their annuity pools moved to different nonprofits when they ran afoul of the law. In all of these cases, the organizations were not operating as legitimate nonprofits. Instead they were selling gift annuities with false promises as a way to enrich themselves. Several were outright Ponzi schemes that offered unsupportable returns. “They were shell entities,” Professor James said. “There was no hospital there. There was no university there. There was nothing other than these names selling annuity products as if they were nonprofit organizations. In those cases, we didn’t have a normal operating charity.” If anything, reputable nonprofits treat charitable gift annuities too cautiously. Joe Bull, the president-elect of the American Council on Gift Annuities and previously a gift officer at Ohio State University, said nearly all institutions that adhered to the council’s guidelines did not touch the annuity amount until the donor died. “The annuity is backed by all the assets of the organization, and the charities don’t want to have to dip into other assets to make the payments,” Mr. Bull said. For many organizations, the gift annuities are treated like bequests that are locked in. Consider George Washington University, which has an endowment of $1.7 billion. Charitable gift annuities constitute just 1 percent of its annual giving, and the university invests the entire amount of the annuity contract in its reserve fund, said Courtney L. Tsai, assistant vice president in the office of planned giving, development and alumni relations. One downside is that donors don’t get to see what their gift does while they’re alive, but a gift annuity is a start or part of a bigger giving strategy. “Many of our gift annuitants also make outright gifts during their lifetime and even create endowment funds during their lifetime,” which the remainder of the annuity can go toward, Ms. Tsai said. Dr. Clontz put together a list of four questions to ask any nonprofit before setting up a charitable gift annuity. One, look at the institution’s charitable filings and determine how much of its assets are unrestricted; this entails excluding all the restricted endowment funds but also the value of buildings and equipment. Two, check that the institution is part of the American Council on Gift Annuities — none of the institutions that turned out to be scams were, he said. Three, make sure the institution is not engaged in any large-scale, active litigation that could result in its assets being frozen to pay out a judgment. And last, do not create an annuity with an organization that offers commissions to other organizations that refer annuity business to it. “That’s how the scammy ones built assets so quickly,” he said. “Surprisingly, most told you they were doing that.” For those still wary of colleges closing during the pandemic, Ms. Buckley of Wells Fargo said many of the smaller ones most at risk might not have charitable gift annuity programs, given the complexity of setting up and managing them. “We’re in uncharted territory with our economy,” she said. “But charities take these annuities very seriously. They don’t want to look bad if they don’t pay you.”",,2023-04-20 18:56:49.360080+00:00,False,,,Weighing Pandemic Risks When Donating to Colleges - The New York Times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[33],333

Weddings are usually associated with joyous togetherness, a time for family and friends to celebrate alongside the couple and with each other. Some communities, though, have their own brand of togetherness. Although considered uncommon in the United States, Muslim couples may opt for gender-separate wedding celebrations, men and women sit separately during the ceremony and celebrate in different rooms during the reception, because of the strict observance of the hijab, which means veil in Arabic. Rules of hijab both apply to men and women even though it is commonly referred to as a head scarf for women. For men, everything between the navel to the knee should be covered; for women, only her face, hands and sometimes feet are allowed to be exposed. “The idea of gender segregation in conservative Islamic circles is actually just one expression of a much broader puritanical ideal of social partitioning between genders in Islam,” said Shaykh Dr. Mohammad Omar Hussaini, a pathologist whose spiritual writings can be found on the website  Pureway . He explained that the hijab “is not simply a piece of cloth but rather an attitude that desexualizes, and in the process humanizes, our experience as men and women, who are like two aspects of one soul.” In the Islamic faith, a woman’s hair is seen as her awrah, or part of the body that requires covering outside the home and in front of restricted adult males. “Most women who wear the hijab do so not only because it is a religious duty but also to show modesty,” said Shaykh Amin Kholwadia, the founder of  Darul-Qasim , an Islamic seminary based in the Glendale Heights suburb of Chicago. “Some women may wear the hijab as part of an identity culture.” Men and women, who are guests, do not sit together at the wedding ceremony, he said, because “it is seen as a ‘time out’ from the usual mixing of the sexes and allows men and women to socialize without observing the rules of gender relationships. Both sets of genders feel a sense of freedom in doing this.” [ Sign up for Love Letter and always get the latest in Modern Love, weddings, and relationships in the news by email. ] Image The groom, Musstaffa Shelo, dances during a private celebration with the men.  Credit... Sami Studios Runna Othman, 26, a talent acquisition specialist who has been observing hijab for nearly two decades, had a gender-separate wedding when she married Mussttafa Shelo, also 26, a financial analyst in Chicago, on Dec. 17, 2017 at Drury Lane Theatre in Oak Brook, Ill. “Although you can act modestly at a traditional wedding, undoubtedly, I wanted a space where women can just celebrate without any barriers,” she said. “At celebrations, especially big Arab weddings with hundreds, sometimes even upward of 1,000 guests, it is hard to maintain a modest composure.” Ms. Othman and the women who celebrated with her were able to let their hair down and forgo their hijabs and dress in ornate gowns that were less modest. “I did not want to wear a hijab on my wedding,” she said. “I wanted to wear a sleeveless gown and to do my hair and makeup. This would not have been possible if I were to have to keep my hijab on during a traditional wedding that wasn’t separated.” Ms. Othman added, “While Muslim fashion has come a long way to include beautiful modest gowns, sometimes a girl just wants to dress immodestly, if we’re being frank.” During her celebration, she said, the women guest were also able to “dance, we sing, we join hand in hand to do debke, which many Muslim women would be uncomfortable to do in front of nonrelative men.” Couples can also celebrate together in a segregated wedding, along with certain male relatives of the bride, including her father, brothers, grandfathers, and maternal and paternal uncles.

Ayah Ashraf Saleha Amreen, 22, a software engineer, opted for a separate wedding when she married Bilal Ghani, 23, a sales engineer, on July 19, 2016 at the Waterford Banquets in Bridgeview, Ill. “There’s a way to have fun without losing your values,” she said. “You can feel like a princess by getting decked out and not worry about any males looking at you.” Mr. Ghani shared that on the men’s side, separated weddings are lively celebration where the men engage in traditional dances that wouldn’t have the same luster if women were present. “It always makes you feel like you’re starting your marriage the right way,” he said, as the separate events comes from a place of receiving blessings by complying with Islamic principles. Danya Alzein, 22, a dental student, managed to have a wedding that was both gender separate and socially distant during the coronavirus pandemic. Her marriage officiation, known as nikah, which is a commitment between the couple to follow Islamic law during their marriage, was initially going to take place in April at a Chicago mosque, but the mosque was shut down because of the virus. Keeping the date and having an outdoor celebration was not an option given Chicago’s cold weather. Ms. Alzein decided instead to have her marriage ceremony in June as Illinois started reopening. The event was held outdoors at her house with a little over 100 guests, with the men in the front yard and the women in the backyard. Food lines were socially distant and everyone sanitized before and after eating. Masks were also distributed and guests had access to hand sanitizers to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. It was a very different type of wedding than Ms. Alzein ever could have imagined. But she is grateful that she didn’t even need to get a special hijab made to match her dress since it was only her father, along with her brothers and her new husband and father-in-law who saw her. “There wasn’t anything I could do when it got changed from April to June,” said Ms. Alzein of her postponed wedding. “It was out of our hands. I knew there was a reason, perhaps some hidden wisdom for the pandemic and that just kept us patient we just took it one day at a time.” Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook ( Styles  and  Modern Love ), Twitter ( Styles ,  Fashion  and  Weddings ) and  Instagram .",,2023-04-20 18:56:51.096878+00:00,False,,,"For Some Muslim Couples, Gender-Separate Weddings Are the ... - The New York Times",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[33],337

Have extra time at home? Want to keep your brain busy with new things to think about? Consider doing a little remote learning of your own. After all, Benjamin Franklin famously  set aside an hour or two each day to study , reflect and experiment so he could fill in the gaps in his own education, and he went on to  several  successful careers. Hundreds of major colleges and universities offer online courses that anyone with an internet connection can take. While you won’t get academic credits for taking free classes, you expand your knowledge — and can even show a little solidarity with your children as they head back to school themselves. Here’s a guide to getting started. Make a Plan First, ask yourself what subject you want to study and how it might benefit you. Are you pondering a career shift? Looking to pick up new skills? Or do you just need a distraction in unsettled times? Make a note of your ultimate goal to help focus your search, as classes are available across a wide range of academic disciplines. Fancy an  Ivy League  education? Among others, you can sign up for  “Constitutional Interpretation”  from Princeton, a  course in African-American history  from Yale or  an introductory computer-science class  from Harvard. Image Hundreds of colleges and universities have made digitial versions of popular courses available online for anyone to study. Studying online means you can attend from anywhere, so you can even go global, like  a project-management class  at Britain’s  Open University  or  “The Science of Beer”  from  Wageningen University & Research  in the Netherlands. Find a Class Many institutions offer lessons in the form of  massive open online courses , also known as MOOCs. These mostly take place in your web browser and include recorded video lectures, readings, study questions and discussion forums. Image When considering a massive open online course, you can check out the syllabus, instructor and other information. Some schools, like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are generous. M.I.T. freely offers the content from most of its on-campus courses on its  OpenCourseWare  site. To see what’s available from multiple schools, try  Class Central , a search engine for online courses. You can also browse the  Open Culture  site, which lists  more than 1,500 courses  from accredited institutions and hosted on educational platforms like  Coursera ,  edX  and  FutureLearn ; these platforms have many subscription or fee-based classes as well. Image If you want to go beyond free access to the class materials, FutureLearn and other platforms that host online courses typically offer graded lessons and completion certificates for a fee. Click the enroll button to sign up. If you’re on the “free” plan, you’re essentially auditing the course. However, if you pay a fee, you can often get graded assignments — or a “certificate of completion” that typically starts around $50. Other Sources for Courses If you’re not quite ready for a college-level class or wish to supplement your child’s learning, the nonprofit  Khan Academy  hosts lessons designed for students in kindergarten through 12th grade. Here, you can find math, science, economics and humanities classes, as well as inventive computer courses like  “Pixar in a Box,”  an overview of the digital-animation process. Image The “Pixar in a Box” module from the Khan Academy explains the science and technology behind digital animation to students of all ages. Apple’s  iTunes U service  hosts free audio and video lectures from schools around the world, although the company has announced plans to  discontinue the platform  at the end of 2021. Get Ready for School An hour a day of study is a sensible goal, but when considering a course, check its specific duration and time commitments so you can plan more precisely and slot the space into your calendar. Some classes are self-paced, while others have a more traditional meeting structure that can last for nine weeks. Image Before signing up, check the estimated time requirements to complete a course and then build that time into your schedule. Find a place to do your homework and keep your school materials. Depending on the course, you may also need certain books, software or other materials. Even if you’re watching recorded lectures, taking notes may help you better retain the information, so ponder a cheap notebook or a  note-taking app . Classes for Busy People Too busy to commit to a lengthy course? The Coursera site has  a list of courses you can complete in a day ; all are free until the end of the year. Image Museum and library websites, like the Museum of the City of New York, can offer recorded lectures and other educational materials for students of all ages. And consider the lectures and webinars offered by museums and libraries. The  Museum Computer Network  site has  a lengthy list of online learning resources  from major institutions. Browsing your favorite museum sites directly for educational content can also yield results. Life Lessons Want to know how to  change the oil in a late-model Honda Civic , perform  basic toilet repairs  or  mend torn clothes ? Instructional videos posted to YouTube provide a  hands-on  education on the practical matters of daily living. Many popular do-it-yourself sites have their own YouTube channels, so you can find content like  The Handyman’s  home-improvement tutorials or  iFixit’s gadget-repair videos  in one place.

Bill Gates Sr., a lawyer and the father of Microsoft’s co-founder, who stepped in when appeals for charity began to overwhelm his billionaire son and started what became the world’s largest philanthropy, the  Bill and Melinda Gates  Foundation, died on Monday at his beach home on Hood Canal, in the Seattle area. He was 94. The cause was Alzheimer’s disease, his family said in an announcement on Tuesday. In 1994, Mr. Gates was 69 and planning to retire from his prestigious law practice in a few years when, one autumn evening, he and his son, Bill, and his daughter-in-law, Melinda, went to a movie. Standing in the ticket line, Bill told his father that he was being inundated with appeals for charity but that he was far too busy running Microsoft to answer them. His father suggested that he, Bill Sr., could sift through the paperwork and, with his son’s approval, send out some checks. Bill Jr. agreed. What Mr. Gates Sr. found later were dozens of cardboard boxes filled with requests for money, many with heartbreaking stories of need. A week later, Bill Jr. set aside $100 million to open what was initially called the William H. Gates Foundation. His father, sitting at his kitchen table, wrote the first check: $80,000 for a local cancer program. Over the next 13 years, while Bill Gates focused primarily on Microsoft, his father managed the foundation day to day, conferring with its executives and philanthropic experts, sending his son lists of proposed grants, writing checks and shaping the charity’s major goals: improving health and education and alleviating poverty in America and the third world. “I consider Bill Gates Sr. the conscience of the Gates family,” said Pablo Eisenberg, a columnist for The Chronicle of Philanthropy. “He was instrumental in not only starting the foundation but growing it, and his motive was that with all that money, you ought to do good.” Image Bill Gates interviewing his father during an event at the 92nd Street Y in New York in 2010. Credit... Lucas Jackson/Reuters In 2000, Bill Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and donated $5 billion in stock to create a successor charity, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Mr. Gates, his wife and his father became co-chairs of the new entity, although it was still being managed by Mr. Gates Sr. In many respects, the modern foundation still dates its inception from his first check in 1994. With Patty Stonesifer, who bridged the old and new foundations as chief executive from 1997 to 2008, Mr. Gates Sr. channeled support for campaigns to eradicate polio, reduce infant and maternal mortality, build schools, foster an agricultural revolution in Africa and invest in technology that created savings accounts for impoverished farm families. Under him, the foundation also gave hundreds of millions to the search for a vaccine to control AIDS, the spectrum of often-fatal conditions caused by H.I.V. “An enormous part of his contribution was not only the strategic focus and the institutional structure of the foundation, but he helped establish the principles we worked by,” Ms. Stonesifer said of Mr. Gates Sr. in an interview for this obituary in January. “He was a daily reminder that just because you have the checkbook doesn’t mean you have the knowledge or the experience on the issues we are trying to address; that we need to listen to the people who have the experience and the knowledge.” Bill Gates Jr. credited his father with the early success of the foundation. “I make sure the resources are available, and he works to wisely spend the money,” he told The Seattle Times in 2003. A prominent Seattle lawyer with heavy civic and professional obligations, Mr. Gates Sr. had largely left to his wife, Mary, the duties of raising their two daughters and one son, Bill, who, all agreed, became insufferably argumentative as a boy — resisting his mother’s requests that he clean up his room, that he stop biting his pencils and that he sit down to dinner on time. Their test of wills exploded one night at the dinner table, with Bill shouting at his mother in what  he described years later  to The Wall Street Journal as “utter, total, sarcastic, smart-ass kid rudeness.” In response, his father, in “a rare blast of temper,” The Journal wrote, threw a glass of water in his son’s face. Young Bill was taken to a therapist, who advised his parents to ease off on discipline. They sent him to Lakeside, a private prep school in Seattle, where he had access to computers. There he met Paul Allen, a student computer whiz. Years later, the parents acquiesced when Bill quit Harvard and moved to Albuquerque, where he and Mr. Allen founded Microsoft in 1975. Microsoft grew into the world’s largest personal computer software company. Its 1986 public offering turned its founders into billionaires and 12,000 employees into millionaires. It became one of America’s most valuable publicly traded companies — the third, after Apple and Amazon, to reach the magical trillion-dollar market capitalization. “I never imagined that the argumentative young boy who grew up in my house, eating my food and using my name, would be my future employer,” Bill Sr. told the Seattle Rotary Club in 2005.

Jeff Christensen/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Bill Gates Jr. announced in 2006 that he would  give up his daily role  with Microsoft over a few years, allowing him more time to work with the foundation. Weeks later, the financier Warren Buffett  pledged to give annual gifts  of stock in his company, Berkshire Hathaway, to the Gates Foundation for the rest of his life. Through 2018, his gifts totaled $24.6 billion, sharply raising the Gates endowment and charitable initiatives. By 2008, when Bill Gates Jr. began working full time at the foundation, his father’s role had begun to diminish after 13 years as the only family member with a daily presence there. For the first time in their lives, father and son were working together. Both were strong-willed executives, but there was no question who was the boss. “At s6-foot-6, Bill Gates Sr. is nearly a full head taller than his son,” The Journal noted. “He’s known to be more social than the younger Bill Gates, but they share a sharp intellect and a bluntness that can come across to some as curt.” The Journal added, however, “He isn’t prone to introspection, and he plays down his role in his son’s life.” In a family line of similarly named men, William Henry Gates Sr. was called William Henry Gates Jr. at birth in Bremerton, Wash., on Nov. 30, 1925, the younger of two children of William and Lillian (Rice) Gates. (After his son, Bill — born William Henry Gates III — became famous, the father adopted the suffix “Sr.,” and the son became “Jr.” to simplify things.) While Bill Sr.’s family was not poor during the Depression, his father, who owned a furniture store, would pick up coal that had fallen off delivery trucks and take it home to heat the house. William attended local schools and was in the Army from 1944 to 1946, rising to first lieutenant in the occupation of Japan. He went to the University of Washington on the G.I. Bill, graduating in 1949, and earning a juris doctor from its law school in 1950. In 1951 he married Mary Maxwell, a Seattle civic leader and longtime regent of the University of Washington. Besides Bill, they had two children, Kristianne and Libby. Mary Gates died in 1994. In 1996, Mr. Gates married Mimi Gardner, the former director of the Seattle Art Museum. In addition to his son, Bill, he is survived by his wife; his daughters, Kristianne Blake, who is known as Kristi, and Elizabeth MacPhee, who is known as Libby; and eight grandchildren. Image Mr. Gates’s photograph appeared in a display on the campus of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle in 2012. Credit... Anthony Bolante/Reuters Mr. Gates co-founded what became Preston, Gates & Ellis, a leading Seattle law firm, in 1964, and was a partner until 1998. (The firm is now called K&L Gates.) He was president of the Seattle/King County Bar Association and the Washington State Bar Association and a director of the Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce, the King County United Way and Planned Parenthood. In 1995, he founded the Technology Alliance to expand jobs in the field. He also served 15 years as a regent of the University of Washington. But his principal focus after 1994 was the Gates foundation. During his tenure, he directed grants that created children’s vaccines; provided sanitation and clean water to impoverished rural areas in developing countries; distributed bed netting to reduce mosquito-borne malaria; supported the education of girls; and promoted contraceptive use, nutritional supplements and single-use syringes. In an age of income inequality, Mr. Gates Sr. argued that the purpose of wealth was not to pass it on to loved ones. With Mr. Buffett and the financier George Soros, he opposed a repeal of the federal estate tax in 2001. In 2003 he published “Wealth and Our Commonwealth: Why America Should Tax Accumulated Fortunes” (written with Chuck Collins). And he campaigned unsuccessfully in 2010 for a Washington State income tax on individuals earning $200,000 and couples earning $400,000. Unlike most philanthropies, the Gates foundation’s bylaws mandate the disposal of all its assets within 20 years of the death of Bill or Melinda Gates, whichever comes later. By 2019, the foundation had given away about $50 billion but still had a $47 billion endowment. Forbes magazine said Bill Gates had $108.8 billion in January 2020, exceeded only by the fortune of the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos ($115.6 billion) and that of Bernard Arnault, the LVMH luxury goods titan ($117 billion). In his book “Showing Up for Life: Thoughts on the Gifts of a Lifetime” (2009), Mr. Gates Sr. wrote: “Those who claim that the wealth they have accumulated is theirs to pass on without returning anything back to the American system show a shocking lack of appreciation for all that the system and public monies did to help them create wealth.” Dennis Hevesi, a former Times obituary writer who died in 2017, contributed reporting.",,2023-04-20 18:56:53.651307+00:00,False,,,"Bill Gates Sr., Who Guided Billionaire Son's Philanthropy, Dies at 94 ... - The New York Times",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[33],344
,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-yoga-studios.html,2020-09-21 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,,"Published on 2020-09-17 00:00:00.  On an afternoon in late July, Amy Quinn Suplina met two of her longtime employees in an airy street-front room in Park Slope, Brooklyn, to box up her 12-year-old business. Sitting on balance balls to deflate them, the three reminisced while arranging straps, blankets and bolsters for storage. Since opening  Bend & Bloom Yoga  in a 1920s firehouse on a residential block in 2008, she had turned it into neighborhood fixture, providing an oasis for yogis of all levels in a striving, strident city. But the pandemic brought all that to a halt. And after five months paying rent, utilities, and other expenses for a space she couldn’t use, Ms. Suplina decided to forfeit her security deposit and get out. She isn’t alone.   Packed indoor classes focusing on breath, touch and togetherness are not exactly happening these days. In response, yogis have embraced virtual instruction, leaving New York’s physical studios struggling for relevance. Since March, dozens of them have permanently closed, from major corporate chains to independent shops. Many owners say the pandemic was the final straw for an increasingly untenable business, where even crowded classes could no longer cover astronomical rents. Some studios and teachers are trying to recreate themselves as online brands but face an already saturated market, where  celebrity YouTube instructors  have millions of followers. Some well-known yoga instructors dominate the online market. Adriene Mishler’s YouTube channel has more than eight million subscribers. “It’s a really hard time, and communities need yoga and mindfulness practices more than ever,” said Ms. Suplina, who was inspired to open Bend & Bloom after relocating from Washington, D.C., where a studio she attended had given her a sense of belonging. As the lingering pandemic strains New Yorkers mentally and spiritually, physical spaces offering them this kind of sanctuary may become harder to find. Public assistance programs have been little help to studio owners, most of whom hire teachers as independent contractors rather than employees. This means that studios could not use funds from the federal Paycheck Protection Program to cover their payrolls. Ms. Suplina said she received only a small loan for her administrative staff. And unlike other businesses that were eventually given dates for reopening, yoga studios and other fitness centers were left out of New York’s plans for months. Last month, when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo issued  17 pages of guidelines  for gyms to incorporate before reopening, Mayor Bill de Blasio excluded group classes. Martin Kerestes, who has run two yoga studios in Queens with his wife since 2003, said there was “no light at the end of the tunnel.” But many owners say the coronavirus outbreak merely exacerbated a deeper problem, the imbalance between revenue and rent. A few older studios, like  Integral Yoga Institute  on West 13th Street, own their own buildings and are less exposed to the rising price of real estate. But most studios rent their spaces and are in competition with ventures that can more easily guarantee, say, $20,000 a month. The pandemic merely pushed Ms. Suplina out of her space a few months early; her landlord intended to sell the building to a condominium developer at the end of the year. Image Since March, dozens of yoga studios in New York have permanently closed, from major corporate chains to independent shops. Credit... Hilary Swift for The New York Times Add that to  an overdue reckoning with inappropriate touching  and  abuse  at a few well-known establishments that left some students leery of in-person classes, as well as disruptive platforms like ClassPass, and it’s easy to understand why yoga studios were starting to disappear well before the coronavirus outbreak. But the health requirements necessitated by the pandemic — including physical distancing, especially indoors — have robbed studios of their lifeblood: rooms full of people. “Our business depended on volume to survive, and now if we say instead of putting 50 people in a room the most we can put is 10 to 12, there’s just no viable way for the model to work,” said Michael Patton, who left a job on Wall Street during the 2008 financial crisis to start  Yoga Vida , which had four locations in the city. Before the coronavirus outbreak, Mr. Patton was paying around $95,000 in monthly rent. He has since broken all his leases and is riding out the pandemic in an empty rural retreat he was developing upstate near New Paltz, for which he is now seeking a partner or a buyer. “The bigger you are, the bigger the problems,” said Brian Cooper, the chief executive of  YogaWorks , a national chain that permanently closed all of its New York City locations in April and is now offering online classes. The pandemic has been equally tough on smaller studios.  Nueva Alma , which  Erica Garcia  opened on the northern edge of the Bronx in 2012, would have been limited to seven students under physical distancing guidelines. So Ms. Garcia locked the doors for the last time on June 1 and is now teaching Zoom classes. “I’m not in it for the money, but I’m not in it to lose money, either,” she said. Yoga requires only a clear mind and a few square feet of space, so it is easily converted to remote instruction. But it’s all about community, and seeing the light in others, which can be hard to do through screens. The disappearance of physical studios means fewer places for “satsang,”   a Sanskrit term for sacred gathering spaces, said Sharon Gannon, who co-founded one of the city’s most venerable studios,  Jivamukti Yoga , and ran it for 30 years before transferring ownership in 2017 (it closed two years later). “But yoga practice itself makes one self-reliant,” she continued. “Yogis are good at adapting to change.” The data bear this out. According to Mindbody, a booking software company for the wellness industry, its active users quickly embraced online yoga. Last year, one in five users said they had taken streamed or prerecorded classes, but by this June, more than four of five said they were doing so. Image Kevin Bigger rearranged his apartment — and his life — to offer online classes after being furloughed by several studios. Credit... Kevin Bigger Studios that once resisted virtual instruction are now embracing it. For the first time in its nearly 60-year history, the city’s oldest yoga school,  Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Center  on West 24th Street, is offering online classes. “One way or another, we will make sure the teachings of yoga are available to those who want them,” said Neeti Bhatia, the studio’s manager. Meanwhile, teachers who have lost their studio gigs are breaking out on their own. Before the pandemic,  Kevin Bigger  crisscrossed the city to teach at nine different studios and for a handful of private clients. Now all but two of his former employers have furloughed him or gone out of business, so he has begun teaching online. The transition required a hefty investment: Mr. Bigger bought a camera, lights and monitors. It has also been a bit awkward to convert his railroad-style Brooklyn apartment into a sacred space. “In order to teach a live class right now, I have to move half the furniture in my living room and lock the boyfriend in our bedroom and ask him to be quiet the whole time,” he said. But there are benefits. He is saving time by not commuting and now keeps nearly 80 percent of the revenue, whereas he usually took home less than 30 percent working for studios. Former students who had moved away have returned to the fold. And because he knows his clientele, he can charge them on a sliding scale, he said. “My unemployed students get discount codes, and the investment bankers don’t.” Sherman Morris , an instructor whose arduous classes at YogaWorks stretched to nearly two hours and attracted a committed following, said teaching online was “the antithesis” of his former practice. But his loyal students have followed him to Zoom. He recalled one, a surgical nurse, who logged in from a tent in the middle of a desert in Afghanistan. “It was priceless,” he said. “How could I not continue with this?” Image Adrianna Naomi started teaching classes on her rooftop, as well as on Zoom. Credit... Hilary Swift for The New York Times Since many teachers are cutting out the middleman as they organize their own classes and build personal brands, studio affiliations also seem to be losing their cachet. Adrianna Naomi , who moved to the city from Puerto Rico in 2013, said she was grateful when she found a stable job as a manager of the Flatiron location of  CorePower Yoga , a chain. So when Ms. Naomi, 30, was laid off early in the pandemic, she worried about losing her salary and the community she had fostered there. Since then, she and other “instructors have had to take matters into their own hands,” she said. In late July she began teaching on Zoom six times a week. And on Sunday mornings, Ms. Naomi runs an in-person class on the rooftop of her Williamsburg apartment building, often having to clear beer bottles left by neighbors the night before. She caps the class at 10 students and charges $15. Everyone must undergo a temperature check, sign a health waiver and wear a mask. Overwhelmed by demand, she added a second rooftop class on Monday nights, but she doesn’t know how long she can continue once the weather turns colder. Although Ms. Naomi’s new schedule hasn’t made up for her lost salary, it has kept her afloat. But marketing herself on social media requires constant hustle. Now, instead of competing with other neighborhood instructors for students, she is doing so with yogis around the globe. “You open up Instagram at any time of day and there’s somebody doing a free class,” Ms. Naomi said. Ms. Naomi has also focused on her social media game since losing her job with a yoga studio. Some teachers are trying to build their online followings through strength in numbers. Mr. Bigger and three other instructors recently launched  Single Point Yoga , a website that bundles their classes together, sort of as a studio would have done in the past. Ms. Suplina has not given up on the old model. She continues to employ about half of Bend & Bloom’s teaching staff for online and outdoor classes while she figures out her next move. The intimacy and reverence that occur in a studio are essential, she said. “It’s another expression of church,” she explained. “The reason we teach yoga is that alchemy of having bodies together breathing and moving in a room, and seeing people, and connecting and sharing that experience.” She plans to open a new physical space as soon as she can.",,2023-04-20 18:56:54.127676+00:00,False,,,Is This the End of the New York Yoga Studio?

Sometimes stocks go down The stock market just had its worst day since June, with a sharp sell-off in tech stocks dragging everything down. What happened? Analysts have thoughts: A reality check:  Markets had rallied  despite broader economic woes , thanks to large tech companies. Some say yesterday’s retreat was a warranted pullback. “The market had gotten ahead of itself and had gotten ahead of the economy, and I think this is a little bit of a reflection of that,” William Delwiche, an investment strategist at Baird,  told The Times’s Matt Phillips . Dealers chasing their bets:  Some traders have  attributed the rise in tech stocks  to a big spike in call options, derivative bets that those companies’ shares will rise. Dealers who sold those options — and bought shares and other hedges to cover those bets — may explain some of the rise in stock prices and a simultaneous jump in volatility indexes, which doesn’t usually happen in tandem. This dynamic also makes the market particularly vulnerable to steep drops, as dealers moved to cover option bets on falling shares, adding momentum to the sell-off. The sputtering economy:  Layoffs remain widespread, according to  the latest jobless claims data , and monthly unemployment numbers coming out today are expected to  show a slowdown in the recovery . “If the mind-set changes from technicals to fundamentals, then this market has further to go,” Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz’s chief economist,  told CNBC . And as stimulus talks remain stalled in Washington, business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are issuing  increasingly dire warnings  about “the cost of inaction.” On the other hand:  Yesterday’s drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq took it all the way down to levels seen … last Tuesday. (Futures suggest another down day for tech stocks, but not as severe as yesterday.) Bloomberg’s John Authers addressed some of the fears that  another dot-com crash  is in the works, noting that the tech giants behind the current rally are hugely profitable, unlike in the late 1990s, which partly justifies their heady valuations. A flood of liquidity from the Fed is another important factor, because “investors have to put it somewhere,” he added.

Moncef Slaoui, the top adviser for the White House’s vaccine program, said that there was a  “very, very low chance”  of such a treatment being ready by then. That runs counter to more optimistic assertions made recently by Mr. Trump and other officials. Facebook will disable new political ads in the week before the U.S. elections.  The social network announced  the ban , along with barring candidates from claiming false victories, in an effort to halt misinformation and interference from politicians. The Trump campaign criticized the moves as censorship by “ the Silicon Valley Mafia ,” while others said the initiative  didn’t go far enough . Malaysian prosecutors dropped criminal charges against Goldman Sachs over the 1MDB scandal.  The move  came after the Wall Street giant agreed to pay $3.9 billion to settle the case; it pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. Juul is reportedly planning huge job cuts.  The embattled e-cigarette maker may lay off  more than half of its employees , according to The Wall Street Journal, and is considering halting sales in much of Europe and Asia. The plans come as regulators crack down on the company and rivals like Reynolds American gain ground. The Korean pop group BTS may get even richer.  Big Hit Entertainment, the label behind the boy band,  plans to go public  at a valuation that could surpass $4 billion. (Members of the band were given shares in the company.) Some analysts are wary that the I.P.O. could value Big Hit at  76 times projected 2020 earnings , more than double its rivals’ valuations.

Mandel Ngan/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Google’s antitrust fight is ahead of schedule The Justice Department  plans to sue Google  over its competitive practices as soon as this month, The Times’s Katie Benner and Cecilia Kang scooped yesterday. But there’s a big question: Is this the strongest case that the government can bring against the tech giant? Department employees were told to wrap up their work by the end of the month,  suggesting that a case will be brought soon. Attorney General Bill Barr has long shown keen interest in the case, Katie and Cecilia report, having taken thick binders of documents with him even on vacation. The department’s team thinks there’s a strong argument to be made.  Career employees came to believe that there is solid evidence of antitrust violations, including Google’s controlling 90 percent of web searches, imposing its search and browsing tools as defaults on the Android operating system and capturing about a third of all online ad spending. But they worry they’re being forced into a “half-baked” series of cases.  “Some argued this summer in a memo that ran hundreds of pages that they could bring a strong case but needed more time,” Katie and Cecilia write. Disagreements persisted over how broad the case should be and potential remedies that Google could take. • Many department lawyers feared that politics was at work: Some confided worries that Mr. Barr may have been motivated by giving President Trump a big accomplishment before the November elections. On the other hand, Mr. Barr reportedly felt the team was moving too slowly in general. A lot is at stake.  The case would be the first as part of the Trump administration’s investigations into the power of Big Tech, as government lawyers also examine whether Amazon, Apple and Facebook have also abused their market-leading positions.

But the business software giant’s close ties to the Trump administration set its influence operations apart from rivals,  The Times’s David McCabe writes . Oracle’s embrace of the White House could be helpful in its pursuit of TikTok , as it bids against Microsoft and others for the U.S. operations of the Chinese-owned social network, which President Trump ordered to be divested on national security grounds. Oracle’s representatives in Washington have also taken on rivals like Google and Amazon with “grudge-match intensity,” David writes. • He expanded on that for us, and on the nature of Oracle’s singular approach to working with Trump’s White House: Oracle’s operation is perhaps best-known around Washington for its ability to engage in protracted campaigns against other companies. Take its fight with Google: It has fought for years with its rival over a technical copyright issue. But Oracle has also engaged in a lengthy campaign alleging it violates privacy online. It’s that aggressiveness — combined with Oracle’s relationships in the Trump White House and elsewhere — that marks its lobbyists’ fights with much larger companies. And as one person said during our reporting, because they run a business that serves other businesses, they can take risks in Washington without alienating customers in a way a consumer-facing brand cannot.

His pursuit of the retailer’s e-commerce operations got him into trouble.  Since 2018, his fund had fought a decision by Neiman’s private equity owners to transfer ownership of its crown jewel e-commerce business, MyTheresa, to other unsecured creditors. When the retailer filed for bankruptcy protection this year, Mr. Kamensky, who was a member of the unsecured creditors committee, was granted an opportunity to bid on MyTheresa. • According to  a criminal complaint  filed in federal court in Manhattan, he illegally pressured an investment banker from Jefferies against submitting a higher bid, threatening to stop doing business with the bank if it did. The S.E.C also announced  civil charges  against Mr. Kamensky. Some key quotes from the accusations: “DO NOT SEND IN A BID.”  Kamensky is said to have messaged a Jefferies banker after finding that the bank was working with another buyer for MyTheresa at a higher price. “They’re going to say that I abused my position as a fiduciary, which I probably did, right?”  After word of their conversation leaked, Mr. Kamensky is said to have called the banker to say that he had meant the bank should put in a bid only if it was serious. “This conversation never happened,” he said. “Maybe I should go to jail. But I’m asking you not to put me in jail,”  Mr. Kamensky is alleged to have said in the same conversation. “Today, we’ve removed the ‘maybe,’ and forced him to answer for his conduct,” the F.B.I.’s William Sweeney said in a statement announcing the charges.

RIGHT NOW, SEVERAL hundred miles overhead, a golden urn with the face of a forgotten man is circling Earth, a passenger on a black satellite. “Enoch,” one of Tavares Strachan’s  most ambitious works of art , is a tribute to Robert Henry Lawrence Jr., the first African-American astronaut, who died in a supersonic jet crash in 1967 before he could reach space. In 2018, after five years of obsessive effort, Strachan managed to launch Lawrence’s likeness into low orbit using a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The project is just one expression of the artist’s dedication to honoring the unseen and the unsung. His life’s work has been a journey into the hidden machinery that determines who and what warrant remembrance. “It’s interesting to look at this body of work — or all the work that I’ve been doing for the past two decades — as a kind of protest,” Strachan said this summer, as he surveyed several dozen large, kaleidoscopic paintings leaning against the walls of his studio, a spacious ground-floor loft on the northern border of Chelsea, in New York. To focus on subjects outside the mainstream canon, “you have to be really committed to it to keep them moving. Otherwise, they usually get swept under the rug.” Strachan’s passion for unearthing obscure trailblazers complements his own audacious feats of exploration. The artist has embarked on four separate Arctic expeditions (he is the first Bahamian to visit the North Pole) and trained as a Russian cosmonaut at a military facility in Moscow — all before turning 40 and without the support of a commercial gallery or an Amex black card. “Tavares has always taken on science and knowledge and possibility in this almost overly ambitious way,” said Eungie Joo, a curator at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and an early supporter of Strachan’s work. “Like, how could you go and train as an astronaut? That’s insane! That’s not ambition for anything that has been done before you — that’s just pure curiosity. That’s a brave curiosity. There’s no one like him in that way.” Sitting in one corner of Strachan’s studio was the work that serves as a skeleton key to Strachan’s expansive vision. Completed in 2018, “ The Encyclopedia of Invisibility ” is both a sculpture and a functional 2,416-page book. Bound in navy blue leather with gilt pages and an official-looking insignia on the cover, it bears a winking resemblance to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, but its 15,000 entries cover a range of subjects rarely found in traditional reference libraries. Urban legends, invented languages, B-movies, mythical creatures and at least one comic-book supervillain appear alongside entries on Haenyeo (the female deep-sea divers of South Korea), Tara Grinstead (an American high-school teacher and beauty queen who disappeared in 2005) and Galiteuthis glacialis (a large translucent squid found only in Antarctica). It’s the kind of stuff “that you would never learn when you were a kid in school,” Strachan said. “The Encyclopedia,” which anchors Strachan’s debut show with Marian Goodman at the gallery’s London branch this month, is playful — luminaries like the Cuban prima ballerina Alicia Alonso and the activist-comedian Dick Gregory brush up against Josiah the badger, one of Theodore Roosevelt’s more unusual pets — but it is also subversive. “While you have people protesting and marching the streets, and people working on a policy level to defund the police or to abolish certain oppressive systems, it’s a necessary layer that artists, writers, creative and cultural producers are also thinking about how these structures can be challenged,” said Christine Y. Kim, a curator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which supported the “Enoch” satellite launch. “Tavares’s interest in unpacking, upending and revising systems and structures of knowledge and history, as he has done with ‘The Encyclopedia of Invisibility,’ represents a perpetual conceptual decolonization.” Image An in-progress bust in Strachan’s studio of Queen Elizabeth morphing into Shirley Chisholm, who in 1968 became the first Black woman to be elected to Congress.

Maegan Gindi The global protests over the killing of  George Floyd  by Minneapolis police officers had just erupted when I met Strachan in June. Frantic to express their solidarity with the movement, museums were pledging to analyze their roles in promoting certain narratives at the expense of others (a 2019 study led by researchers from Williams College and other universities concluded that about 85 percent of works in U.S. museum collections are by white artists). Strachan, however, was excavating marginalized characters from obscurity long before it became an obligation. The artist is now something of an authority on how to tell lost stories: Several conservation specialists from the American Museum of Natural History recently visited Strachan’s studio to discuss how they might acknowledge  Matthew Henson , the Black explorer who, despite having journeyed to the North Pole in 1909 with the more famous white adventurer Robert Peary, is rarely credited. Lately, Strachan has been deconstructing “The Encyclopedia,” using its pages as collage elements in towering works that combine text, found images, painted elements and diagrams. On one table, a photograph of two Arctic owls with orange eyes partly covers a picture of the Jamaican dance-hall artist Frankie Paul, who in turn floats above a dazzling telescopic view of the night sky. These collide with a crossword puzzle, glacial blue icebergs, a basketball and three images of Haile Selassie I, the former emperor of Ethiopia, in military garb on the cover of an October 1952 issue of Jet magazine.

Photo: Brian Forrest Strachan’s approach to making these works partially stems from what he describes as the “gumbo-type” sampling methods of musicians he grew up listening to in the Bahamas —  Jamaican dub  pioneers including Lee “Scratch” Perry and King Tubby. “That kind of making always stuck with me,” he said. Powerfully built, with wide-set eyes and an open face half-covered by a thick beard, Strachan (pronounced “Strawn” or “Stracken,” he has no preference) wore a denim apron, black T-shirt, jeans and a cotton kerchief around his neck — a sartorial choice that predates the pandemic-era need for masks. He settled in New York in 2008, two years after completing his sculpture M.F.A. at Yale, and currently lives with his family in Harlem. The artist tends to speak with the unflappable self-possession of an inveterate traveler, and he discusses his more ambitious exploits with a matter-of-factness that belies the complexity of the challenges he sets for himself. He has spent his life seeking out seemingly unattainable goals with the vehement defiance of someone who grew up being told there were limits to what he could achieve. Talking to him, one begins to believe that anyone who doesn’t attempt the impossible suffers from a lack of imagination. STRACHAN WAS BORN in Nassau in 1979, the second of six boys, in a house that could fit on one of his two studio balconies. His father was an officer and administrator for the police, and his mother was a seamstress and dressmaker. “We were poor, but we didn’t know it,” he said. “No one told us, which is awesome.” The Bahamas was a stop on the narcotics route in the ’80s, and drug money flowed through the islands. “I grew up around a certain amount of violence — not in my home but in the neighborhood,” he said. His response was an early indication of the curiosity and self-direction that have guided his career: Around age 10, he started gardening. Tending plants was an escape, a way to feel calm. Today, Strachan maintains a garden on the roof of his building uptown, growing tomatoes, grapes, sweet potatoes, cantaloupe, corn, eucalyptus and chamomile. As a child, the artist explored New Providence Island, a strip of land just 21 miles long and 7 miles wide, disappearing for hours at a time with his brothers. “I think the sense of isolation, for me, created this kind of imaginary universe,” he said. As a teenager, he spent months at a time on open water fishing for red snapper. Dolphins would burst from the waves, and at night, miles of jellyfish would drift by the boat, glowing a radiant alien green.

Photo: Jurate Veceraite As Strachan grew older, though, he came to understand the limitations of his surroundings. “You could tell that there was a ceiling,” he said. “People who you knew weren’t going off to do unbelievable things that would be on CNN.” The only forms of success were becoming a doctor, a lawyer or an engineer. If you weren’t one of those, “you were irrelevant.” Nevertheless, Strachan decided to become an artist. Telling his parents, who had left school as teenagers to work, was a wrenching experience. “It’s so lonely. It’s not like your family’s familiar with it … so you have this moment where you’re learning a language that they generally won’t be able to speak moving forward,” he said, but “there’s a certain solace in that isolation and a certain magic and beauty in that isolation.” This personal dislocation was underscored by a gradual discovery of why he and his family were in Nassau at all. “The trans-Atlantic slave story is not really articulated well there,” he said. “So you’re just on an island, and you’re just like, ‘All right, something doesn’t really add up.’” Being there, unable to trace his ancestry back more than a few generations, began to feel like being nowhere. Strachan now thinks of his projects as a form of retroactive cartography and a means of reorienting himself. “To me, they all came back to this idea of trying to understand myself, my environment, my community and also the future,” he said. His wanderlust is, in part, a means of coping with this sense of disconnect. “The only way to survive is to embrace exploration, right?” he said. “To embrace being a foreigner.” While studying painting at the University of the Bahamas, Strachan heard about the Rhode Island School of Design as a place where “you can make anything.” He sold a series of small drawings to a local collector to help cover the first installment of his tuition and a flight to Providence, R.I. Strachan chose the school’s demanding glass program because there was nothing like it at home, but also for reasons both practical (“I wanted to learn a skill that I couldn’t lose”) and roguish (“I think I learned it was the most expensive program in the school to run”). Glass is a punishing material to master — the learning curve is steep — and Strachan remembers wondering whether he had made the biggest mistake of his life. “The story of glass is very similar to my story, in some ways,” he said. “It’s a set of paradoxes: It’s fragile, but it’s as strong as concrete under pressure. It’s super precious, but it’s ubiquitous, like it’s everywhere. It has memory built into it. So if you are working on a piece of glass and you touch it, you scar it. You can heat it up again, but that scar never really goes away.” He worked every campus job he could, but it wasn’t enough. Eventually the provost delivered some bad news: If he couldn’t pay, he had to leave. Strachan said that wasn’t going to happen. The provost explained that the school was out of financial aid, but Strachan remained firm, and finally the provost said, “Give me a month. Let me see what I can do.” Eventually, RISD put up the money he needed to stay (Strachan now sits on the school’s board of trustees). The experience of negotiating for his education proved almost as transformative as the education itself. It “became this kind of blueprint moment for my life story, in a way,” he said. “They said no — a bunch of times — and then they said yes.” For his senior thesis in 2003, Strachan sent a light meter to his mother’s house in Nassau, wrote software that would transmit the live readings over the internet and crafted a plexiglass light box that emitted the lumens of his childhood bedroom. “In the early 2000s, for a young artist to have that kind of poetic and conceptual rigor applied in this way was very striking — is very striking even today,” said Joo, who included Strachan in a New York gallery show that year. In March 2005, the artist (who by this time was at Yale) went to northern Alaska and cut a 4.5-ton block of ice out of a frozen river. He shipped it to the Bahamas, titling the sculpture “ The Distance Between What We Have and What We Want ,” and installed it in a solar-powered freezer in the courtyard of his elementary school. Christopher Hoover, an acquaintance with a background in film production, helped secure funding, a ground crew and discounts from shippers. “It didn’t come off as ridiculous,” said Hoover, who became a friend and frequent collaborator, recalling the moment Strachan pitched him the almost absurdly daunting project. “I could tell he was someone who wanted to follow through on those ambitions.” The piece was at once monolithic and mercurial. Delicate fissures would form in the ice and vanish again with subtle fluctuations in temperature. The translucency would change, and so would the luminous shades of blue and green. The students at the school were as stunned by the work as they were delighted — most of them didn’t know that ice formed in nature. It might as well have been a spaceship.

Courtesy of the artist. Photo: Joe Vincent Gray It was the response Strachan had hoped for. He wanted to confront the children with something alien to show “that otherness is OK,” and to inspire a curiosity about the world beyond. “I think being an artist, to me, always had to do with disrupting some system or another, and just putting that piece of ice there … was the most disruptive thing I thought I could have done,” he said. It was the opening salvo in what became a long crusade to expose young people in the Bahamas (and elsewhere) to the forms of knowledge he wishes he had encountered as a child. To that end, Strachan later established the  Bahamas Air and Sea Exploration Center  (B.A.S.E.C.), a community organization where children can perform experiments, conduct research and meet visiting artists and scientists. “With a collapsing educational system and the distraction of tourism, a focus on developing an agency that allows its citizens to expand beyond its waters seems appropriate,” Strachan wrote about B.A.S.E.C. “This project, though difficult for me to summarize, comes down to the belief in the possibilities of what art can do and where it may take us.” In 2011, Strachan launched B.A.S.E.C., which supports teaching programs in the Bahamas with a clothing line exclusively made by locals in collaboration with his mother. That project is tied to Strachan’s training as a cosmonaut at Star City, a complex of Brutalist buildings about an hour east of Moscow. Being there was essential for Strachan, for whom the usual academic definitions of research are insufficient. “I needed to go and experience it versus reading about it,” he said. Every part of the trip was a challenge, from the stomach-churning effects of being strapped in a chair and spun upside down, to the more intangible ones: “It’s hairy being a Black man in Russia,” he said. But physical and mental discomfort “parallels nicely with the project of being an artist.” DURING THE EARLY stages of Strachan’s career, each piece became a strategic means of funding the next one. “If he sold an artwork … it’s not like he bought himself some shoes or whatever,” said Hoover, who noted that he was impressed that Strachan didn’t just want to “do expensive things, but [that] he wanted to do these expensive things to invest in himself.” In the case of the cosmonaut training, Strachan convinced  Grand Arts , an erstwhile project space in Kansas City, Mo., founded by Margaret Silva (a Hallmark heiress), to underwrite the experience. The negotiation process felt familiar. “Rewind back to RISD, rewind back to the meeting with the provost,” he said. “You ask 16 times, and the 17th time, you get it.” Strachan’s refusal to take no for an answer is inextricably tied to the life he left behind in the Bahamas. Seeking hard-to-reach places with no guarantee of success is what motivates him, and the uphill process of blasting through invisible barriers is as important to him as the physical objects that might result. “I do imagine that these actions add up to something, but I think for me the joy of it is the pursuit,” he said. “And there’s a certain pain-to-pleasure ratio in that pursuit, because it’s a super risky enterprise, it’s a risky set of problems that you’re creating and inventing for yourself — and it’s why I think most artists do what they do.” Most artists, though, do not train as astronauts to make work about space travel. Strachan sees artists like Titus Kaphar and Tala Madani — painters who engage, in markedly different ways, with issues of representation and the Western canon — as his immediate peers, but his scientific experiments, adventures to remote destinations and pure ambition set him apart. For Strachan, science is not just a subject but a medium, one that allows him to aim a floodlight at the shadowy reality that knowledge and truth do not just exist in the world but are actively created by society. Science is widely held to be an objective, authoritative discipline, but Strachan’s work reminds us that it is also a subjective, interpretive practice that exists within larger systems of control. “A huge part of scientific narrative has to do with power,” he said. Biology was for centuries used to legitimize racist eugenic theories and colonial oppression, and even now, science remains part of a capitalist structure, one that determines which types of research get funding and support. Image A detail from Tavares Strachan’s “Before the Fire” (2020). Credit... Maegan Gindi On a more personal level, though, creating artworks that double as scientific experiments or feats of engineering is a way for Strachan to navigate the definitions of success that shaped his childhood. “Co-opting that language [of science] became a kind of defense mechanism,” he said. “I always felt like it gave me a kind of authority.” Science and medicine have, traditionally, been avenues for immigrants and marginalized people to enter the academy and gain status and power in the West. Strachan did not become a doctor or scientist in the typical sense, but he has used the authoritative trappings of these disciplines to make people pay attention to his art. “That’s how I managed that question about expectation in a colony where the value of success is placed on law and medicine and science and engineering,” he said. “If you weren’t one of those things, no one really paid attention.” But, he added, “It’s hard to dismiss four tons of ice in a M.I.T.-built freezer system.” “He’s not exactly an artist who works with science or scientists — he’s kind of an artist who is also a scientist,” said Joo, who compared Strachan’s fluency in various disciplines to that of Leonardo da Vinci. “He’s not behaving the way an artist should behave.” IN 2013, STRACHAN’S delight in thwarting expectations culminated at the  Venice Biennale , the world’s oldest and most prestigious recurrent art exhibition, where he helmed the first national pavilion for the Bahamas. “The very idea to have a pavilion would in some ways seem absurd,” said Christophe Thompson, a childhood friend and longtime collaborator, citing the country’s tiny population (just under 390,000 people spread across 700 islands) and total remove from the Biennale. But the idea of representing a place that the art world tends to treat as invisible on its grandest stage appealed to Strachan precisely because it didn’t make sense. It was a means, too, of working through his own conflicted relationship to his homeland. “Thinking about home, for me, it always has a pretty huge air of melancholy, and I find that’s true for a lot of people,” said Strachan. “It’s really hard to talk about. When you’re an artist from the Caribbean and you move to the West, or you move to the States, or you move to any kind of center, you’re self-conscious of the smallness of the place from which you’ve come.” No matter where in the world Strachan’s projects lead him, they are always rooted in his experience of being from a former colony — a place that has, historically, been the object, not the agent, of discovery. His drive to explore remote places and see them for himself upends the old expectation that growing up on the margins means always being the observed and never the observer. The figures he celebrates in his work are people who, like him, have defied the narrow roles they were given and struck out into uncharted territory. Strachan dedicated the pavilion in Venice to Henson, the Black Arctic explorer, who planted a flag at what he and Peary believed was the North Pole. Going to the North Pole in 1909 was not unlike going to the moon in the minds of Western adventurers — it was an astounding place for anyone to have successfully ventured, particularly an African-American man who began his career as a deckhand. Naturally, Strachan had to retrace Henson’s journey. The expedition represented a form of research, but Strachan also sensed he might discover a strange affinity between the tropical island on which he was raised and the frozen top of the globe.

Video by Tom Powel Imaging The North Pole is more of an idea than a real place. The mathematical point might exist, but the spot where all lines of longitude converge occurs on a shifting ice cap that is constantly splitting, melting and reforming itself. Planting a flag at the Pole was a dream that consumed countless explorers who did not account for the fact that by the time they got one upright, it would be in the wrong spot. Just standing at the pole for any amount of time is an unattainable quest — which is partly why Strachan wanted to try. “It’s the truth about most epic pursuits: At the root of it is absurdity,” he said. The collision of human ambition and elusive gratification that the pole represents “is central to everything that I’m thinking about.” The resulting installation included panoramic photos of Strachan carrying his personal flag (a banner modeled on Peary’s, reimagined in Bahamian gold, black and blue) across a vast expanse of white, along with hunks of polar ice, anatomical renderings of Henson and phrases written in white neon. The voices of 40 Bahamian children singing a welcome song in Inupiat, a Native language of northern Alaska, echoed throughout the space, linking Strachan’s island home, the North Pole and a European capital in a web of obvious contrast and unlikely kinship: Rising sea levels may consume both the Bahamas and Venice, while colonial forces have ransacked Inuit land and traditions. Strachan effectively asked viewers to consider improbable cultural affinities in the context of an exhibition born of old, nationalist concepts of identity. Later this month, Strachan will unveil a new installation in Colorado, where colossal neon pink letters will spell out “ We Are in This Together ” on the slope below a gondola connecting neighboring ski towns. Another neon piece, one of his most visible to date, reading “ You Belong Here ,” is already emblazoned on the facade of Compound, a new exhibition space in Los Angeles. The seemingly anodyne expressions are meant to provoke a certain amount of skepticism in the viewer. If neon is the language of advertising and storefront seduction, what are these works selling? Lately, amid the protests, Strachan imagines the sentiments might strike some perpetually disenfranchised people as ludicrous. “It’s a seemingly friendly gesture kind of couched in an array of really tough questions,” he said of the piece in Los Angeles. “Like, who’s the you? How are we defining ‘here’? And who gets to belong?” Belonging lies at the heart of Strachan’s most poignant projects, the works that honor pioneers on the margins of the remembrance. Who belongs on the cover of a high-school history book or on a plinth in a public square? Who makes these decisions? Among the entries in “The Encyclopedia of Invisibility” is Mary J. Bonnin, the first female master diver in the U.S. Navy, who enlisted at a time when there were few women in the military and faced resistance from male servicemen. An expert in both air and gas diving, Bonnin graduated at the top of her class and trained over 1,000 other divers over the course of her tour. In 2010, Strachan completed “ What Will Be Remembered in the Face of All That Is Forgotten (I) ,” a life-size blown-glass diver submerged in a tank filled with mineral oil. “I had no idea that he even knew who I was, so it was kind of a shock,” said Bonnin, who retired in 1996 and now owns a UPS store in Panama City, Fla. “But it made me feel really good that someone would actually take a piece and dedicate it to me. That was kind of fantastic.” At first glance, the vitrine might seem empty — because glass has a similar refraction index as oil, it disappears when submerged. But a change in perspective reveals the delicate human form. Like Strachan’s other unseen subjects, the diver suddenly becomes visible, and her greatness comes into view.

On Thursday,  Facebook ’s AI lab launched a project called  Dynabench  that creates a kind of gladiatorial arena in which humans try to trip up AI systems. Challenges include crafting sentences that cause a sentiment-scoring system to misfire, reading a comment as negative when it is actually positive, for example. Another involves tricking a hate-speech filter—a potential draw for teens and trolls. The project initially focuses on text-processing software, although it could later be extended to other areas such as speech, images, or interactive games. Subjecting AI to provocations from people is intended to give a truer measure of the intelligence (and stupidity) of  artificial intelligence , and provide data that can improve it. Researchers typically compare algorithms by scoring how accurately they label images or answer multiple choice questions on standard collections of data, known as benchmarks. Facebook researcher Douwe Kiela says those tests don’t really measure what he and others in the field care about. “The thing we’re really interested in is how often it makes mistakes when it interacts with a person,” he says. “With current benchmarks it looks like we’re amazing at doing language in AI, and that’s very misleading, because we still have a lot to do.” The researchers hope analyzing cases where AI was snookered by people will make algorithms less dupable. Kiela hopes AI experts and ordinary netizens alike will find it fun to log on to spar with AI and earn virtual badges, but the platform will also let researchers pay for contributions through Amazon’s crowdsourcing service Mechanical Turk. AI labs at Stanford, University of North Carolina, and University College London will all maintain artificial intelligence tests on the Dynabench platform. “The thing we’re really interested in is how often it makes mistakes when it interacts with a person.” Douwe Kiela, Facebook researcher Facebook’s project comes as more AI researchers, including the  social network’s VP of artificial intelligence , say the field needs to  broaden its horizons  if computers are to become capable of handling complex, real-world situations. In the past eight years, breakthroughs in an AI technique called  deep learning  have brought consumers speech recognition that mostly works, phones that auto-sort dog photos, and some hilarious Snapchat filters. Algorithms can unspool  eerily limpid text . Yet deep learning software stumbles in situations outside its narrow training. The best text-processing algorithms can still be tripped up by the  nuances of language , such as sarcasm, or how cultural context can shift the meaning of words. Those are major challenges for Facebook’s  hate-speech   detectors . Text generators often spew nonsensical sentences  adrift from reality . Those limitations can be hard to see if you look at the standard benchmarks used in AI research. Some tests of AI reading comprehension have had to be redesigned and made more challenging in recent years because algorithms figured out how to score so highly,  even surpassing humans . The WIRED Guide to Artificial Intelligence Supersmart algorithms won't take all the jobs, But they are learning faster than ever, doing everything from medical diagnostics to serving up ads. By  Tom Simonite Yejin Choi, a professor at the University of Washington and research manager at the Allen Institute for AI, says such results are deceptive. The statistical might of machine-learning algorithms can discover tiny correlations in test data sets, undetectable by people, that reveal correct answers without requiring a human’s wider understanding of the world. “We are seeing a  Clever Hans  situation,” she says, referring to the horse who faked numeracy by reading human body language. More AI researchers are now seeking alternate ways to  measure and spur progress . Choi has tested some of her own, including one that  scores text-generation algorithms  by how well their responses to Reddit posts rank against those from people. Other researchers have  experimented  with having humans try to  trick text algorithms , showing how examples collected this way can make AI systems improve. Algorithms tend to look less smart when pitted against those more challenging tests, and Choi expects to see a similar pattern on Facebook’s new Dynabench platform. Projects that strip away AI emperors’ clothes could jolt researchers into exploring fresher ideas that lead to breakthroughs. “It will challenge the community to think harder about how learning should really take place with AI,” Choi says. “We need to be more creative.” More Great WIRED Stories 📩 Want the latest on tech, science, and more?

Want this delivered to your inbox each day?  Sign up here . ‘Can you believe that?’ Oracle and  TikTok’s  parent company, ByteDance, may have thought they had struck a deal that appeases both the Trump administration and Beijing. But  eyebrow-raising comments  by President Trump at a news conference yesterday suggest that  it’s too early to tell , even as the White House’s deadline for TikTok to sell itself or get shut down is days away. Mr. Trump said he wasn’t yet prepared to sign off on the deal.  “They’re giving me studies on the deal — it has to be 100 percent as far as national security is concerned,” he told reporters. “No, I’m not prepared to sign off on anything.” He’ll be briefed on the latest proposal this morning. What about that “big payment” to the Treasury?  When asked whether the Oracle deal would include a payment to the U.S. government that Mr. Trump called for early in the process — a demand that took the business community by surprise — he answered, “Amazingly, I find that you’re not allowed to do that.” He implied that the companies were willing to pay, an extraordinary suggestion in itself, and said: I’m saying, wait a minute, they’re willing to make a big payment to the government, and we’re not allowed to take the money? When does this happen? How foolish can we be? So we’re going to, we’re looking into that right now. You understand that? In other words, I said I want a big chunk of that money to go to the United States government, because we made it possible. And the lawyers come back to me and they say, ‘Well, there’s no way of doing that.’ You know why? Because nobody’s ever heard of that before, nobody’s ever said that before. Nobody’s ever said, ‘Well we’ll approve the deal, but we want a lot of money to go to the government, because by approving the deal we’re making the deal valuable.’ They’ve never heard of that before. OK? Can you believe that? There is plenty of other unsettled business.  Trump administration officials now  want U.S. companies to own a majority stake  in TikTok, going against ByteDance’s — and,  presumably, Beijing’s  — desire to maintain control of the business. Asked whether he would favor ByteDance’s retaining control, Mr. Trump said, “Conceptually, I don’t like that.” Other issues that are still up in the air: • Whether Walmart (or others) will join the Oracle consortium. Two people said the retail giant was likely to team up with the group. Senator Tom Cotton, who represents Walmart’s home state of Arkansas and is a notable hawk on China, has expressed skepticism about the deal but is waiting for see final details before coming out with a definitive stance. • Whether other Republican lawmakers will step up their opposition, after Senators Marco Rubio of Florida, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and John Cornyn of Texas said they might favor banning TikTok in the U.S. rather than letting ByteDance maintain control. • Who will run TikTok, since Kevin Mayer stepped down as C.E.O. last month. Vanessa Pappas, the company’s head of North America since 2018, is leading the company  in the interim , but executives are considering bringing in an outsider. People involved in the negotiations tell DealBook they’re exasperated,  given the president’s mercurial wants, the hard line taken by Beijing and constantly shifting commercial terms. Asked what will happen next, one source sighed: “Who the hell knows?” ____________________________ Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in Connecticut, Lauren Hirsch in New York, Ephrat Livni in Washington, and Michael J. de la Merced and Jason Karaian in London. ____________________________ Image A defense of face masks by Dr. Robert Redfield, the C.D.C. director, drew a rebuke from President Trump.

The central bank plans to  leave rates near zero  through at least 2023 and tolerate periods of higher inflation. Two Fed presidents voted against the plan, for different reasons: Robert Kaplan of Dallas wants more flexibility in setting rates, while Neel Kashkari of Minnesota wants a stronger commitment to keeping rates low for longer. LVMH wants to delay its legal fight with Tiffany.  The French conglomerate  opposed an expedited trial  over its effort to walk away from its $16.2 billion deal to buy Tiffany. The New York-based jeweler argued that the move was an  effort to run out the clock  on their merger agreement, which expires on Nov. 24. U.S. retail sales growth is slowing.  Spending climbed for a fourth straight month in August, but there are signs that the expiry of economic stimulus is  taking a toll . President Trump rejected the C.D.C. chief’s comments on Covid-19 vaccines and face masks.  Dr. Robert Redfield, the head of the C.D.C., told a Senate panel that vaccines probably wouldn’t be distributed widely until next summer, and that wearing face masks was crucial. Mr. Trump  later asserted  that a vaccine could be available within weeks and played down the usefulness of masks. Short-term thinking is leading to “really dumb decisions,” says Jamie Dimon.  The JPMorgan Chase C.E.O.  told a CNBC-moderated panel  that governments aren’t taking steps to bring about healthy economic growth, including addressing income inequality. “What we focus on is blaming each other and we stifle ourselves, because we are unable to do very basic stuff,” he said. Image See you next summer. Credit... Justin Lane/EPA-EFE, via Rex, via Shutterstock, via  The growing divide over remote working Whether — and how — to bring workers back to the office (however that’s defined)  remains a contentious issue . Here’s the latest on how some big companies are managing it. In the cautious camp: •  Deutsche Bank  told its U.S. employees that they aren’t expected back at the office  until next summer , noting “understandable concerns about public transportation, cleanliness, security and other quality-of-life issues.” •  Facebook  is looking to  hire a director of remote working  as it carries out a plan to let employees permanently work from home. In the other camp: •  JPMorgan  has reportedly stopped letting junior traders expense Uber rides to the office, ending a measure meant to help them avoid taking public transportation,  Bloomberg reports . • And in a different work arena, the  Big Ten college football  conference plans to play as soon as next month, reversing a decision to put the season off until next year. The announcement comes despite Louisiana State University’s football coach, Ed Orgeron, having  casually acknowledged  on Tuesday that “most” of his team had contracted Covid-19. Snowflake’s blizzard of riches Shares in Snowflake, the data storage and analytics provider,  more than doubled  in their stock-market debut, making it the biggest I.P.O. ever for a software company. It’s the latest sign that investors’  appetite for tech companies  seems insatiable. The arc of Snowflake’s first day of trading:  After its underwriters priced its shares at $120 apiece, the stock opened at $245, rose as high as $319 and closed at $254. That values the company at more than $70 billion, which is about the same as Goldman Sachs. (Another tech company that went public yesterday, JFrog, saw its share price jump 50 percent from its I.P.O. level.) Excitement for all things from Silicon Valley has powered a boom in tech investing , especially during the pandemic, which has made people more reliant on the internet for work and life. That means  rapidly amassing wealth  for executives like Snowflake’s C.E.O., Frank Slootman, whose stake is now worth billions, and investors like Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Iconiq Capital, both of which have invested several times in Snowflake. Snowflake’s first-day pop also gives ammo to critics of traditional I.P.O.s.  Silicon Valley executives like the venture capitalist  Bill Gurley  have argued that such offerings tend to underprice companies’ shares, leaving billions of funds on the table. That view, as  summed up in a tweet  by the Zillow co-founder Spencer Rascoff: “On the one hand, congrats on the I.P.O. On the other hand, 🤦.” • Expect to see more companies explore going public by  merging with blank-check companies  (which are still  raising hundreds of millions ) or by directly listing their stocks. Image Patrik Frisk, Under Armour’s chief. Credit... Olivier Douliery/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Under Armour’s C.E.O. has a singular perspective on voting This year’s presidential election will be the first for Patrik Frisk as a U.S. citizen, and the Swedish-born chief executive of Under Armour is marking it with a major get-out-the-vote initiative by the sports apparel business. His efforts have included encouraging employees and customers to vote by limiting internal meetings and deadlines on Election Day, putting voter registration information on product receipts and adding features about voting to the company’s app. DealBook spoke with Mr. Frisk about voting, the pandemic’s impact on business and the status of Under Armour’s turnaround. On whether Under Armour is worried about political backlash to its voting drive: “We might be judged by it, but so be it. I don’t mind,” he said. “We think it’s partly our role as a brand.” “This absolutely has nothing to do with party lines or anything like that,” he said. “This has to do with the fact that we stand for equality, the fact that we believe in democracy as a brand.” On the difference between voting in the U.S. and his native Sweden, where turnout in 2018 was nearly 90 percent: “I just think voting should be easier for everyone in the U.S.,” he said. In Sweden, “it’s very simple: I get my ballot mailed to me, and you can choose to mail it in or go vote with it.” On how the pandemic has affected the company’s latest restructuring, which it  recently updated  to include more layoffs and cost cuts: “The fact that team sports didn’t happen in the fall, the fact that ‘back to school’ didn’t really happen this fall is something everyone dealing with,” he said. Under Armour has focused its turnaround on bringing new products more quickly to market and  repositioning its brand . It is seeing positive signs in international markets, Mr. Frisk said. He declined to comment on  investigations into the company’s accounting practices. On which pandemic consumer trends will endure: “We think for sure, the e-commerce and digital evolution probably accelerated three to five years,” he said, though how other changes — like a tentative return to cities — will affect business are less clear. One silver lining: “People are going to think even more about their health and wellness level coming out of this.” On bringing employees back to the office: “It’s not going to be the same, at least not in the U.S. and Europe, that’s for sure,” he said. Some employees may need to go back to the office because of the nature of their positions, but others may stay remote for longer — or permanently. The company is taking a “soft opening” approach, allowing workers to stay at home until at least January. “We’ll be setting ourselves up to manage through whatever ‘normal’ we need to have to be successful,” Mr. Frisk said. Image Credit... Christopher Lee for The New York Times Are the Supreme Court’s live broadcasts here to stay? The U.S. Supreme Court will livestream its arguments in October, making the usually exclusive hearings accessible to all. When the court first aired live audio of its sessions in May because of the coronavirus pandemic, more than 130,000 listened live and  nearly two million people  have since heard the recordings. Usually, only 50 of about 450 courtroom seats are reserved for the public , scarcity that fuels a cottage industry of paid line-waiters camping on sidewalks ahead of big cases, angling for “ the legal version of Willy Wonka’s golden ticket .” Although recordings are released days after arguments, judicial transparency advocates have long demanded more real-time access, and they are likely to protest if livestreaming ends once pandemic restrictions are lifted. • “It’s going to be very hard to get the genie back in the bottle,” predicts Gabe Roth, the executive director of Fix the Court, a nonpartisan advocacy group. Even if live audio is   here to stay, it won’t necessarily change how law firms work , says Timothy Bishop, a partner at Mayer Brown who argues cases at the court. Lawyers tend to travel to hearings with small teams anyway, and clients want to be present. “Seeing the justices’ facial expressions and interaction with each other tells you a lot,” he says. More transparency has no significant downsides , Mr. Bishop says, and one important benefit is that it reveals the glory of the court. Though live audio could lead to more media coverage of mistakes or exchanges taken out of context, he says, “the court is a great institution that handles argument well, and it will be good if more people tune in to hear it in action.” • The sessions begin on Oct. 5, and DealBook readers should take note of  a consequential copyright showdown  between Oracle and Google slated for Oct. 7.

,https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-twitter-echo-chamber-confirmation-bias/,2020-09-17 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.wired.com,,"Published on 2020-09-17 13:00:00+00:00.  Many people love  social media because their feeds are a safe space to share pictures of celebrities who #stayhome wearing masks, discuss the Black Lives Matter protests, and strategize to solve climate change. And many people love social media because their feeds are a safe pace to share pictures of celebrities #tricked into wearing masks, discuss the Black Lives Matter rioters, and strategize to stop the climate change hoax. It’s a tale of two feeds, because thanks to confirmation bias and powerful proprietary algorithms, social media platforms ensure we only get a single side of every story. Even though most Americans continue to describe themselves as holding balanced views, we still naturally gravitate toward certain content online. Over time, algorithms turn slight preferences into a polarized environment in which only the loudest voices and most extreme opinions on either side can break through the noise. What Is Confirmation Bias? Confirmation bias is the natural human tendency to seek, interpret, and remember new information in accordance with preexisting beliefs. Consider it our brains’ default setting. Just by going through life, humans discover all sorts of information through focused research, general experience, and wild hunches—and it feels especially good to our brains when what we learn matches what we already expected. Also called “myside bias,” confirmation bias is an innate, universal trait that shows up across cultures. It’s a part of all of us, although once we acknowledge its presence we can take steps to diminish the hold it has on our thinking. The scientific method, legal system, and judicial process are all inventions humans created to get around our tendency to jump to conclusions (even if those same systems are sometimes subject to it). Now that confirmation bias has become so prevalent on social media, we need additional tools to manage its impact. How Does Confirmation Bias Manifest on Social Media? Science journalist David McRaney, host of the  You Are Not So Smart  podcast, believes confirmation bias is the root of why we’re drawn to social media. “The fact that social media platforms confirm what we already believe is the reason many people use them in the first place,” he says. “If the platforms didn’t do that, they wouldn’t be successful.” For the biggest brands in social media—think Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter—success is defined by the hours users spend engaged with content, and measured in advertising dollars our attention generates. Social media companies therefore rely on adaptive algorithms to assess our interests and flood us with information that will keep us scrolling. The algorithms ignore the recency and frequency of what our friends are posting and instead focus on what we “like,” “retweet,” and “share” to keep feeding content that is similar to what we’ve indicated makes us comfortable. Social media has removed traditional gatekeepers to information who evaluated stories for newsworthiness and accuracy, and while this has been a boon for the discovery of niche online groups who appreciate the same things you do, it also creates echo chambers in which a user is never presented with alternative perspectives. Why Should We Care? According to Kristina Lerman, a USC professor whose research focuses on the structure of modern social networks, echo chambers strengthen polarization and the divisions in our society. It’s common to feel uneasy because of the disassociation between the warm blanket of a like-minded social media community and the cold reality of a real-world populated with challenging perspectives. Still, it’s possible to find a balance. Jess Davis, a digital marketer who founded the brand Folk Rebellion, specializes in the responsible use of technology. “If the companies and algorithms aren’t doing it for us,” she says, “it’s up to us to regulate ourselves.” Davis, who formerly managed the social media portfolios for several well-known brands, noticed how most of the discussion around algorithms came from marketers who wanted to harness their power to increase sales.  She rejected the premise of attention as a product to be sold and has attempted to reclaim social media for a more personal purpose: the making and maintaining of connections that compliment life offline. Of course there are trolls online who actively peddle disinformation to incite hatred and violence, but usually it’s possible to separate them from regular users who just happen to have a different perspective. Davis has found satisfaction ignoring the aggressors and using the rest of her social media network as a launching point for in-person relationships. “It feels more fulfilling to have a conversation over coffee with someone you disagree with than to than reply to a thread alone and angry at home,” she says. What We Can Do About It McRaney encourages listeners to seek disconfirmation, a term for information that actively contradicts preconceived opinions. But ever the realist, he also describes this important effort as one of the hardest things for a human brain to do. “Brains seek confirmation as a knee-jerk reaction even after we’ve just formed an idea,” he points out, “And then will defend instant conclusions with the same fervor as long-held religious beliefs. It’s frustrating, but these are the brains we have.” So it’s up to us to construct an online environment that encourages our lazy brains to burst the confirmation bias bubble and consider all available angles. Here are five steps we can take today to fight back against the algorithms and reclaim our social media feeds. 1. “Like” everything.  Algorithms can’t categorize you if they can’t determine what you really like. Be generous with your thumbs ups and hearts and you’ll be rewarded with something beyond grateful friends who are glad you noticed their posts: a continued churn of content from confused platforms who must show you everything as they assess and reevaluate your preferences. 2. Actively cultivate prestige media on all sides.  Step one is about baby pictures and vacation brags. Step two is about avoiding fake news. Swallow your pre-conceived opinions and follow prestige publications across the political spectrum. A profile searching for  The National Review  and  The New Yorker  means you’ll keep your newsfeed clear of the most polarizing stories pushed by trolls on both the right and left who are out to influence and incite anger rather than inform. 3. Pay attention to the amount of followers the people you follow have.  Lerman’s research revealed that individuals who have a great disparity between their amount of followers and the number of people they themselves follow often acquire outsized influence on social media. Be cognizant of friends who post frequently but follow few others, and consider muting their accounts if they appear to engage with only like-minded thinkers. 4. Change feeds to focus on recency rather than personalization.  Both Facebook and Twitter allow users to view the most recent posts first, but the setting is difficult to find and often reverts without warning to the default view, which highlights how much the platforms want you to rely on their algorithms. Changing this setting is worth the effort. Some users will immediately see posts from accounts that have been hidden for years. 5. Create space for new voices.  Chances are you aren’t coming to the confirmation bias conversation with a clean slate, so to really start to see changes in your feed you may need to actively undo old habits to enable different voices to appear. Consider temporarily muting celebrities whose accounts share your perspectives to make room for the rest of your efforts to break through. But Is This All Worth It? There’s no question it’s a lot harder to fight confirmation bias than to just open your apps and let their algorithms control what you see. But in addition to the personal sense of calm a decreased dependence on confirmation bias creates, Lerman’s research also demonstrated that “balanced” feeds cause a positive effect that cascades through social media. In essence, posts from a balanced account will be shown more frequently and to a wider array of individuals across all algorithmic spectrums while the platforms attempt to categorize you. So try out the above steps to keep the platforms wondering what you really think. The ripple effect will keep confirmation bias away, and help build an environment that makes it possible for others to achieve the same result.
