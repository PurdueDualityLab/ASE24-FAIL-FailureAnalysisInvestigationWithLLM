309.0,https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-shut-down-malware-that-hijacked-accounts-to-run-ads/,2020-10-01 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.wired.com,,"Published on 2020-10-01 19:36:49.653000+00:00.  Usually when you  hear about malicious activity on Facebook it's tied up in  geopolitical skulduggery  of some sort. But on Thursday the company detailed a campaign out of China that wasn't focused on disinformation or stealing account data. The hackers instead stole user credentials and gained access to their accounts toward a different goal: hawking diet pills, sexual health products, and fake designer handbags, shoes, and sunglasses. Once inside a compromised Facebook user's account, the attackers would use the associated payment method to purchase malicious ads, ultimately draining $4 million from victims during their spree. Facebook first detected the attacks in late 2018, and after extensive investigation the company  filed a civil suit  against a firm, ILikeAd Media International Company Ltd., and two Chinese nationals that allegedly developed the malware and ran the attacks. Today at the digital Virus Bulletin security conference, Facebook researchers presented a detailed picture of how the malware, dubbed SilentFade, actually works and some of its novel methods, including proactively blocking a user's notifications so the victim wouldn't be aware that anything was amiss. ""We first discovered SilentFade in December 2018 when a suspicious traffic spike across a number of Facebook end points indicated a possible malware-based account compromise attack for ad fraud,"" Facebook malware researcher Sanchit Karve said on a call with reporters ahead of his Virus Bulletin presentation. ""SilentFade would steal Facebook credentials and cookies from various browser credential stores. Accounts that had access to a linked payment method would then be used to run ads on Facebook."" The attackers couldn't access actual credit card numbers or payment account details from Facebook, but once inside an account they could use whatever payment method Facebook had on file, if any, to buy ads. Facebook later reimbursed an unspecified number of users for the $4 million in fraudulent ad charges. SilentFade was often distributed by bundling it in with pirated copies of name-brand software; when a victim downloaded the program they wanted, their device would also be infected with SilentFade. From there the malware would look for special Facebook cookies in Chrome, Firefox, and other popular browsers. These cookies were valuable to the attackers, because they contain ""session tokens"" that are generated after a user logs in with their username, password, and any required two-factor authentication inputs. If you can grab a session token, you get an easy way to waltz into someone's Facebook account without needing anything else. If the malware couldn't find the right cookies, it would directly collect a user's Facebook login credentials, but would still need to decrypt them. The attackers would even set up their systems to appear to be in the same general region that the victim was in when they generated their session token. This way Facebook would think the activity was just a normal login from the user going about their day and not suspicious activity from a different region. SilentFade had other sneaky tactics too. It proactively turned off Facebook notifications on a victim's account so they wouldn't be warned about a new login or see alerts or messages about ad campaigns being run from their accounts. And it even exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's validation mechanisms to make it impossible for users to turn their ""Login Alerts"" and ""Facebook Business pages"" notifications back on. Facebook says it worked quickly to patch the bug and stop this novel persistence method. In addition to all of these tricks, the attackers also used obfuscation techniques on the ad network side to mask the true content of their ads by submitting different materials and source websites for review than what they later slotted into the ads that ran. Here's the Malware You Should Actually Worry About By  Lily Hay Newman ""They used a variety of cloaking mechanisms and traffic redirection to hide their traces,"" said Rob Leathern, Facebook's director of product management. ""These cloaking techniques are ones that camouflage the true intended landing page website by dynamically changing them during and after the ad review process so they show different sites to users than they do to our ad review process. The content of the ads often featured celebrities as a tactic to garner attention. Internally this is something we call 'celeb-bait,' and it’s an issue that has dogged the online ad industry for well over a decade."" Facebook has teams that work to catch these bait-and-switch ad operations, but Leathern says it's challenging to do so in an automated way. The SilentFade attackers also had the particular advantage of running their ads from innocent accounts that likely did not have a negative reputation or previous suspicious activity associated with them. This made it easier for the malicious ads to run undetected. In a way it's hard to imagine that with such a clever scheme and so much account access the actors were really simply trying to sell knockoff sunglasses. Facebook can only trace the activity so far, and the researchers noted that it's not totally clear what happened to users who clicked the malicious ads. But the indicators they have support the idea that the hackers really were simply trying to monetize their scam to sell counterfeit goods. Or it's possible that the actors behind SilentFade got a commission from other vendors for helping them make sales. Facebook says that since it patched the vulnerability SilentFade was exploiting to suppress account notifications, the platform has seen a marked drop-off in the malware's use. But the company says that variants have also been used to target other large tech platforms, including Twitter and more recently Amazon. Twitter and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In mid-2018, months before Facebook first detected SilentFade, researchers from the security firm Radware  published findings  on a different Facebook credential-harvesting campaign that Facebook now says was created by the same China-based actor. Distributed through phishing emails, this other malware, dubbed Stresspaint, came bundled with a drawing application called Relieve Stress Paint that would grab Facebook users' credentials and cookies from browsers using similar techniques to those used by SilentFade. Radware found that in less than five days the attackers had infected more than 40,000 targets. Facebook says that after Radware published its findings, the actor paused its activity for a few months, but it then resumed with SilentFade, a more sophisticated evolution that included the notification-blocking features. ""When we saw the Stresspaint malware almost two and a half years ago, we didn’t see the full picture of this group, because we couldn't see them performing all of these operations,"" says Adi Raff, a product manager at Radware. ""But Facebook can see what they were doing on their platform. The group itself seems very sophisticated. It's been active for almost four years, and it's developed a number of different variations of malware with different capabilities. They did a lot in those four years."" Ad fraud is a problem on every platform, but it's rare to see this kind of sophisticated compromise happen on Facebook. Given the level of access the attackers were able to achieve and maintain, it's almost fortunate that they seemingly set their sights so low. This story has been updated to include comment from Radware. More Great WIRED Stories 📩 Want the latest on tech, science, and more?  Sign up for our newsletters !

With commutes cut,  gyms closed, and pandemic cleaning completed, you might be finding it difficult to keep up with all of your podcast downloads. Episodes for your existing subscriptions accumulate while your idle time on the internet means you discover new podcasts to try, such as shows  dedicated to Covid  or those recommended for  kids stuck at home . With  more than a million podcasts to choose from , including our own brand-new  Get WIRED podcast  and our  Gadget Lab podcast , you can use these tips to manage a flood of streams. Find New Ways to Multitask Jeremy Collins listens to podcasts for 12 hours a day. “Something’s constantly on,” says Collins, the founder of the Facebook group  Podcasts We Listen To , whose 24,000 members share suggestions about the best shows. Collins can cram so many episodes into his ears because he listens while working as a delivery driver. But he also listens during all types of activities, including mowing the lawn with big noise-canceling headphones. “The deeper you get into it, the more you start to figure out new ways to listen. You find, ‘Oh, I’m sitting on the toilet and listening to a podcast,’” he says. Driving, exercising, and cleaning are popular activities during podcasts, but heavy users incorporate episodes in many other ways: Walking the dog. Doing Sudoku or crossword puzzles. Grinding for levels in video games. Digital coloring. Cleaning out email. Knitting or sewing. Metalworking. Flying drones. Shaving or showering. Waiting in line. Most podcasts were 45 minutes or longer until two or three years ago when the industry started to trend toward podcasts of five to 15 minutes that can fill otherwise open pockets of time, says Will Pearson, chief operating officer of  iHeartPodcast Network , which has 470 active shows including  Stuff You Should Know . The shift in length allows users to listen during shorter activities that previously had been podcast-free. “They step back and think about those periods in the day that they actually have time to listen but may not have thought about it before,” says Pearson, who now listens during lunch—something he couldn’t do pre-Covid when he was often eating out for business. Involving your family is another way to extend listening. Pearson, his spouse, 14-year-old daughter, and 11-year-old son hit Play while making dinner. “Everybody is stuck at home and looking for one more thing to do,” says Pearson. “Podcasts have been one more thing we can do together.” Organize Your Listening for Efficiency In the early days of podcasts, John Gibbons would listen in a linear fashion to every episode of the shows he followed. Now Gibbons is very deliberate about selecting specific episodes by using the Up Next feature on the app  Pocket Casts , where he is CEO. “That has really freed me,” he says. “Your desire to be more organized about it will encourage you to graduate up to an app like Pocket Casts because there are these features where you can organize in a specific list.” Playlists can create the right mood for the activity accompanying your podcast, and ensure you don’t fumble for the next show while exercising or driving. Manoush Zomorodi, host of the  TED Radio Hour  and  ZigZag , uses her Pandemic Summer list during chores and daily walks. “It’s ready to go,” she says. “I know that anything that’s in my latest list has been vetted by me.” To keep your library clean, set your podcast listening app for automatic deletion after you’ve played an episode. Find the Right Apps Zomorodi uses six podcast apps to stay organized for her 15 to 20 hours of listening per week. “I’m so anal about how I do it,” she says. She favors  Overcast  for creating lists and Apple Podcasts for searching. Zomorodi uses  NPR One  to discover what her colleagues are working on and to uncover random episodes. “I can allow it to act like radio stations used to act,” she says. James Cridland, editor of the  Podnews daily newsletter , advocates using tools to increase listening time. While he uses the  Castro  app to create a listening queue, Cridland prefers Pocket Casts for syncing shows among multiple devices, such as his desktop, car, phone, and smart speakers. “It knows where you’ve gone up to and what you’ve listened to” as you move between devices, Cridland says. Apple and Android watches’ sensible controls can conveniently start and stop podcasts from your wrist, set the speed, and activate other features, notes Cridland. Collins, the super user who devotes half the day to podcasts, listens on multiple devices, including his Xbox via Spotify. Cridland also recommends the voice-boost function (sometimes labeled volume boost) available on many apps, to smooth out the volume for voices, making them easier to hear if a guest is quieter than a host. Some apps can trim silences and cut intros to make shows shorter. To skip ads, set fast-forward for 30 seconds or 15 seconds based on the duration of that show’s commercials—some apps will allow you to customize not just your feed but specific podcasts. Finally, in some apps, you can track your listening stats for a sense of accomplishment or as bragging fodder on Reddit. Get Up to Speed Ross Malaga, who teaches information technology at Montclair State University in New Jersey, listens at double speed to wade through all the episodes on his phone. Malaga will revert to normal speed when his wife or two children are in the car. “They can’t stand to listen to stuff fast,” Malaga says. “It bugs them, so I step it down, but it sounds really slow to me.” There’s no denying the results of  podfasting —listening at a speed faster than 1X. Play a show at 2X to cut the time in half, allowing you to listen to another episode or do something else entirely. But listening at 1.5X or 2X speed has drawn derision and  lament , especially from podcast hosts and producers. “Oh my God, that makes me so mad,” says Zomorodi. “We make things a certain speed so you feel a certain emotion.” Zomorodi says no one would quicken an episode of  The Office . “You can’t speed up Jim’s look when Dwight says something dumb to him. No. It has to exist in real time, which is the same as podcasts. I think people are kidding themselves,” she says. For those who want to accelerate their listening, start slow and increase the speed in 10 percent or 25 percent increments. “When that sounds normal to you, increase the speed,” advises Malaga. “You go to the fastest speed where you can still comprehend and it’s still enjoyable.” Also, choose the right app: Apple Podcasts frustrates some podfasters by offering only 1.5X or 2X ,while other apps allow listeners to increase speed by 0.1X, or 10 percent, increments. Just be aware of the limitations. Uri Hasson, a professor in neuroscience and psychology at Princeton University, says the brain adapts to the speed of the incoming words, to a point. “You cannot squeeze a one-hour talk to five minutes. No one can do it,” he says. Listening at a slightly faster speed can force the user to focus and be more attentive, says Hasson, noting 25 percent faster, or 1.25X,  is probably fine for most people. He says the acceptable speed depends on many factors: the amount of training at the higher speed, how attentive the listener is, the age of the listener (younger people can listen faster, generally), how noisy the room is, how familiar the listener is with the host’s voice, whether host is speaking in the listener’s native language, whether the host has an accent. “There are many, many parameters,” Hasson says. “So it is important to understand the limitations and benefits and context and training.” A sped-up show works well for news, tech, and business podcasts, but skip podfasting for music, which will sound strange, and for true crime, where pauses build mood and suspense. Make It a Habit Whenever Elsie Escobar starts washing dishes, she also hits the Play button. “The action immediately triggers ‘Oh, I have to go listen to a podcast,’ and part of this happens with you creating a habit around it,” says Escobar, cofounder of  She Podcasts , a group that supports and nurtures female-led podcasts. Escobar, who listens an average of five hours per day, also plays podcasts while running errands, and carefully selects headphones for public consumption. She wears wireless earbuds under her hair if she doesn’t want to look anti-social, but over-the-ear headphones if she wants to focus on her feed and be left alone. “I use them depending on how I want people to interact with me,” she says. Danielle Desir recommends designating a time of day for podcasts, especially with Covid disrupting our routines. “I think time frame is very important, especially because a lot of us have different routines now,” says Desir, founder of  WOC Podcasters , which provides space for women-of-color podcasters to share resources and network. Fans even share their habits with podcast hosts. “I’ve heard from the listeners that they associate certain activities with me, whether that’s jogging or going to the grocery store,’ says Zomorodi. Delete When Done, or at Least Pause Afterward When Desir’s two-hour commute ended due to Covid, her listening time dropped to three hours per day, and she became more intentional about the podcasts she listens to. “Now I’m like, how can this podcast help me in my life?” says Desir, who subscribes to 50 shows. “If nothing captivates me, I unsubscribe.” Zomorodi advocates leaving three minutes of silence at the end of an episode. “Take the time to think about what you just listened to in this information-overload world,” she says. “What is the point of taking in all these episodes and information if you’re not going to process it and do something with it?” Collins subscribes sparingly. “It’s painful to have to cut one,” he says. Gibbons understands the sentiment. Subscribing to a show can feel like a commitment; unsubscribing like a breakup, he says. “When I unsubscribe, I think, oh man, we broke up, and I feel bad,” says Gibbons. “I think a lot of people, whether they are consciously aware of that or not, that happens and then all the sudden they’ll have 60 podcasts that they’re subscribed to, and they’re stuck in the paradox of choice, so they end up not listening to anything.” This is why Gibbons recommends skipping episodes via filters and curated lists. “It allows you to enjoy a broad swath of podcasts but enjoy specific episodes of each one. So it’s like you’re dating instead of getting married,” he says. “But there’s also a certain point at which, when you date so much, you become sort of trampish. There’s a point where you’re like, is he a gigolo or is he charming? I want to be charming.” More Great WIRED Stories 📩 Want the latest on tech, science, and more?  Sign up for our newsletters !

SAN FRANCISCO — It’s bonanza time in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street. Snowflake, a data storage and analytics provider, kicked off a frenzied phase of technology initial public offerings on Wednesday when its stock opened at more than double its listing price and then soared in early trading, in a sign of Wall Street’s appetite for fast-growing companies. The company opened at $245 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, up from $120 set by its bankers, and then shot up to as high as $319 before closing at $254. The listing, which valued Snowflake at $70.4 billion, was the largest so far this year and the largest ever for a software maker, according to Renaissance Capital, which tracks I.P.O.s. It was also a major payday for Snowflake’s venture capital investors, who had valued the start-up at $12.4 billion just seven months ago. Snowflake is among several prominent tech companies that are expected to list their shares in the coming months as the  tech industry thrives  amid the pandemic-induced economic downturn. After a lull in I.P.O.s during the volatile early months of the coronavirus crisis this spring, new listings  roared back over the summer  and have accelerated in recent weeks, even as tech stocks hit some recent turbulence. Other companies are also rushing to get out ahead of the Nov. 3 election, which could lead to more volatility. They include Airbnb, the home rental company; DoorDash, the on-demand delivery provider; Wish, an e-commerce site; Palantir, a data analytics start-up; OpenDoor, a real estate marketplace; and Asana, a collaboration software provider. This week, the software companies Sumo Logic, American Well Corporation and Unity Software are also set to go public, along with JFrog, which listed its shares on Wednesday. Together, the debuts represent a private market value of more than $78 billion. Investors are eager to back hot I.P.O.s to juice their returns, said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital. “We’ve been on this rocket ship of returns since the drop in March,” she said. But Ms. Smith cautioned that Snowflake’s high price set it up for trouble if it did not keep growing quickly. “It’s nosebleed territory,” she said. “It can’t mess up on the growth side.” Frank Slootman, Snowflake’s chief executive, agreed. “This is just a hot deal, and we’ll have to live with the consequences of it,” he said in an interview with CNBC. The action followed weeks of mounting hype over Snowflake, which offers database software that companies use to store and analyze their reams of information. Mr. Slootman, a longtime Silicon Valley software executive who has led Snowflake since 2019, previously ran ServiceNow and Data Domain, both of which also went public. On Tuesday, Snowflake sold 28 million shares for $120 each, a sharp increase from its initial price range of $75 to $85. It raised a total of $3.4 billion in its offering, which was led by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The company’s revenue has been growing quickly, jumping 133 percent in the first six months of the year to $242 million, up from $104 million during the same period last year. But it is also unprofitable, losing $171 million in the first half of this year. In its offering prospectus, Snowflake emphasized that once customers begin using its services, it often gets them to move more of their data onto its platform. Snowflake’s largest investors include Sutter Hill Ventures, which owns 20 percent of the company, as well as Altimeter Capital, Redpoint Ventures, Sequoia Capital and Iconiq Capital. Last week, Berkshire Hathaway and Salesforce Ventures each agreed to purchase $250 million of shares in Snowflake’s public offering, stoking hype around the listing. In recent years, public market investors have been skeptical of the richly valued, money-losing “unicorn” start-ups that enjoyed a decade of free-flowing venture capital. Last year, Uber’s I.P.O.  flopped  and WeWork, the co-working company,  pulled its I.P.O.  after intense scrutiny. The arrival of the coronavirus in March  further threatened  to upend the start-up industry. But the opposite has happened. Start-ups and  big technology companies  alike have  benefited  as people work and learn from home and live more of their lives online. Now start-ups are taking advantage of the  booming stock market  and investor excitement for tech. Several tech start-ups with upcoming market debuts plan to try new methods and processes for the transaction. Some, including OpenDoor, the vehicle sales site Shift Technologies and  various electric vehicle makers , are agreeing to “blank check” mergers via  special purpose acquisition companies . Such transactions offer more flexibility around deal terms and can be completed quickly. Others, like Palantir and Asana, said they would go public via direct listing, which bypasses the traditional underwriting process. With a private valuation of $20 billion,  Palantir could  be the largest company to try such a transaction, following in the  footsteps of Slack , the workplace collaboration service, and Spotify, the music streaming company. Venture capitalists have argued for this method because it does not aim for a first-day trading “pop” that indicates the company could have priced its shares higher and raised more money from the transaction. Past direct listings have also not raised new capital, but in August, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the New York Stock Exchange’s plan to let companies raise money in direct listings. The plan has been criticized by some as harmful to potential investors. Other companies may explore the Long Term Stock Exchange, a new trading platform created by Eric Ries, author of tech bible “The Lean Startup.” The exchange, which is intended to give longer-term investors more voting control, is backed by several of Silicon Valley’s top investors. It opened for business last week.",,2023-04-20 18:56:41.296254+00:00,False,,,Snowflake Stock More Than Doubles in IPO Debut - The New York Times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[33, 34, 40]",310
,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/10/parenting/family-second-language-coronavirus.html,2020-09-10 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,,"Published on 2020-09-10 00:00:00.  A few days into the lockdown here in London, I noticed a surprising side-effect of the pandemic: My 3-year-old son was speaking more German. German is my mother tongue, and I have used it with him since he was born, but because everyone around us speaks English, including my British husband, we settled into a pattern typical of mixed families. I spoke to my son in German, and he replied in English. Then Covid-19 reshuffled our linguistic deck. As all of us quarantined at home, my son embraced German with unprecedented enthusiasm. Now, almost six months on, it has become his preferred language. In a complete reversal, he even replies to my husband in German. My experience is far from unique. All over the world, Covid-19 has forced children to stay inside. In some homes where different languages coexist, this is changing how they speak. With schools and day cares closed, previously dominant languages — such as English in Britain and the United States — are no longer as overpowering. Instead, children are hearing more of their parents’ mother tongues. “They’re put into this little hothouse of less English, more other languages,” said Ludovica Serratrice, Ph.D., a professor specializing in multilingualism at the University of Reading in Britain. Together with researchers at the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, University College London and other institutions, Dr. Serratrice surveyed the language habits of over 700 multilingual families in Britain and Ireland from April to the beginning of July, when the countries were mostly shut down. And researchers in Norway carried out an adapted version of the same survey, collecting responses from almost 200 families. The parents in these families spoke more than 40 different mother tongues, including French, Polish, Spanish, Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, Kirundi and Zulu. Before the lockdown, the children tended to use the dominant languages: English in Britain and Ireland, and Norwegian in Norway (plus English, thanks to television, computer games and other media). Now, preliminary data suggests children were using the parents’ languages more during the lockdown, especially among younger kids. “When you think about living in a different country and raising your child in your native language, some people think, ‘Oh, it’s the most natural thing and it’s easy,’ because it’s your native language. And that couldn’t be further from the truth,” said Elisabet García González, a doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo who led the Norwegian survey. Instead, “the language of the home becomes less and less important,” she said, as children start school and make friends in the country’s dominant language. Unless parents take extra measures, the  ancestral sound may fade . School plays a crucial role with this; i n a study  of 200 Korean-American families, the portion of firstborn children who spoke Korean to their parents went from almost 80 percent to 34 percent after starting school. Younger siblings spoke even less. For parents, that sudden rejection of the mother tongue can be bewildering and even painful. My son’s first words were in German. He preferred it as long as I was on maternity leave and we were both at home. When he started day care, he switched to English, even in our own conversations, and it was as if someone had snatched away our common language. The pandemic appears to have stopped that slide, at least for some. Dr. Elizabeth Lanza, a professor of linguistics at the University of Oslo, who supervised the Norwegian survey, observed the shift in her own family. Lanza is American, but has lived in Norway for decades. Her daughter also lives in Norway and speaks English to her young toddler, while her partner speaks Norwegian. Before Covid-19, one of the boy’s favorite words was the Norwegian  “mer!”,  echoing the language he heard at his day care .  About a week into the lockdown, he switched to the English equivalent:  “more!” Dr. Lanza cautioned that not all respondents saw their native tongue strengthen. Some even said it was suffering because they were home-schooling the children in Norwegian. But where the languages did blossom, it made the parents happy. In the midst of an incredibly  stressful time , the fact that the children were speaking these second languages brought parents joy. This echoes  research  suggesting that passing on one’s language can create better communication between generations and a shared identity and heritage. In the United States, researchers interested in language have launched  an app called KidTalk  to gather recordings made before and during Covid-19. Yi Ting Huang, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Hearing and Speech Sciences at the University of Maryland, and Joshua Hartshorne, Ph.D., an assistant professor of psychology at Boston College, have recruited more than 300 families, about a third of which are multilingual, for the project. Dr. Hartshorne said it’s a good opportunity to study how children learn languages, including multiple languages. “I don’t know that we’ve had recent historical precedent for a child’s world to be shrunk down to just the immediate family for months at a time,” he wrote in an email. Dr. Huang plans to use speech-recognition software to analyze the recordings; for example, identifying the number of speakers and languages in each conversation, and tracking any changes. This could help us understand how multilingual children deploy their different languages as learning tools, such as using their knowledge of one to acquire the next. In the past, Dr. Huang said, many researchers and policymakers viewed a child as a water glass that could only hold so much liquid. “So we’re just trying to cram as much of one language as opposed to another language,” she said. This led to some parents and teachers using only English with children, and suppressing second languages. Now most experts say children use languages flexibly, changing them for the situation. Dr. Huang experienced this herself. When she was 5 years old, she moved to the United States from Taiwan, where she’d spoken Mandarin to her mother. But in the U.S., she began replying in English. It was only as an adult that she realized how much Mandarin meant to her. Now she uses it again with her mother. “I find a lot of comfort in Mandarin,” she said. “It reminds me of my mom and home.” In an email, she described language as a “living marker of history and cultural identity,” linking immigrant families to their place of origin. Dr. Huang said that my son’s radical switch to German might be similar. Amid the upheaval of Covid-19, he might be turning to a reassuring language that he associates with me: “We’re all reaching for some things that feel familiar.” Earlier this year, Dr. Huang’s mother joined her to help with child care, and within only a week or so, Huang noticed her 6-year-old daughter engaging more with Mandarin. Dr. Hartshorne and his partner are also raising their daughter in English and Mandarin, but they have seen the opposite effect. “Initially, we were full of energy and actually speaking more Mandarin to our daughter, and her Mandarin actually started to improve relative to her English,” he wrote. “As the weeks have worn on, we’ve worn down.” English has become the family’s default language, though the daughter still understands Mandarin. For some parents, the school closures are an opportunity to challenge bigger linguistic hierarchies. Medadi Ssentanda, Ph.D., is a lecturer in African languages at Makerere University in Uganda, and a specialist in mother tongue education. More than 42 Indigenous languages are spoken in Uganda, but formal education is delivered in English, a legacy of colonialism. Dr. Ssentanda has observed that the local language — Luganda — in his own neighborhood has gained strength during lockdown. Children are spending more time with their families, and are also seeing the language used in ways they hadn’t considered before. When his 12-year-old daughter asked him to judge a debate with other children in English, Dr. Ssentanda agreed — but only if they held it in Luganda. “She was surprised!” he wrote in an email. “There is a belief that academic issues must necessarily be discussed in the English language.” Will all these languages continue to blossom after Covid-19? It’s hard to say. Some researchers expected children to revert to the dominant language once life returns to normal. Others saw the possibility of a virtuous cycle, with children growing more confident in their second language and using it more in the long run. In the meantime, I’ve decided to simply enjoy my son’s new love of German. Perhaps it will continue as our shared language this time. But even if it doesn’t, I’ll always remember that when the whole world was in turmoil, my mother tongue was there to provide warmth, laughter and a feeling of safety.

Facebook’s artificial intelligence  researchers have a plan to make  algorithms  smarter by exposing them to human cunning. They want your help to supply the trickery. On Thursday,  Facebook ’s AI lab launched a project called  Dynabench  that creates a kind of gladiatorial arena in which humans try to trip up AI systems. Challenges include crafting sentences that cause a sentiment-scoring system to misfire, reading a comment as negative when it is actually positive, for example. Another involves tricking a hate-speech filter—a potential draw for teens and trolls. The project initially focuses on text-processing software, although it could later be extended to other areas such as speech, images, or interactive games. Subjecting AI to provocations from people is intended to give a truer measure of the intelligence (and stupidity) of  artificial intelligence , and provide data that can improve it. Researchers typically compare algorithms by scoring how accurately they label images or answer multiple choice questions on standard collections of data, known as benchmarks. Facebook researcher Douwe Kiela says those tests don’t really measure what he and others in the field care about. “The thing we’re really interested in is how often it makes mistakes when it interacts with a person,” he says. “With current benchmarks it looks like we’re amazing at doing language in AI, and that’s very misleading, because we still have a lot to do.” The researchers hope analyzing cases where AI was snookered by people will make algorithms less dupable. Kiela hopes AI experts and ordinary netizens alike will find it fun to log on to spar with AI and earn virtual badges, but the platform will also let researchers pay for contributions through Amazon’s crowdsourcing service Mechanical Turk. AI labs at Stanford, University of North Carolina, and University College London will all maintain artificial intelligence tests on the Dynabench platform. “The thing we’re really interested in is how often it makes mistakes when it interacts with a person.” Douwe Kiela, Facebook researcher Facebook’s project comes as more AI researchers, including the  social network’s VP of artificial intelligence , say the field needs to  broaden its horizons  if computers are to become capable of handling complex, real-world situations. In the past eight years, breakthroughs in an AI technique called  deep learning  have brought consumers speech recognition that mostly works, phones that auto-sort dog photos, and some hilarious Snapchat filters. Algorithms can unspool  eerily limpid text . Yet deep learning software stumbles in situations outside its narrow training. The best text-processing algorithms can still be tripped up by the  nuances of language , such as sarcasm, or how cultural context can shift the meaning of words. Those are major challenges for Facebook’s  hate-speech   detectors . Text generators often spew nonsensical sentences  adrift from reality . Those limitations can be hard to see if you look at the standard benchmarks used in AI research. Some tests of AI reading comprehension have had to be redesigned and made more challenging in recent years because algorithms figured out how to score so highly,  even surpassing humans . The WIRED Guide to Artificial Intelligence Supersmart algorithms won't take all the jobs, But they are learning faster than ever, doing everything from medical diagnostics to serving up ads. By  Tom Simonite Yejin Choi, a professor at the University of Washington and research manager at the Allen Institute for AI, says such results are deceptive. The statistical might of machine-learning algorithms can discover tiny correlations in test data sets, undetectable by people, that reveal correct answers without requiring a human’s wider understanding of the world. “We are seeing a  Clever Hans  situation,” she says, referring to the horse who faked numeracy by reading human body language. More AI researchers are now seeking alternate ways to  measure and spur progress . Choi has tested some of her own, including one that  scores text-generation algorithms  by how well their responses to Reddit posts rank against those from people. Other researchers have  experimented  with having humans try to  trick text algorithms , showing how examples collected this way can make AI systems improve. Algorithms tend to look less smart when pitted against those more challenging tests, and Choi expects to see a similar pattern on Facebook’s new Dynabench platform. Projects that strip away AI emperors’ clothes could jolt researchers into exploring fresher ideas that lead to breakthroughs. “It will challenge the community to think harder about how learning should really take place with AI,” Choi says. “We need to be more creative.” More Great WIRED Stories 📩 Want the latest on tech, science, and more?
