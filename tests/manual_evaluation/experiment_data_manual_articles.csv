1183,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-fraud-trial-new-york-10-03-23/index.html,2023-10-03 12:34:54+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,,"Published on 2023-10-03 12:33:40+00:00. Trump speaks to the media before entering the courtroom on Tuesday, October 3. Seth Wenig/AP

Before former President Donald Trump appeared in court Tuesday for the second day of his civil fraud trial in New York, he claimed on social media that it has now “been agreed in Court that Mar-a-Lago is WORTH 50 to 100 times the Value” New York Attorney General Letitia James had ascribed to it, $18 million.

Trump was claiming, therefore, that the court had agreed the Florida property is worth $900 million to $1.8 billion.

Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. There has been no such agreement in court. Judge Arthur Engoron and a lawyer for James’ office did not endorse a Trump lawyer’s Monday claim in court that Mar-a-Lago could be sold for more than $1 billion.

In Engoron’s decision last week finding Trump liable for fraud, he wrote that “from 2011-2021, the Palm Beach County Assessor appraised the market value of Mar-a-Lago at between $18 million and $27.6 million.”

He also noted that there are significant land use restrictions attached to the property, and he wrote that Trump’s financial statements, valuing Mar-a-Lago at roughly $426.5 million to $612.1 million between 2011 and 2021, are “materially false and misleading” because they don’t reflect those restrictions.

Trump lawyer Alina Habba sharply disputed this conclusion in court on Monday, saying that “we have experts, renowned experts, who have said that properties like Mar-a-Lago are worth over a billion dollars, $1.5 billion, and I assure you that there is a person out there that would buy that property, that spectacular property, for way over a billion dollars.""

Trump and his team are entitled to argue that the judge’s analysis is inaccurate. But Trump himself was wrong to suggest that the judge had agreed in court that Mar-a-Lago is worth even more than his financial statements claimed. The judge did nothing of the sort.

Engoron noted again in court on Monday that there were “significant” limitations on how the property can be used, and he said he had “specifically said” in the decision last week that “I'm not valuing or evaluating properties.”

He said, “Please, press, stop saying that I valued it at $18 million. That was a tax assessment. Or, something in that range. There would have been issues of fact as to what the value was.”",,2023-10-13 19:51:58.964841+00:00,True,False,,,,"October 3, 2023 - Trump civil fraud trial continues in New York - CNN",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At first what seemed like an embarrassing network outage that kept customers from accessing PlayStation Network, Sony's online game play and streaming video service, turned out to be much worse: a sophisticated cyberattack made off with the customer data of 77 million PSN and Qriocity customers.

Sony wasn't very forthcoming with information at first--it was a couple days before it acknowledged why PSN was offline, and two days after that it confirmed the security breach. Then over the weekend, the No. 2 guy at Sony, Kazuo Hirai, took the stage at a hastily organized press conference in Tokyo to try to explain what led to the attack, what exactly was stolen in the intrusion on its network, and how Sony plans to compensate its customers.

And then just when it seemed Sony was on its way to start recovering from the debacle, more bad news hit: Sony said yesterday the same breach that compromised PSN and Qriocity customer information extends to Sony Online Entertainment customers too. Information about subscribers to the multiplayer online game service--names, addresses, e-mail, genders, birthdates, phone numbers, usernames, and passwords--was exposed, as was an ""outdated"" database of credit cards from 12,700 non-U.S. customers as part of the same intrusion on its network two weeks ago, Sony said in a statement.

Is the news about SOE where this story ends? Sony swears that its main credit card database wasn't compromised since it's separate from servers running PSN, Qriocity, and SOE. But the company's investigation into the breach continues, and it's possible there's still more to come.

In the meantime, we've pulled together all the available information about the attack and its fallout from the last two weeks and put it here. We'll update this FAQ as we find out more.

When will PlayStation Network and Qriocity be back online?

We don't know an exact day, but on Saturday night Sony said most PSN and Qriocity services will be available again ""this week."" On Tuesday, when it announced the breach, the company said services would be restored ""within the week,"" which suggested Tuesday this week at the latest.

But even when Sony does flip the switch, not all services will be restored right away.

What will be available first: online game play for PS3 and PSP, watching downloaded movies and other unexpired rental content, Music Unlimited by Qriocity, friends lists, chat functionality, and PlayStation Home.

Most importantly, customers will finally be able to reset their password and manage their accounts.

How did the attack against PSN go down?

Between April 17 and 19, a so-far unnamed person illegally gained access to Sony's PSN servers in San Diego, Calif., by hacking into an application server behind a Web server and two firewalls. According to Sony Chief Information Officer Shinji Hajesima, the attack was disguised as a purchase, so it did not immediately raise any red flags. The vulnerability the attacker was able to exploit was known, according to Sony.

Sony flagged the attack on April 19 and on April 20 shut down PSN as well as Qriocity. The company hired security experts and contacted the FBI to investigate the exploit and find out what took place. Sony says it didn't actually learn for certain that personal information was exposed until April 25.

Sony described the attack as ""very sophisticated"" and still does not know the intruder's identity.

Did Sony really not encrypt passwords?

While credit card data was encrypted, Sony admitted that customer names, birthdates, addresses, user names, and passwords were not. But neither did it store them in cleartext, the company said today. Cleartext refers to storing information in a way that's readable to humans without any processing.

""While the passwords that were stored were not 'encrypted,' they were transformed using a cryptographic hash function. There is a difference between these two types of security measures which is why we said the passwords had not been encrypted,"" wrote Sony spokesman Patrick Seybold today. ""But I want to be very clear that the passwords were not stored in our database in cleartext form.""

Is there any evidence anyone's been the victim of identity theft or credit card fraud as a result?

Sony says so far they have not seen any evidence to suggest that. Last week, it was rumored that a group of hackers was selling a database of customer information and credit card data said to be from PSN and had attempted to sell it back to Sony. Company spokesman Seybold has repeatedly denied this.

There were 77 million customers with profiles set up on PSN that included their names, birthdate, and address, but only 10 million of them had uploaded their credit card information for purchasing and renting content, according to Sony.

What is Sony doing to make sure this type of breach doesn't happen again?

First, Sony Computer Entertainment is creating a new position, chief security information officer. SCE is the business division responsible for gaming at Sony. Whoever occupies the post will report to Hasejima, chief information officer of Sony.

Sony was already planning to move its PSN servers from San Diego to another unnamed location. As a result of the attack, Sony is speeding up that move.

Sony says it is upgrading PSN server system security, including adding automated software monitoring and configuration management, enhancing data encryption, and implementing more firewalls, Hirai said this weekend.

Sony keeps apologizing, but how will it make it up to me as a customer?

Sony says it will help customers enroll in free identity theft monitoring, something that will be handled differently depending on the region. There so far is not a lot of detail regarding how this will work, but a Sony spokesperson says more information will be forthcoming.

The company has also instituted a ""Welcome Back"" program to encourage its customers to return to using PSN. It will vary in different regions, but the basics are this: Sony will offer free downloads of ""entertainment content,"" current PSN customers will get free PlayStation Plus (a paid premium service) for 30 days, current PS Plus customers who've already paid for a monthly or yearly membership will also get 30 days free (we still don't know how Sony plans to implement this--a refund? Or just an extra 30 days free?), and current Music Unlimited by Qriocitysubscribers get 30 days of free service.

The company hasn't yet said how it will compensate SOE customers.",,2023-10-17 06:14:09.080456+00:00,True,True,False,,,The PlayStation Network breach (FAQ) - CNET,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As I mentioned in my post on ""do not track"" options, a key source of revenue for Web services of all types is the sale of the Web activities of their users. Data about when people use their services and how they use them are recorded and anonymized (we hope).

Then ad networks serve people ads based on their Web habits. Unfortunately, the sites themselves don't always follow their own data-collection policies.

For example, Facebook was recording users' Web histories even after they had signed out of their Facebook account. The Electronic Frontier Foundation describes the glitch that caused the inadvertent data collection and Facebook's response, which pointed the finger at a defect in Facebook's cookie-management system--since corrected, we're assured.

Ghostery icon shows the number of trackers on the current page

After hearing about Facebook's overzealous tracking, I decided to take a two-week break from Facebook, just to see if I could stay off the company's radar screen for that long. I started by deleting all the cookies in Firefox and Google Chrome, the two browsers I use most often. I then restarted both programs with an empty cookie folder.

As the EFF post indicates, you can pick up a Facebook cookie by opening one of the sites the service partners with. Using Ghostery, I was able to block Facebook Connect and other Facebook cookies.

After you install Ghostery, click the ghost icon in the top-right corner and choose Options (the Options icon in Chrome). Scroll to Blocking Options, check ""Enable bug blocking (experimental),"" and check the tracking sites you wish to block.

The Ghostery icon shows the number of trackers on the current page--if no number is shown, no trackers were detected. Click the icon to display the trackers and links to more information. In Firefox, they're listed on a fly-out menu. In Chrome, the information is presented in a scrollable list.

Ghostery's options let you relocate the ""alert bubble"" that appears when the page opens. The bubble lists the trackers the program has detected and then fades away after a few seconds.

You can manually enter the sites you don't want to prevent from tracking. The last Ghostery option lets you set the add-on's ""bug"" list to auto-update.

The GhostRank sharing feature is disabled by default. Enable it to send anonymous information to Ghostery's developer about the bugs you encounter as you browse. The information becomes part of the developer's ""census of Web bugs across the Internet.""

Knowing who's keeping tabs on your Web activities is the first step toward managing the personal information you share with Web services. Being able to block the services you distrust isn't a guarantee your personal information won't fall into the wrong hands, but at least Ghostery provides Web users with a modicum of control over their private data.",,2023-10-17 11:51:06.218523+00:00,True,False,,,,How to know who is tracking your Web activities - CNET,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While it's not the flagship tough camera in the Olympus range — that's left to the TG-820 — the TG-320 is still designed to withstand the elements. The TG-320 is cased in a plastic exterior, which is rigid enough to survive some rough treatment, so it comes as some surprise to feel that the camera only weighs in at 155 grams.

The Good Lightweight. Well priced. Screen easy to see underwater. The Bad Poor video quality. Some water passed the double-locking door. The Bottom Line The TG-320 is a tough camera that takes decent photos for sharing online. What's most concerning is that it leaked slightly when used underwater.

Painted in a bright blue or red finish, the TG-310 is easy to see in all conditions, and it comes with a wrist strap in the box. The camera's rugged credentials read like so: waterproof to 3 metres, drop proof from 1.5 metres and freeze proof to -10 degrees Celsius. Elsewhere, the figures are a little less interesting, with a 3.6x optical zoom opening up to 28mm at its widest. The lens has a maximum aperture range of f/3.5-5.1. There's a 2.7-inch LCD screen at the rear, sporting a relatively low resolution of 230,000 dots.

It comes with a double-locking door to protect the SDXC card slot, battery and mini HDMI from being water damaged, although the rubber seal is rather small, compared to those we've seen on other rugged cameras.

On the topic of rubber, the rear buttons are coated in a rubber-like plastic, with a small instant-on recording button, a four-way directional pad and a zoom rocker all bedecked in this outfit. There's a small speaker also located at the back.

Along with the regular intelligent automatic mode, the camera comes with a range of scene modes, panorama mode, 3D mode and program auto-recording. The TG-310 also has magic filters, which is the Olympus terminology (in its compact range at least) for artistic filters, such as pop art, fish eye and soft focus. There are eight magic filters all up, and, rather confusingly, the camera limits the output resolution to 5 megapixels when shooting with them.

Anyone wanting to create underwater cinematic masterpieces will be a tad disappointed, with only 720p HD video recording on board. The TG-320 comes with in-camera battery charging, through a particularly long cord that is constructed from the proprietary USB cable, the power adapter and the power cord.

The TG-320 has a high-speed sequential-shooting mode that reduces the resolution to 3 megapixels and takes 3.5 frames per second. Note that the performance comparison is against two older models (Panasonic, Sony) rather than the newer models in the comparison table above. We'll update this review once we've tested the newer models.

Image quality

The TG-320 delivers images that are fine for a camera of this class, particularly for sharing online at reduced resolutions. Photos at 100 per cent magnification look over-processed and slightly crunchy, a trait that we have seen on other tough cameras before. When shooting in automatic mode, colours are slightly muted and not as saturated as they could be. There are, of course, artistic filters to augment the colours, should you desire. The TG-320 is at its best when underwater, as it delivers punchy blue tones. The screen is also relatively easy to see underwater.

As the lens is mostly exposed to the elements, it is easy to smudge it, resulting in smeary-looking photos. Even when the lens is clean, it exhibits some lens flare and halation on images.

The built-in panorama mode works a little differently to other cameras that you might be used to with this feature. You first need to press the shutter and hold it while you move the camera along an axis, matching up the level indicator with the level from the previous shot. The resulting panorama looks fine at low resolution (as you can see below), but when enlarged looks rather soft.

Rather worryingly, though, the TG-320 might not be as water tight as we are led to believe. More than six hours after dunking the camera about 30cm into water to test its credentials, we opened the double-locking door to remove the memory card and found some water lurking inside. It wasn't enough to cause any damage, but the rubber seal itself was still wet and water had dripped down the side near the card slot.

Video quality is patchy at best. The image does not appear clear, and not having a wind-cut feature available means that there's plenty of wind noise to be heard.

16334,https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/why-ultra-hd-4k-tvs-are-still-stupid/,2021-07-08 23:17:44+00:00,https://www.cnet.com,,"Published on None. As we all expected, the big news at CES this year was Ultra HD 4K displays. It seemed that every TV manufacturer had one, ranging from massive LED LCDs to midsize LED LCDs to midsize OLEDs.

We've talked about this before, but now with more info, and definitive product announcements, let me explain in exacting, excruciating detail why 4K TVs are still stupid.

Allow me to start with the most important point:

1. I love 4K

It is my fault for trying to make a nuanced argument on the Internet. I have a 102-inch ""TV"" and sit 9 feet from it. I would love to have 4K. When I expand out to fill the full 10-foot-wide 2.35:1 screen, I can see pixels with some projectors. I look forward to more 4K projectors. Projectors are not TVs; 4K TVs are a waste. This is because...

2. The eye has a finite resolution

This is basic biology. The accepted ""normal"" vision is 20/20. In response to my previous articles on the stupidity of 4K TVs, many people argued they had better vision, or some other number should be used. This is like arguing doors should be bigger because there are tall people. Also, just because you have better vision, doesn't mean most people have better vision. If they did, it wouldn't be better, it would be average.

Try this. Go to the beach (or a big sandbox, or a baseball diamond). Sit down. Start counting how many grains of sand you can see next to you. Now do the same with the grains of sand by your feet. Try again with the sand far beyond your feet (like, say, 10 feet away). The fact that you can see individual grains near you, but not farther away is exactly what we're talking about here. The eye is analog. Randomly analog at that. So of course some people are going to see more detail than others, and at different distances, but 20/20 is what everyone knows, and it is by far the most logical place to start any discussion.

Is there some wiggle room thanks to variances in how people see? Yes, of course. Here's an awesome chart:

Let's skip ahead a step. Getting bogged down in the specifics misses the big picture. The eye does have a finite resolution, and if you want to argue it's better than 20/20, you're still conceding the point. You're just saying that smaller 4K TVs are viable. How much smaller? Well, not 50 inches. Probably not 60 inches, either. These are the sizes people are buying. Most people are buying even smaller TVs. Which leads to...

3. 84-inch TVs are never going to be mainstream

Never. Ever. Never ever. Like I said earlier, I have a 102-inch screen. I've also reviewed an 80-inch Sharp LCD. And let me tell you, it dominates the room. It's massive. There is a significant difference between a screen (effectively, the wall), and a Device of Unusual Size. Enthusiasts might be OK with this thing in their room, but most people won't. Ask your spouse. Ask your spouse's friends. Screen sizes have been inching upward, but not linearly with price. More specifically, the prices of big-big screens have fallen much faster than their sales have increased. I don't know what the upper limit is for what the average consumer decides is ""too big"" for their room, but I'm positive there is an upper limit, and this limit is far smaller than screens that need 4K.

I should clarify what I mean by ""TV."" I'm specifically talking about the televisions we know today. When OLED becomes something you can paint on your wall, or so paper-thin it hangs like a poster, then absolutely people will get bigger screens (presuming they're cheap). However, this is years (decades?) away. This future awesomeness is different than TVs of today. Will we still call them ""TVs""? Yeah, probably, but their presence in the room will be radically different, hopefully because these future wafer-thin ""TVs"" won't have a presence in the room. They'll be part of the wall.

4. Viewing distance hasn't changed with HD, why would it change with UHD?

In the old days of 480i CRT tube TVs, people sat roughly 9 to 10 feet away from their TVs. There were good reasons for this (scan lines). Modern TVs offer significantly better resolution, so people can sit closer. Except...they don't. Most people still sit the same distance from their TVs as they did before.

Could people sit closer? Sure. A lot closer, actually. This ties in exactly with point No. 3. Sitting closer would be like getting a bigger screen, as it takes up more of your field of view. Just as people aren't getting as big a TV as they could, people aren't sitting closer, either.

So they can sit closer now, but don't. Why would anyone assume that because of UHD, people would suddenly sit closer. It doesn't make any sense. And just like with No. 3, I don't think most people would want to sit closer. Some of you might want to sit 5.5 feet from a 84-inch screen, but you are a tiny minority.

And speaking of viewing distance, this is precisely why comparisons to the Retina Display iPad are specious. The viewing distance is rather different between a TV and a tablet. Or, as President of DisplayMate Technologies Corp. Raymond M. Soneira says, your TV is already a Retina Display.

5. Why 4K?

Ah, now this is an interesting question. It's clear many seem to think TV manufacturers are some sort of altruistic entities that only do new things if there's a benefit to the consumer. How adorable, but no. Ultra HD isn't the ""new technology"" it appears. Modern TVs are made from huge sheets of ""motherglass."" From this big piece, companies slice up smaller pieces to make televisions. It's easier (read: cheaper) to make a big piece and cut it into smaller TVs.

Originally this was in case there was a problem with part of the glass, the rest could still be sold as TVs. When you read about ""yields"" as part of TV manufacturing, this is largely what they're talking about.

But manufacturing has gotten really good, so most of these pieces of motherglass are fully used. Instead of slicing up one piece of motherglass into four 42-inch 1080p LCDs, what if you just kept the whole thing as one piece? What would you have? You'd have an 84-inch TV. Use the exact same (or similar) drive elements/electronics and all the various bits, and you've got a 3,840x2,160-pixel, 84-inch UHD TV. Hey, wait.

You see, TV companies are pushing 4K because they can. It's easy, or at least easier than improving the more important aspects of picture quality (like contrast ratio, color accuracy, motion blur, compression artifacts, and so on).

6. 4K is easy to market

OK, so 4K is easier to manufacturer than an actual new technology ( OLED), but there's more to it than that. Ultra HD is an easy sell. It's a number, greater than another number; therefore it's ""better."" In the confusing world of televisions, simplifying ""superiority"" down to a single number is marketing gold.

This is just like megapixels on a camera. An 18-megapixel camera does not necessarily take better pictures than a 16-megapixel camera. I guarantee my SLR takes better pictures than a ""higher-resolution"" point-and-shoot. Numbers are easy to understand, and for nonenthusiasts, distilling a TV down to a single number is desirable. This was rampant in the early days of 1080p. I actually heard people say ""I don't know what 1080p is, but I know I'm supposed to want it."" And looking at a spec sheet in BigBuy, 1080p is more than 720p, so it's better, right? 4K is an easy sell: it's higher than 1080p. It's also an easy demo...

7. 4K makes a great demo

Our own Matt Moskovciak tweeted this at CES:

Exactly. Take a look at the picture at the top of this post. Better yet, look at this one:

Sexy bald head aside, when people talk about seeing 4K, they are way closer than they would normally be. Up closer, yeah, 4K looks amazing. This is, of course, how they'll sell in stores. People will walk right up to the screen and go ""Wow!"" This ignores points Nos. 2 and 4, but try to explain either one to a nonenthusiast. It looks neat, it has a number greater than another (point No. 6), and I'm sure it will sell.

Eventually...

8. The lack of content is not the problem

So much coverage has focused on the lack of 4K content. This is not the issue. It was years before HDTVs had meaningful amounts of content. Presuming points No. 2, 3, and/or 4, quality upconversion can add some detail to 1080p content, making it appear a little sharper than nonupconverted 1080p on a like-size 1080p screen. Again, this is presuming you're close enough to see it. Upconverted content is not the same as real 4K content, but it's a step.

There are other, better uses for Ultra HD TVs as well. Passive 3D is far more pleasing to watch than active 3D, but you lose half the vertical resolution (i.e. 1,920x540 pixels per eye with 1080p). This is still the case with passive 4K TVs, but you can afford to lose it. Passive Ultra HD TVs are still greater than HD resolution, at 3,840x1,080 pixels per eye.

This also opens up possibilities for viewing two different programs on the same TV. Using polarized glasses that block the same lines for each eye, two different 3,840x1,080-pixel programs could be enjoyed by different people on the same couch. So the Missus could watch the game while you watch ""The Bachelor"" (presuming you have two cable boxes or an antenna). This is somewhat possible now (though this is half-HD resolution) and Samsung demoed a prototype version at CES, so this isn't strictly a 4K thing, but it is an interesting use.

9. There are bigger issues

My biggest complaint about Ultra HD is what it doesn't address. Resolution is not the most important aspect of picture quality. Nor, as we've discussed, is it even a problem with current picture quality. How about improving contrast ratio, color, and compression artifacts? These all have a significantly greater effect on picture quality than resolution.

I'll add another problem to the list of things 4K doesn't address: motion resolution. All LCDs suffer from motion resolution problems, in many cases, losing upward of 40 percent of their visible resolution when anything on the screen moves. All announced (and most of the previewed) Ultra HD displays are still just LCDs, with all of that technology's shortcomings. These so-called ""next-generation"" televisions will still have poor off-axis picture quality and mediocre contrast ratios. They'll likely have poor picture uniformity, too, as many models are edge-lit. True, they all have higher refresh rates, but without motion interpolation, higher refresh rates do little to fix motion blur. If the drop in resolution with current LCDs is any indication (and No. 5 shows it is), these ""2160p"" TVs will resolve something like 1,296 lines with motion.

Perhaps this is why nearly every demo at CES of 4K and 8K TVs showed slow pans and still images. Check out ""What is refresh rate?"" for more on motion resolution.

Will some models offer methods to combat motion resolution that don't cause the dreaded Soap Opera Effect, like black frame insertion? Many will, yes, but not all.

10. Ultra HD OLED

Sony and Panasonic previewed 4K OLED TVs at CES last year. Since OLED does address the contrast ratio issue, I have no problem with 4K OLED. When I saw LG 4K OLEDs at the CEDIA Expo, they looked amazing. This is because OLEDs create a better overall picture, regardless of their resolution.

During the CES lest year I tweeted the following:

You see, I want us all to have a new car, not just get stuck with our aging Pintos or fermenting Omni GLHs with a slapped-on set of shiny new Pirellis. (And I'll leave it up to you to decide which one of those is LCD and which is plasma.)

11. There are no standards

This is, perhaps the biggest problem with Ultra HD displays available right now/soon. HDMI 1.4, the most common standard, allows for a maximum of 4,096x2,160 pixels at 24fps. Granted this is slightly higher than the 3,840x2,160 of the current crop of Ultra HD displays, but it is not enough to do 4K 3D. It's not enough to do higher frame rates, either, which may or may not come into play (though with computers, it certainly will).

HDMI 2.0 will offer more bandwidth, so higher resolutions and frame rates can be transmitted over everyone's favorite cable, but that will require different transmitter and receiver chips. This won't be a software upgrade, many of the current Ultra HD displays are already obsolete. Remember, this isn't as simple as swapping out a new cable; the hardware in the TV won't be able to accept the higher data rates. I don't hear any manufacturer mentioning that upgrade path for their $20,000 televisions.

When there is a final standard, who knows what it might have? Maybe they will improve some aspect of color (either in better color depth or in a wider color gamut or both). These Ultra HD displays won't be able to take advantage of that, either.

12. 4K TV is inevitable

When I first starting pointing out most people didn't need 1080p TVs (in the age of 720p flat panels), I knew -- and said at the time -- that 1080p was inevitable. I was just trying to save people some money. That's all I'm trying to do here. Nothing I say will have any effect on what the corporate giants decide to force on us mortals. I'm just trying to point out that increasing resolution in itself is not the improvement in picture quality it ""appears"" on paper. I'm trying to point out that even when these TVs come out, your money is better spent elsewhere. What I want is better, cheaper TVs and better picture quality for everyone. So thank you to everyone who made personal attacks against me for pointing out what should be obvious (that your favorite TV company is not your boyfriend).

Update: November 13, 2014

13. Nooooope

Since I wrote this article nearly two years ago, there are vastly more 4K TV available. There's also a lot more marketing money hyping 4K. But the facts haven't changed, and what I wrote then still holds true: In smaller screen sizes, 4K just isn't worth the money.

This year's TVs still haven't fully sorted out HDMI 2.0 and HDCP 2.2, not all have HEVC (H.265) decoding, and none have any of the potential drool-worthy benefits of Rec 2020.

Things like High Dynamic Range, which could drastically improve picture quality, are still being overlooked for the sake of the almighty resolution number.

And OLED! 4K is definitely slowing the coming of OLED, even if LG showed a few models this year.

Eventually all TVs will be 4K, just as all (or nearly all) of today's TVs are 1080p. That's just how it works. There will be 4K content too, eventually. Wait a year, and the shiny you've got your eye on now will be cheaper, better, and actually able to play back some real 4K content. Save your money.

14. Beware what you see

Vast numbers of commenters have mentioned something that's worth addressing. The showroom floors of Best Buy, Costco, and the rest, have never, in their history, been adequate places to judge the picture quality of a television. Yet somehow, with the advent of 4K, they suddenly are? Illogical, but many are holding it up as truth.

Watching an immaculate 4K signal (that you can't get at home), on a $5,000 television, while it sits among $800 non-local dimming LCDs running barely HD feeds, is not a far comparison. Nor is it indicative of what a 4K TV will look like in your home, running mediocre 4K streaming signals from Netflix or Amazon.

And along the same lines, ultra-high resolution tablets and smartphones prove my point about resolution, not disprove. The closer the screen is to your eyeballs (or the bigger it is), the more resolution you need. That's all I've been saying from the beginning.

15. More voices

I'm not the only one talking about this anymore, thankfully.

CNET's own David Katzmaier just wrote Is now the time to buy a 4K TV?.

Check out Chris Heinonen's 4K Calculator to see if you'd benefit from a 4K TV given the size of the TV you're considering, and where you're sitting.

The Wall Street Journal weighed in.

Cinematographer Steve Yedlin (Looper, The Brothers Bloom) wrote an interesting blog post about 4k..

And oh yeah, Consumer Reports did a side-by-side comparison: 4K content on 4K TVs, and the same movie on Blu-ray with a 1080p TVs. They found, ""...yes--the 4K films did show a noticeable bump in image detail compared to their HD counterparts. But there's a caveat: These differences were not present on all movies, and were visible only when viewed less than 2 feet from the screen, and even then only on certain scenes. When I moved back about 7 feet from the displays, differences between 4K and HD content were not discernible to any meaningful degree.""

Couldn't have said it better myself.

Bottom line

Nothing I say will stop Ultra HD. Look no further than our own CES coverage for proof of that. TV manufactures are smelling margin like blood in the water. This is something they can do, now, and for a profit. So it's happening, whether it's necessary or not. Instead of improving aspects of the image that need fixing, we get 4K because it's easy to do, easy to sell, and easy to demo. Awesome.

So before you jump down my throat for being ""anti-technology"" or ""anti-innovation,"" understand I just want better picture quality in the home, for less money, and Ultra HD 4K is not the best way to do it.

Update: November 22, 2015

A lot has changed in the nearly three years since I first wrote this article. Prices have fallen, new technologies have come out, and there's more (though still not a lot) of 4K content. Today, the best TVs on the market have local dimming, HDR, and Wide Color Gamut... and they also happen to be 4K. Even the best mid-range televisions are 4K. So at this point, if you want a TV that looks good in general, it's going to have Ultra HD resolution (with some exceptions).

So for all to behold, 4K TVs are no longer stupid, and here's why (i.e. read that article first before you comment).

Keep Safe strips out the ads, busy menus, and excess features to offer a clean, easy-to-use, and very fast hidden storage app for your iPhone. Because of this, it immediately trumps the majority of apps in this category, offering something without any gimmicks or tricks for hiding your images -- just a PIN number and hidden folders. More importantly it includes vital features that many other vault apps leave out, such as restoration and sharing tools.

When you open Keep Safe for the first time you are prompted to create a PIN number for the app, and then asked if you want a recovery e-mail address attached. Many apps don't offer this option. If you forget your PIN, you'll never be able to get back into those photos. Here, at least, you have a backup plan if you choose to use it. When you log in, you can load images from your library or take new ones to add them to your private photo roll. You can create folders in which to store them, and best of all, you can move any one photo back to your normal ""unhidden"" folders or share it with someone directly from the app. The interface here is fantastic and allows you to work with your photos all the ways you'd expect and without any of the headaches of other apps.

If you need a hidden photo app for your iPhone, Keep Safe is the one you should download. It's clean, it's easy to use, and it's fast. On top of everything else, it's free without any ad support to slow down performance or get in the way of your photos.",,2023-10-19 14:10:20.055924+00:00,True,False,,,,Secret Photo Vault - Keepsafe - Free download and software reviews - Download.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It offers proactive protection in addition to some neat security features that protect your computer from onsite saboteurs.

In addition to scanning and actively protecting your computer from viruses, SmadAV2013 can scan your registry for nasty information, but not generic errors like a true registry cleaner would. The program's installation process and license agreement seem to be written in Indonesian and you won't get a chance to change the language to English until you've completely installed the program.

The program's virus scan took about 40 minutes to complete, which isn't terribly fast compared to competitors. It makes up for that lack of speed by giving you a process manager that's more detailed than Windows and letting you lock any of your hard drives.

This program isn't bad AV software, but it's too late to the party to win users over the dozens of great options around it. It doesn't offer enough bonuses over the top downloads, either.

ABBYY FineReader Professional is a powerful program that lets you convert your scanned documents and image files into Word, PDF, or other formats. Scan items directly, or use files you already have saved on your computer, and once the program has done its work, you'll be able to search and edit them with ease.

Pros

Excellent interface: This app features a smooth and streamlined interface that makes its features accessible to users of all experience levels. Large buttons denote the various actions you can carry out, including Scan to Word, Scan to PDF, Image to PDF, and Quick Open, among others. The program walks you through the process of initiating the scan, adding pages, and completing the process nicely, and once the recognition phase is completed, your new document will open automatically.

Selection options: In addition to Word and PDF output options, you can also select from several other useful formats. Scan to ePUB, and Scan to HTML are options listed under the More tab, and you can also choose to save scans as images and then convert them later to either Word or PDF.

Cons

Complicated installation: The installation process for this app was long and a bit confusing. There were multiple steps, and instructions weren't always clear about what to do next. There was a Help manual, which explained things clearly, but it didn't seem like it should be necessary to consult the Help document just to open the app. Installation also took nearly 15 minutes to complete.

Frequent mistakes: Even in a very basic page of a document, there were still several errors, most of them involving letters being substituted for numbers. These seemed to happen when the font was slightly different in certain areas, and although some errors are understandable and expected, it doesn't bode well for the results of this recognition technology working on more complex documents.

Bottom Line

ABBYY FineReader Professional provides a valuable service, especially if you often have to work with scanned documents. It will always require you to go back and edit the documents it produces, but depending on the types of documents you're working with, these edits may not be extensive. The free trial is good for 30 days or 100 pages, whichever comes first, and it only allows you to save three pages at a time. The full version costs $169.99.

With more than 5 million likes, DoubleDown Casino is one of the most popular casino games on Facebook. It's now available as a free app for Android devices. DoubleDown Casino Slots is a simplified version of the online game, offering casino-style slot machine games, but in most ways it's a lot like what millions of users have come to expect. DoubleDown Casino Slots can import your game settings and earnings when you log in from Facebook, but you can also register separately or play as a guest. Players logged in through Facebook can even play against their friends and others. We tried this free game while logged on via Wi-Fi over our usual broadband connection.

DoubleDown Casino Slots lets you log in via your Facebook account or as a Guest. We tried both. If you've played this game online, the Android app can access your data. New users won't notice much of a difference, though. When you first run this app, it asks to install some files on your SD card. It probably won't matter to most users, but it's another thing to be aware of. The game's interface has the garishly bright colors and jangly sound typical of online casino games and even more common among their Android versions. We expected nothing less than handheld Vegas, and DoubleDown Casino Slots delivered. The game's basic setup has four slot machines on the floor. We started with the first one, Cleopatra, and won on the first spin. Another spin and we'd won enough to buy some serious chips. DoubleDown Casino Slots' games get much more complex, the more you play and win.

One thing you need to be aware of, though: Unlike most free Android games, DoubleDown Casino requires an active broadband Internet connection. That's not a problem with a Wi-Fi connection, which the developer recommends. But if you're streaming 3G or 4G data from your wireless carrier, time spent at DoubleDown Casino's slots could have an effect similar to a trip to a real casino, if you rack up a big bill.

Richard Browning’s first  lift-off took place in November 2016. With six jet engines strapped to arms and ankles Browning managed to fly across his courtyard in Salisbury for approximately six seconds. It was his first successful lift-off after many failed attempts. “It took a huge amount of perseverance, a lot of hours, and a lot of persistence to cling to the vision that I had,” Browning says. His vision? To build a jetpack. This was something that, according to Browning, conventional wisdom suggested would be too difficult and expensive, but Browning persisted: “I’m not really put off by the setbacks.” Since then, he has repeated the stunt thousands of times, in more than 30 different countries, breaking World Guinness Records. After achieving the seemingly impossible, Browning is now also inspiring a new generation of entrepreneurs, inventors and creatives as part of Porsche’s The Art of the Drive. He also launched jetpack startup Gravity Industries, as its CEO and chief test pilot. While the core of the business still revolves around entertainment, performing demonstration in different locations around the world, Gravity Industries is also working to improve the mobility of paramedics and special forces, especially in emergency situations where deploying a jetpack can help rescuers access hard-to-reach locations quickly. “Where a person is in cardiac arrest or if they’re bleeding baldly, you can genuinely save lives,” Browning says.

54645,https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/how-to-master-the-art-of-passwords/,2022-03-10 15:38:51+00:00,https://www.cnet.com,,"Published on None. Passwords are a way of life for nearly everybody who uses any kind of software. No viable alternative is imminent: fingerprint readers, retina scanners, voice identification, and USB tokens all have limitations. Nothing is as simple and inexpensive as an old-fashioned string of keystrokes.

Web services and network managers nearly always require a minimum degree of password difficulty to prevent standard password-cracking techniques from guessing them quickly. We're also cautioned not to reuse the same passphrases on different sites and are routinely blocked from recycling the passwords we've used previously.

Considering the number of times PC users sign into a service or network each day, we may need to remember a half-dozen hard-to-guess passwords, not to mention the various sign-in IDs we use along with the passwords (full name or first initial-last name? Case sensitive? An e-mail address?). Many computer professionals need access to dozens of secure systems, which stretches the limits of anyone's memory.

Your three options are to use a password-management program, to write your passwords down on paper (or record them in an encrypted text file), or to devise a method for memorizing hard-to-guess passphrases. While no single technique is right for everyone, here's why I suggest the memorization approach.

The pros and cons of password managers

For many people, the best way to protect their data and identity is to use a password manager, which either stores your passwords in the cloud or on a local drive--often a USB thumb drive or other portable storage device. The obvious risk is that the vendor's server is hacked or you lose the drive that stores your passwords.

Last May, the LastPass password-management service reported a breach that may have exposed users' passwords, although LastPass CEO Joe Siegrist stated that people who used strong master passwords were not threatened.

LastPass is available as a Firefox add-on and as an extension for Internet Explorer, Chrome, and other browsers. The version for mobile devices costs $1 per month.

Other password managers work without storing your passwords on a Web server. The Tech Support Alert site recently compared several free password-management programs, including LastPass, RoboForm, and KeePass.

The hard-copy approach to password management

If you forgo the password-manager route, your options are to write your passphrases down or to memorize them. Whenever you record your passwords on paper--even if you record only a mnemonic that reminds you of the actual characters--you've made your accounts a little more susceptible to unauthorized access.

That hasn't stopped computer experts from recommending that users jot down their passwords and keep the paper in a secure location. Gunter Ollman, a researcher for security firm Damballa, concludes that recording your passwords on paper is the lesser of several password evils; more risky is using the same password at multiple sites, setting your software to remember passwords, failing to change passwords frequently, using an easy-to-guess password, and reusing past passwords.

Likewise, computer expert Bruce Schneier reiterated on his Schneier on Security blog the advice of Microsoft executive Jesper Johansson to record your passwords on paper to encourage use of strong passwords.

The obvious downside of the paper approach is that someone will find the paper taped to the bottom of your keyboard or tucked into your wallet and access your private data before you're able to take preventive measures. Or you may simply lose the paper and have to do the recover-password-by-e-mail two-step for each network and service you need to access.

The wetware approach to password storage is still the safest

As you might have guessed, Mr. Schneier's 2005 post recommending that you write down your passwords generated quite a few comments to the contrary. Most of the commenters suggested their own technique for remembering strong passwords.

Of course, the bad guys pay close attention to this information and will attempt to incorporate the approaches in their password-cracking efforts. The key is to get creative in altering something you've already memorized, such as song lyrics, family members' first names, or place names from your past.

An alternative method leverages something nearby. For example, there may be a product near your workstation that has a prominent model or serial number, or a book within view of your seat has an ISBN number on the back cover. Rather than using the exact number, add or subtract two or three numbers or letters, so ""1158748562"" becomes ""3370960784,"" or ""BCGA1339"" becomes ""DEIC3551.""

The only problem I've encountered with my own password-mnemonic creation is that some vendors require a mix of upper and lower case letters and numbers. I have become resigned to having to go through Apple's ""Forgot your password?"" e-mail routine about every other week.

This is doubly upsetting because my system uses from 12 to 16 random alphabetic characters (found in no dictionary and following no discernible pattern). As the How Secure Is My Password site indicates, the all-text, all-lower-case password I devised would take much more effort to crack than an eight-character password that meets Apple's requirements.

Check the strength of your passwords at the How Secure Is My Password site, which indicates how difficult your password is to crack, and whether it's on the site's common-password list. screenshot by Dennis O'Reilly

However, I give props to Apple and other sites that enforce strict password-creation policies, as well as to network managers who do the same. Efforts are underway to address the strong-password conundrum. As CNET contributor Lance Whitney described in post last week, Microsoft is working to improve the password-management capabilities of Windows 8 and Internet Explorer 10.

Only time will tell whether PC users will ever be able to securely store their sign-in credentials in their systems' software or on a service's Web server. For most people, the safest approach to passwords is to rely only on their own personal gray matter. Let's hope a secure alternative to passwords arrives before our memories give out.",,2023-10-28 07:25:27.140887+00:00,True,False,,,,How to master the art of passwords - CNET,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Face on Coins Booth is a photo editing app that allows you to place your face or any other photo on the back or front of a mock coin. With numerous options for how the mock coin looks and how your image is filtered through and onto the coin, this is a great app that can be a lot of fun to play around with. While there are no paper money options in this version of the app (there is a separate iOS app for paper money), you can do quite a bit with just coins.

Once you install and prepare your first image, you can start adding photos to coins in the library. The default is a generic looking penny, but there are other colors and layouts of coins, and you can change the text on the coin, the image used (either your own photo or one from your library), and the face of the coin. The app runs smoothly and the interface is intuitive, allowing you to make quick changes to the final coin image. Everything is fast to set up and the images look good enough to share on social networks when you are done.

If you are interested in an app that will allow you to add your face to a coin without a lot of cumbersome ads and extra menus, consider Face on Coins Booth. It lacks a lot of the meat that other photo editing apps have, but it works smoothly and the resulting coin images are a lot of fun to share with friends and family.",,2023-10-28 09:02:31.517291+00:00,True,False,,,,Face On Coins Booth - Free download and software reviews - Download.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
