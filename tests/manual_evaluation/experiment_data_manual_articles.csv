5693,https://www.cnet.com/culture/the-playstation-network-breach-faq/,2022-03-11 01:58:00+00:00,https://www.cnet.com,,"Published on None. It's been a roller coaster of a couple of weeks for Sony and its customers.

At first what seemed like an embarrassing network outage that kept customers from accessing PlayStation Network, Sony's online game play and streaming video service, turned out to be much worse: a sophisticated cyberattack made off with the customer data of 77 million PSN and Qriocity customers.

Sony wasn't very forthcoming with information at first--it was a couple days before it acknowledged why PSN was offline, and two days after that it confirmed the security breach. Then over the weekend, the No. 2 guy at Sony, Kazuo Hirai, took the stage at a hastily organized press conference in Tokyo to try to explain what led to the attack, what exactly was stolen in the intrusion on its network, and how Sony plans to compensate its customers.

And then just when it seemed Sony was on its way to start recovering from the debacle, more bad news hit: Sony said yesterday the same breach that compromised PSN and Qriocity customer information extends to Sony Online Entertainment customers too. Information about subscribers to the multiplayer online game service--names, addresses, e-mail, genders, birthdates, phone numbers, usernames, and passwords--was exposed, as was an ""outdated"" database of credit cards from 12,700 non-U.S. customers as part of the same intrusion on its network two weeks ago, Sony said in a statement.

Is the news about SOE where this story ends? Sony swears that its main credit card database wasn't compromised since it's separate from servers running PSN, Qriocity, and SOE. But the company's investigation into the breach continues, and it's possible there's still more to come.

In the meantime, we've pulled together all the available information about the attack and its fallout from the last two weeks and put it here. We'll update this FAQ as we find out more.

When will PlayStation Network and Qriocity be back online?

We don't know an exact day, but on Saturday night Sony said most PSN and Qriocity services will be available again ""this week."" On Tuesday, when it announced the breach, the company said services would be restored ""within the week,"" which suggested Tuesday this week at the latest.

But even when Sony does flip the switch, not all services will be restored right away.

What will be available first: online game play for PS3 and PSP, watching downloaded movies and other unexpired rental content, Music Unlimited by Qriocity, friends lists, chat functionality, and PlayStation Home.

Most importantly, customers will finally be able to reset their password and manage their accounts.

How did the attack against PSN go down?

Between April 17 and 19, a so-far unnamed person illegally gained access to Sony's PSN servers in San Diego, Calif., by hacking into an application server behind a Web server and two firewalls. According to Sony Chief Information Officer Shinji Hajesima, the attack was disguised as a purchase, so it did not immediately raise any red flags. The vulnerability the attacker was able to exploit was known, according to Sony.

Sony flagged the attack on April 19 and on April 20 shut down PSN as well as Qriocity. The company hired security experts and contacted the FBI to investigate the exploit and find out what took place. Sony says it didn't actually learn for certain that personal information was exposed until April 25.

Sony described the attack as ""very sophisticated"" and still does not know the intruder's identity.

Did Sony really not encrypt passwords?

While credit card data was encrypted, Sony admitted that customer names, birthdates, addresses, user names, and passwords were not. But neither did it store them in cleartext, the company said today. Cleartext refers to storing information in a way that's readable to humans without any processing.

""While the passwords that were stored were not 'encrypted,' they were transformed using a cryptographic hash function. There is a difference between these two types of security measures which is why we said the passwords had not been encrypted,"" wrote Sony spokesman Patrick Seybold today. ""But I want to be very clear that the passwords were not stored in our database in cleartext form.""

Is there any evidence anyone's been the victim of identity theft or credit card fraud as a result?

Sony says so far they have not seen any evidence to suggest that. Last week, it was rumored that a group of hackers was selling a database of customer information and credit card data said to be from PSN and had attempted to sell it back to Sony. Company spokesman Seybold has repeatedly denied this.

There were 77 million customers with profiles set up on PSN that included their names, birthdate, and address, but only 10 million of them had uploaded their credit card information for purchasing and renting content, according to Sony.

What is Sony doing to make sure this type of breach doesn't happen again?

First, Sony Computer Entertainment is creating a new position, chief security information officer. SCE is the business division responsible for gaming at Sony. Whoever occupies the post will report to Hasejima, chief information officer of Sony.

Sony was already planning to move its PSN servers from San Diego to another unnamed location. As a result of the attack, Sony is speeding up that move.

Sony says it is upgrading PSN server system security, including adding automated software monitoring and configuration management, enhancing data encryption, and implementing more firewalls, Hirai said this weekend.

Sony keeps apologizing, but how will it make it up to me as a customer?

Sony says it will help customers enroll in free identity theft monitoring, something that will be handled differently depending on the region. There so far is not a lot of detail regarding how this will work, but a Sony spokesperson says more information will be forthcoming.

The company has also instituted a ""Welcome Back"" program to encourage its customers to return to using PSN. It will vary in different regions, but the basics are this: Sony will offer free downloads of ""entertainment content,"" current PSN customers will get free PlayStation Plus (a paid premium service) for 30 days, current PS Plus customers who've already paid for a monthly or yearly membership will also get 30 days free (we still don't know how Sony plans to implement this--a refund? Or just an extra 30 days free?), and current Music Unlimited by Qriocitysubscribers get 30 days of free service.

The company hasn't yet said how it will compensate SOE customers.",,2023-10-17 06:14:09.080456+00:00,True,True,False,,,The PlayStation Network breach (FAQ) - CNET,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

33104,https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/hackers-blackmailed-silk-road-underground/,2015-01-29 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnet.com,,"Published on None. Hackers extorted thousands of dollars out of the Silk Road marketplace through threats of hitting the site with denial-of-service attacks or exposing severe security vulnerabilities, according to testimony in US District Court.

Hackers and security specialists come in many different guises -- from white-hat teams that pinpoint vulnerabilities and conduct penetration testing with the overall aim of improving network security, to black-hats using their skills for personal gain, and to the occasional ""hacktivist"" and script kiddie who take down websites for political means, or just because they can.

It doesn't take much for one to realize that illegal marketplaces, such as Silk Road, are vulnerable to the same hackers against which corporations attempt to protect themselves. The only difference is that one is on the side of the law that grants the right to call in law enforcement as they wish. Naturally, when a website offers illegal services, operators cannot call the police to assist in cases of blackmail and extortion.

This scenario is one in which the Silk Road marketplace found itself in between 2012 and 2013, as reported by Computerworld. On Wednesday, reporters attending an evidence hearing in federal court in Manhattan discovered that the underground website was forced to pay thousands of dollars to cybercriminals threatening to tear down Silk Road by exposing security vulnerabilities or launching ""denial of service"" salvos.

On at least two occasions, Silk Road operators paid hackers a ransom to keep the website running and secure.

The extortions were documented during testimony from Internal Revenue Service special agent Gary Alford, who, according to the publication, subpoenaed the emails of defendant Ross Ulbricht as part of US law enforcement's investigation into Silk Road.

During Alford's testimony, one hacker allegedly emailed Silk Road, revealing the existence of a serious security vulnerability. The hacker asked for $5,000 to keep quiet or $15,000 to forward details on the flaw and how it could be exploited. A spreadsheet documenting financial transactions appears to show $15,000 being paid out shortly after. In addition, $10,000 was paid to try and prevent a distributed ""denial of service"" attack from taking place.

The Silk Road marketplace, which operated within the Tor network, was closed down in 2013 by federal agents.

Ulbricht, allegedly the Silk Road admin ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" is on trial for criminal enterprise charges related to the website. Charges against the 30-year-old Texan include conspiracy to commit computer hacking and money laundering and the sale of narcotics. US prosecutors say that drugs worth $200 million were sold through the website internationally, where goods -- including weaponry and hacking tools -- were also available for purchase through the use of digital currency Bitcoin.

The defendant has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Ulbricht, who claims he left the site a few months after it launched and was only lured back to be framed by the ""real"" Dread Pirate Robers, potentially faces life imprisonment.

US District Judge Katherine Forrest is overseeing the trial, which is expected to take between four and six weeks.

Having a pet can dramatically improve the level of social interaction in autistic children, researchers have said.

Although previous research has focused on dogs, a new study claims any kind of pet has a similar effect.

The University of Missouri researchers say there is a huge benefit from having a pet.

Having a pet can dramatically improve the level of social interaction in autistic children, researchers have said (stock image)

HOW THEY DID IT Researchers surveyed 70 families who had children with autism between the ages of 8 and 18. The children were patients at the MU Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders. Almost 70 percent of the families that participated had dogs, and about half of the families had cats. Other pets owned by participants included fish, farm animals, rodents, rabbits, reptiles, a bird and even one spider.

'When I compared the social skills of children with autism who lived with dogs to those who did not, the children with dogs appeared to have greater social skills,' said Gretchen Carlisle, research fellow at theResearch Center for Human-Animal Interaction (ReCHAI) in the MU College of Veterinary Medicine.

'More significantly, however, the data revealed that children with any kind of pet in the home reported being more likely to engage in behaviors such as introducing themselves, asking for information or responding to other people's questions.

'These kinds of social skills typically are difficult for kids with autism, but this study showed children's assertiveness was greater if they lived with a pet.'

Pets often serve as 'social lubricants,' Carlisle said.

When pets are present in social settings or a classroom, children talk and engage more with one another.

This effect also seems to apply to children with autism and could account for their increased assertiveness when the children are living in a home with pets, Carlisle said.

'When children with disabilities take their service dogs out in public, other kids stop and engage,' Carlisle said.

'Kids with autism don't always readily engage with others, but if there's a pet in the home that the child is bonded with and a visitor starts asking about the pet, the child may be more likely to respond.'

Carlisle also found that children's social skills increased the longer a family had owned a dog, yet older children rated their relationships with their dogs as weaker.

When children were asked, they reported the strongest attachments to smaller dogs, Carlisle found.

'Finding children with autism to be more strongly bonded to smaller dogs, and parents reporting strong attachments between their children and other pets, such as rabbits or cats, serves as evidence that other types of pets could benefit children with autism as well,' Carlisle said.

Other pets owned by participants included fish, farm animals, rodents, rabbits, reptiles, a bird and even one spider.

'Dogs are good for some kids with autism but might not be the best option for every child,' Carlisle said. 'Kids with autism are highly individual and unique, so some other animals may provide just as much benefit as dogs. Though parents may assume having dogs are best to help their children, my data show greater social skills for children with autism who live in homes with any type of pet.'

'The Social Skills and Attachment to Dogs of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder' was published in theJournal of Autism and Developmental Disorders. Sigma Theta Tau-Alpha Iota provided funding for the project.

Fans of Jamie Oliver were exposed to potential malware attacks after the celebrity chef's website was hacked.

JamieOliver.com, which brings in around 10million visitors a month with recipes and news about the star, hosted a link to another website which if visited could have attacked viewers' computers.

The bug has now been removed and the star has apologised to anyone affected by the issue.

Computer security experts were shocked to see a malware virus on Jamie Oliver's website (pictured after bug was removed) this week

The hack was spotted by experts at Malwarebytes who described the virus as 'a well hidden malicious injection in the site itself'.

Hackers could have taken control of the users' computers if they had downloaded the malware, experts say.

A spokesman for Jamie Oliver played down the incident, saying: 'The team at jamieoliver.com found a low level malware problem and dealt with it quickly. The site is now safe to use.

'We have had only a handful of comments from users over the last couple of days and no-one has reported any serious issues. We apologise to anyone who was at all worried after going on the site.

'The Jamie Oliver website is regularly checked for vulnerabilities by both our in-house team and an independent third party and they quickly deal with anything that is found.

'The team is confident that no data has been compromised in this incident but if anyone is worried, do please use the contact form on the site.'

The star has apologised to fans and insisted his website is regularly checked and is now safe to use

David Emm principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab said: 'The news that Jamie Oliver's website has been hacked is yet another reminder of how careful everyone needs to be when using the Internet.

HACK ATTACK: WHAT IS MALWARE? Short for 'malicious software', malware refers to any bugs designed to damage computer systems. The most common examples of malware include 'viruses', 'trojan horses', and 'spyware'. Viruses can randomly delete files on the host computer's hard drive while spyware can gather information from a user's system without the user knowing it. This can include the web pages a user visits or personal information, such as credit card numbers, stored on the computer.

'Many people have potentially been exposed to malicious software by simply clicking on something that looks legitimate.

The official site of TV chef Jamie Oliver, which sees an average of 10m visits per month, has been compromised by hackers serving malicious files to visitors which could take control of their computers.



JamieOliver.com, which is ranked number 538 in the UK according to analytics firm Alexa, was hacked into by criminals, either through a compromised plugin used by Oliver’s site or through stolen login details for the site.

The attack was spotted by security firm Malware Bytes, which alerted Oliver’s site operators. The site appears to have since been cleaned of the malicious files.

Visitors were shown another website embedded directly into the site, which attacked their computers through bugs in Flash, Microsoft’s Silverlight and Java.

If successful, the attackers then installed malware on to the users’ computers, leading to the installation of more malicious software.

The attackers could then use the computer to launch further attacks as part of a botnet, steal data and send spam, among other uses. It is not known how many users fell victim to the attacks.

“It all started with a compromised JavaScript hosted on jamieoliver.com. It could be a legitimate script that has been injected with additional content or a rogue script altogether,” explained senior security researcher Jérôme Segura. “The webmasters will need to look for additional evidence of infection, rather than simply restore or delete the offending script.

“Contrary to most web-borne exploits we see lately, this one was not the result of a malicious ad (malvertising) but rather a carefully and well hidden malicious injection in the site itself,” said Segura.

Carl Leonard, principal security researcher at Websense, said: “The code can come back at any moment if webmasters are not prepared. If end users are browsing to such sites, companies need to ensure … that threats hosted on the far-reaching corners of the web are stopped in their tracks.”

A spokesperson for the Jamie Oliver group told the Guardian: “The team at jamieoliver.com found a low level malware problem and dealt with it quickly. The site is now safe to use. We have had only a handful of comments from users over the last couple of days, and no-one has reported any serious issues. The team is confident that no data has been compromised in this incident but if anyone is worried, do please use the contact form on the site.”

“We apologise to anyone who was at all worried after going on the site.”",,2023-10-23 07:44:23.235223+00:00,True,True,True,,0.9635991493803863,Jamie Oliver’s site serves up a tasty slice of malware - The Guardian,,"The software failure incident occurred on the official site of TV chef Jamie Oliver.

It's an infinitesimally small percentage of the human race that gets to don a space suit, but if you've ever aspired to walk in space, two new pairs of Adidas sneakers will at least let you feel a bit astronauty.

Designed by Christian Dior creative director Raf Simons in his fifth year of collaboration with the German brand, the shoes are based on two pre-existing Adidas shoes -- Ozweego and Response Trail. The shoes are named Ozweego Robot and Response Trail Robot, which doesn't make a huge amount of sense if they're inspired by astronauts, but they certainly look the part.

""Inspired by vintage astronaut suits and backpacks, moulded and machined details similar to authentic closures, zippers and straps are added,"" Adidas said in a statement. ""Shiny versus matte distressed materials complete the look of outer space.""

NASA's first space suits, made for the Mercury mission, were only worn inside the space craft, and were stitched out of a silver material. By the time the second space suits rolled around -- for the Gemini mission -- NASA had switched to a white fabric, with red and blue elements, which were made much more prominent for the Apollo suits.

The shoes are due to hit selected retailers sometime in July, with an expected price range between $455 and $730. Or you could try to make yourself a pair of magnetic astronaut boots, which sounds at least the same level of fun.",,2023-10-23 07:49:01.691696+00:00,True,False,,,,Adidas reveals sneakers inspired by vintage NASA space suits - CNET,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34381,https://apnews.com/general-news-e6fbe668516148d288ee1f94e2be1f65,2015-03-10 07:00:00+00:00,https://apnews.com,,"Published on 2015-03-10 19:06:22. BOSTON (AP) — Charla Nash never served in the military. She was horribly disfigured, not in combat, but in a 2009 attack by a rampaging chimpanzee. The Pentagon, though, is watching her recovery closely.

The U.S. military paid for Nash’s full face transplant in 2011, as well as face transplants for a small group of other civilians. The agency is also underwriting Nash’s follow-up treatment at a combined cost estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars in the hope that some of the things it learns can help young, seriously disfigured soldiers returning from war.

In the coming weeks, for example, Nash will take part in a military-funded experiment in which doctors at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital will try to wean her off the anti-rejection drugs she has been taking since the transplant.

Nash jokes about sometimes feeling like a science project. But the 61-year-old daughter of an Air Force veteran said she gets real satisfaction out of letting the doctors use her for research, and she sees it as an opportunity to help wounded soldiers and “do something good out of all of this bad.”

“They asked me, could they? I said, ‘Yeah, I’d be thrilled to help out in any way I could,’” said Nash, a former Connecticut resident who now lives on her own in Boston with the help of part-time aides.

Nash lost her nose, lips, eyelids and hands when she was mauled by her employer’s 200-pound pet chimpanzee in Stamford, Connecticut. Doctors also had to remove her eyes because of a disease transmitted by the chimp.

She later received new facial features taken from a dead woman. She also underwent a double hand transplant, but it failed when her body rejected the tissue.

Now blind, Nash spends most of her days listening to AM radio and books on tape — lately, “War and Peace” — in her modest, second-story apartment. She also exercises a couple of days a week with a trainer at a gym to build her strength and stay healthy. A GoFundMe account is being set up to help raise money for prosthetic hands, which would not be covered by the Department of Defense.

Her life today is a stark contrast to her younger years, when she was a barrel racer on the rodeo circuit from the 1970s through the mid-1990s. Over the years, she also did some horse-jumping, worked on a farm and manned a computer help desk. She was working as a dispatcher for a towing company at the time of the attack.

About every six weeks, Nash undergoes lab tests for the military at Brigham and Women’s. She is also subjected to MRIs and CT scans to determine how well her brain is sending signals to her new face. In addition, doctors examine how well the arteries are delivering blood to the transplant.

The military is also interested in such things as any scarring around the mouth and how well her eyelids work.

“It makes sense for us to look at the civilian community and the experiences that are gained through the involvement of non-uniformed people to assess if this is a good solution for the military,” said Dr. Brian Pfister, a portfolio manager for the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command’s Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine research program.

About 35 full or partial face transplants have been performed worldwide since the first one was done in France in 2005. The Defense Department estimates 560 soldiers have suffered severe facial wounds in Iraq and Afghanistan. Of those, about 50 or 60 might be candidates for a face transplant, Pfister said.

The Pentagon is providing grants to 14 medical facilities across the U.S. through its hand and face transplantation program. The face and the extremities are the two most frequently injured parts of the body in war.

The new experiment, involving the suspension of anti-rejection drugs, will eventually include other patients, and its findings could potentially affect hundreds of thousands of people, military and civilian alike, doctors said.

The immunosuppression drugs that transplant patients are typically given for the rest of their lives carry such risks as cancer, viral infections and kidney damage. Because of those dangers, many transplants of non-vital body parts, such as thumbs, are not considered worth doing.

But that could change if the drugs don’t have to be a lifelong commitment.

“Suddenly, it’s not as crazy to think about transplanting individual fingers or an ear,” said Dr. Bohdan Pomahac, who led Nash’s transplant surgery team.

Nash will be switched to a different substance, Interleukin-2, which is normally used to treat skin and kidney cancers. The hope is that it will promote growth of good cells that protect the transplant while attacking those that want to reject it.

Pomahac said Nash is doing “remarkably well” and has experienced very few rejection episodes, making her a good candidate for the experiment.

“I think there’s an overarching purpose in her life. She really wants to help in whatever way she can,” he said. “She’s very much a forward-looking woman.”",,2023-10-23 10:27:12.427336+00:00,True,False,,,,US military hopes to learn from victim of chimp attack - The Associated Press,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34903,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/software-glitch-causes-f-35-to-incorrectly-detect-targets-in-formation,2015-03-25 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.foxnews.com,,"Published on None. Engineers are trying to fix the F-35’s software package after it was discovered the sensors for the Joint Strike Fighter malfunction when detecting targets when the aircraft flies in formation.

Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, Program Executive Officer, F-35, said he didn’t have a date when the correction would be made. However, he said the problem would not delay the declaration of the Marine variant of the aircraft, the F-35B, ready for combat.

“When you have two, three or four F-35s looking at the same threat, they don’t all see it exactly the same because of the angles that they are looking at and what their sensors pick up,” Bogdan told reporters Tuesday. “When there is a slight difference in what those four airplanes might be seeing, the fusion model can’t decide if it’s one threat or more than one threat. If two airplanes are looking at the same thing, they see it slightly differently because of the physics of it.”

For example, if a group of F-35s detect a single ground threat such as anti-aircraft weaponry, the sensors on the planes may have trouble distinguishing whether it was an isolated threat or several objects, Bogdan explained.

As a result, F-35 engineers are working with Navy experts and academics from John’s Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory to adjust the sensitivity of the fusion algorithms for the JSF’s 2B software package so that groups of planes can correctly identify or discern threats.

“What we want to have happen is no matter which airplane is picking up the threat – whatever the angles or the sensors – they correctly identify a single threat and then pass that information to all four airplanes so that all four airplanes are looking at the same threat at the same place,” Bogdan said.

The F-35 is engineered to fuse relevant information from a variety of sources into one common operating picture for the pilot to view – such as digital maps, radar information and sensor information all combined into a single set of screens, JSF officials said.

The F-35’s Electro-Optical Target System, or EOTS, is an infra-red sensor able to assist pilots with air and ground targeting at increased standoff ranges while also performing laser designation, laser range-finding and other tasks.

In addition, the plane’s Distributed Aperture System, or DAS, is a series of six electro-optical sensors able to give information to the pilot. The DAS includes precision tracking, fire control capabilities and the ability to warn the pilot of an approaching threat or missile.

The F-35s also have an Active Electronically Scanned Array Radar which is able to track a host of electromagnetic signals, including returns from Synthetic Aperture Radar, or SAR. SAR paints a picture of the contours of the ground or surrounding terrain and Ground Moving Target Indicator, or GMTI, locates something on-the-move-on the ground and airborne objects or threats.

Overall, information from all of the JSF sensors is fused through the aircraft’s computer, providing the pilot with clear, integrated view of the battlefield. The aircraft also have a data link enabling them to share information with one another in real time.

The F-35 software, which shows images on display screens in the cockpit as well as on a pilot’s helmet-mounted-display, is designed to fuse results from various radar capabilities onto a single screen for the pilot.

The Marine Corps plans to declare their short-take-off-and-landing F-35B variant ready for combat by June of this year by declaring what’s called Initial Operating Capability, or IOC, with the 2B version of the software.

Software Block 2B, while still short of the full final 3F software configuration, can provide data link capabilities and early fused sensor integration, program officials have said.

Block 2B can provide basic close air support and fire an AMRAAM (Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile), JDAM [Joint Direct Attack Munition] or GBU 12 [laser-guided aerial bomb], JSF program officials said.

“We will declare IOC with an older version of the software that does not have all the fixes in it. They (Marine Corps) have ways of mitigating those problems which they feel are sufficient for them to go to war,” Bogdan said.

Bogdan explained how F-35B pilots will be able to use concepts of operation to work around the sensor fusion problems until the software fixes are in place. Some of these tactics could include turning off certain sensors or flying in groups of two instead of four planes, Bogdan explained.

“We want to fix this so it is inherent in the airplane. We have always said that fusion was going to be tough. We are going to work through this,” Bogdan said.

The failure was related to the sensors for the Joint Strike Fighter, specifically when detecting targets while the aircraft flies in formation. The failure was caused by the angles at which the planes were looking at the threat and the differences in what their sensors picked up. This caused the fusion model to be unable to determine if it was one threat or multiple threats. The impact of the failure was that the planes had trouble distinguishing between an isolated threat and several objects. The responsible entities for fixing the failure are F-35 engineers, Navy experts, and academics from John's Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. The impacted entity is the F-35 aircraft. The engineers are working to adjust the sensitivity of the fusion algorithms in the software package so that groups of planes can correctly identify and discern threats. The goal is to have all planes looking at the same threat at the same place, regardless of the angles or sensors. The Marine variant of the F-35, the F-35B, will still be declared ready for combat by June of this year, despite the software failure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[-0.04142799973487854,

ISTANBUL/ANKARA (Reuters) - Defne Bayrak’s husband was a suicide bomber who killed CIA operatives in a 2009 attack in Afghanistan. Now, she is among the hundreds of Turks using social media to show support for Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq.

Turkey, a Sunni Muslim nation with a secular constitution, is a member, albeit reluctantly, of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State. Most of its 77 million people are deeply opposed to the militant group’s savage tactics.

But pockets of Turkish social media hum with pro-Islamic State activity and at least six websites provide daily updates on its self-declared caliphate, carved out in Syria and Iraq. An October survey by pollster Metropoll said up to 12 percent of Turks do not see the group as a “terrorist organisation”.

This sympathy is of growing concern to officials in Ankara, diplomats and security experts say, as they fear a network of fighters, recruiters and facilitators is being cultivated in Turkey to support Islamic State operations over the border.

Turkey has stepped up its efforts to destroy these networks but analysts say pushing the militants too far could lead to the EU candidate nation becoming a target itself, particularly ahead of June elections.

“From the beginning Turkey didn’t fully appreciate the danger of the Islamic State networks. Now it has become riskier to dismantle them,” said Bahadir Dincer, Middle East Expert at the Ankara-based think-tank USAK.

“A Daesh (Islamic State) attack is the number one threat for Turkey at the moment ... This is a huge risk for the government before the elections.”

Bayrak, her Twitter page emblazoned with the Islamic State logo and pictures of the group’s fighters riding on pick-up trucks, tweeted last week that she had “migrated to the land of the caliph”.

“People said Islamic State accused people of being infidels, hanged and killed people. I have seen no such thing since my arrival,” she said in one tweet. “My God would grant their successors the conquest of Rome,” she said in another.

Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has estimated that the number of Turks who have joined Islamic State is around 500-700, lower than from some European countries, although some diplomats put the number of Turks in the thousands.

U.S. officials have estimated that as many as 15,000 foreign fighters are operating in Syria alone, including 3,000 Westerners, many of whom crossed through Turkey.

CRACKDOWN

The Turkish authorities say they have blocked entry to Turkey to more than 7,000 would-be jihadists in recent years.

There have been dozens of detentions and deportations in recent months, most recently a British couple with four young children suspected of trying to travel to an Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.

But the crackdown, carried out under pressure from concerned European partners, has ratcheted up the risk that Turkey itself becomes a target for returning militants.

Halis Bayancuk, a Turkish cleric detained several times on suspicion of aiding al Qaeda, cautioned Ankara against taking a more active role in the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State.

“I believe Turkey could be harmed because of it,” Bayancuk, also known as ‘Abu Hanzala’, said in an apartment-turned-prayer room on a run-down street in Istanbul’s Gunesli neighbourhood.

“I wouldn’t know what kind of harm. But if you team up with the West in their war ... you’d lose all legitimacy in the eyes of the people of the Middle East.”

Bayancuk was detained three times between 2008 and 2014 on suspicion of being a leading member of al Qaeda in Turkey.

Turkish media have said the 31-year-old is suspected of fund raising for militant groups and of helping foreign fighters pass into Syria. He vehemently denies that his small community of followers, many of whom read his sermons and articles online, has links to either al Qaeda or Islamic State.

While the website Bayancuk writes for does not praise Islamic State or militant Islamist groups, other sites still accessible in Turkey openly do, despite new laws which the government has used to block access to Twitter, Facebook and other content it deems inappropriate.

Turkey’s challenge, diplomats say, is balancing the need to fulfil its obligations to its Western and regional allies without making itself a target for insurgents who control swathes of territory just over its southern borders.

“If Turkey starts doing harm to these networks, some of which are fully operational, there would be a backlash, and they’re afraid of that,” said one Western diplomat.",,2023-10-23 13:34:44.816325+00:00,True,False,,,,Turkey faces delicate battle against Islamic State sympathisers at home - Reuters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After months of speculation Microsoft has officially announced its Windows 10 software will launch globally on 29 July.

The Washington-based firm said Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users will have one year from this date to take advantage of the free upgrade.

And once a device is upgraded to Windows 10, Microsoft said it will continue to keep it up-to-date for the supported lifetime of the device at no cost.

Microsoft (Joey Belfiore, corporate vice president Operating Systems Group) has officially announced its Windows 10 software will launch globally on 29 July. The Washington-based firm said Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users will have one year from this date July to take advantage of the free upgrade

For other Windows users, or people who don't currently run a version of the firm's operating system, they will need to pay for the software.

Microsoft hasn't announced pricing but details leaked on a reseller over the weekend suggest it will start at $109.99 for the Home edition, and $149.99 for the Professional version.

It is not known if these prices will convert exactly in other regions, but a direct conversion into pounds prices this at £72 and £99 respectively.

Microsoft said those who want to be among the first in line for the free Windows 10 upgrade can reserve a free copy in the coming weeks.

WHAT'S NEW IN WINDOWS 10 Microsoft's new operating system will run on the 'broadest types of devices ever'. It will come with Cortana and the personal assistant app will run on the desktop. It merges various app stores into one platform, called the One Store. Microsoft is bringing back the Start Menu, which was removed from Windows 8. And users can create multiple desktops to keep things organised.

The software was unveiled earlier this year.

It will run on everything from mobile phones to the firm's Xbox One games console - and for desktop users, will see the return of the start menu.

And it will come with Microsoft's Cortana digital assistant, and Spartan, a new web browser to replace internet Explorer, built in.

The firm also showed off an augmented reality headset called HoloLens running the software.

Microsoft boss Satya Nadella described HoloLens as 'magical' - but would not say how much it will cost.

'Windows 10 and holographic computing are mindblowing experiences,' he said.

The headset is still a prototype being developed under the codename Project Baraboo, and Microsoft did not say when the HoloLens would go on sale.

Other Windows users, or people who don't currently run a version of the firm's operating system, will need to pay for the software. Microsoft hasn't announced pricing, but details leaked on a reseller over the weekend suggest it will start at $109.99 for the Home edition, and $149.99 for the Professional version (shown)

Windows 10 will include a new Xbox app to allow users to easily share with friends, and is extremely similar to the firm's Xbox One console system. Once a device is upgraded to Windows 10, Microsoft said it will continue to keep it up-to-date for the supported lifetime of the device at no cost

Although the firm has not revealed exactly how it works, Microsoft HoloLens intelligently maps the room you’re in, blending holograms with the environment around you.

'The feedback we've received is truly shaping Windows 10,' said Terry Myserson of Microsoft. 'Today is a monumental day for Windows.

And Microsoft admitted the software was 'at a threshold' after the poorly received Windows 8.

Mr Myerson added: 'There's about one and a half billion people using Windows today. Devices outnumber people.

'Windows is at a threshold and now it's time for a new Windows. Our new Windows must be built from the ground up for a mobile first, cloud first world.

'It wouldn't be right to call it Windows 9.'

A 'technical preview' of the desktop and laptop version is already available - although is expected to receive a major update following the launch.

The software was unveiled earlier this year. It will run on everything from mobile phones to the firm's Xbox One games console. The firm also showed off an augmented reality headset called HoloLens (pictured) running the software. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella described HoloLens as 'magical' but wouldn't say how much it will cost

It also marks the return of the Start Menu, which was removed from Windows 8.

In addition to offering a list of the user's favourite applications, the menu brings up resizable tiles - similar to those featured in Windows 8's touch-centric interface - on PCs and tablets.

The current version, Windows 8, has been widely derided for forcing radical behavioural changes.

Microsoft is restoring some of the more traditional ways of doing things and promises that Windows 10 will be familiar for users regardless of which version of Windows they are now using.

'Windows 10 will deliver the right experience, at the right time. Windows 10 will be our most comprehensive platform, ever,' said Mr Myerson.

Microsoft's Joe Belfiore (left), Alex Kipman, and Terry Myerson (right) pose while wearing Hololens

Windows 10 marks the return of the Start Menu, which was removed from Windows 8. The new Start Menu has the traditional list layout of previous versions, combined with the tile set-up introduced in Windows 8 (shown)

'We're delivering one application platform. One store, one way for applications to be discovered, purchased, and updated across all of these devices.'

For instance, the start menu in Windows 10 will appear similar to what's found in Windows 7, but tiles opening to the side will resemble what's found in Windows 8.

Windows 10 would be compatible with both traditional and touch-based device users like tablets through a new task view with buttons scaled up so that they're more friendly to those on touchscreen devices.

Users on hybrid devices like the Surface Pro tablet will be able to jump between and keyboard and touchscreen modes, with Microsoft demonstrating how the interface will change as you do.

Although the new software won't be formally released until next year, analysts already consider its success crucial for Microsoft and Satya Nadella.

The new software will also allow users on hybrid devices such as the Surface Pro to jump between keyboard and touchscreen modes, with Microsoft demonstrating how the interface will change as you do (pictured)

Windows 10 new is designed to bring together all of Microsoft's different hardware, such as a the surface tablet (left) and the Xbox One (right) under the same software

The new software represents an attempt to step back from the radical redesign that alienated many PC users when Windows 8 was introduced two years ago.

However, it is not a complete retreat from Microsoft's goal of bridging the gap between PCs and mobile devices: It still has touch-screen functions and strives to create a familiar experience for Windows users who switch between desktop computers, tablets and smartphones.

Microsoft currently has three main systems - Windows 8 for traditional computers and tablets, Windows Phone 8 for cellphones and Xbox for its gaming console.

By unifying the underlying systems, software developers will be able to create apps for the various devices more easily.",,2023-10-23 16:09:54.785503+00:00,True,False,,,,Microsoft's Windows 10 to launch on 29 July - Daily Mail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36034,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/20/flickr-complaints-offensive-auto-tagging-photos,2015-05-20 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2015-05-20 00:00:00. Flickr is facing a user revolt after a new auto-tagging system labelled images of black people with tags such as “ape” and “animal” as well as tagging pictures of concentration camps with “sport” or “jungle gym”.

The system, which was introduced in early May, uses what Flickr describes as “advanced image recognition technology” to automatically categorise photos into a number of broad groups.

For instance, a picture of a newspaper cartoon can be automatically given the tags “drawing”, “sketch”, “cartoon”, “text”, and “writing”, in addition to whatever else the uploader decides to add to the photo. Other tags the system can automatically append include “outdoors” and “blackandwhite” – referring to the picture’s setting and image type.

But the system appears to be misfiring frequently, and often in offensive ways. A portrait taken by Corey Deshon of a black man named William has been auto- tagged with “blackandwhite” and “monochrome” – but also with the words “animal” and “ape”.

The system itself doesn’t appear to be applying race as a factor, since at least one other photo, of a white woman, was also given the “animal” and “ape” tags.

Elsewhere, photos of Dachau concentration camp have been auto-tagged with the “jungle gym”, “sport” and “trellis” tags, while an instantly recognisable photo of the entrance to Auschwitz was given the “sport” tag.

A Flickr spokesperson said: “We are aware of issues with inaccurate auto-tags on Flickr and are working on a fix. While we are very proud of this advanced image-recognition technology, we’re the first to admit there will be mistakes and we are constantly working to improve the experience. If you delete an incorrect tag, our algorithm learns from that mistake and will perform better in the future. The tagging process is completely automated – no human will ever view your photos to tag them”.

The company is already reacting in a piecemeal manner to the mistags, removing the “sport” tag from many concentration camp photos, and apparently removing “ape” from the auto-tagging software’s lexicon entirely (neither of the photos which were tagged “ape” are tagged as such any more, though both still have the “animal” tag).

The tagging mistakes may have been more acceptable to users if the auto-tagging feature was generally popular, but instead, the site’s devoted fan base has been complaining vocally since it was implemented on 7 May. A comment thread about the feature has racked up almost 2,500 replies, the vast majority of them negative.

Users complain that the tags are too broad or inaccurate to be useful, and some have questioned the site’s motivation in introducing the feature. Paul Hetheringon, the Flickr user who brought the offensive errors to the Guardian’s attention, says: “As so often in recent years, Flickr/Yahoo has implemented a significant and radical change in the user experience hastily and without consulting or even warning users. In this case they don’t seem to have considered the possible points of failure, and once again underestimated the anger of the user population at an unwanted change.

“At this point, they need to shut the auto-tagging down and remove all auto-tags from images until they can get the basics right.”

Flickr responded to some user complaints, promising the ability to batch-edit tags, and explaining why the tags are generic. A Flickr staffer posted: “The overwhelming majority of searches on Flickr include some very general terms – sometimes alone and sometimes in conjunction with other, more specific terms. When people search Flickr, general tags often help in getting your photos found.”",,2023-10-23 18:54:31.019890+00:00,True,True,False,,,Flickr faces complaints over 'offensive' auto-tagging for photos - The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36077,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/12/google-acknowledges-its-self-driving-cars-had-11-minor-accidents,2015-05-11 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2015-05-12 00:00:00. Google Inc revealed Monday that its self-driving cars had been in 11 minor traffic accidents since it began experimenting with the technology six years ago.

The company released the number after Associated Press reported that Google had notified the California Department of Motor Vehicles of three collisions involving its self-driving cars since September, when reporting all accidents became a legal requirement of permits for the tests on public roads.

The director of Google’s self-driving car project wrote in a web post that all 11 accidents were minor – “light damage, no injuries” – and happened over 1.7m miles (2.8m km) of tests, including nearly one million miles in self-driving mode.

“Not once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident,” Chris Urmson wrote.

“Cause” is a key word: like Delphi Automotive, a parts supplier which suffered an accident in October with one of its two test cars, Google said it was not at fault.

Delphi sent AP an accident report showing its car was hit, but Google has not made public any records, so both enthusiasts and critics of the emerging technology have only the company’s word on what happened. The motor vehicles department said it could not release details from accident reports.

The lack of transparency troubles critics who want the public to be able to monitor the rollout of a technology that even its developers acknowledge remains imperfect.

John Simpson, privacy project director of the non-profit Consumer Watchdog, said Google’s ultimate goal was a car without a steering wheel or pedals. This could prevent a person from taking over if a car loses control, making it “even more important that the details of any accidents be made public so people know what the heck’s going on”.

Delphi’s accident report showed the front of its 2014 Audi SQ5 had been moderately damaged when it was broadsided by another car while waiting to make a left turn. The car was not in self-driving mode, a company spokeswoman, Kristen Kinley, said.

Five other companies with testing permits told AP they had had no accidents. In all, 48 cars are licensed to test on state roads.

That left Google, which has outfitted 23 Lexus SUVs with driverless technology. It acknowledged “a handful of minor fender-benders, light damage, no injuries, so far caused by human error and inattention”.

On Monday Urmson posted a more complete accounting online, going back to the program’s origins in 2009.

The Google cars have been rear-ended seven times, often when stopped “but also on the freeway”, he wrote. In other collisions, the cars were sideswiped or “hit by a car rolling through a stop sign”. Eight of the 11 collisions were on city streets.

He also described instances in which Google’s cars avoided hitting other cars or cyclists as they drove on streets near the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters.

Nevada, Michigan and Florida have passed laws welcoming tests of self-driving cars on to their roads. Their regulators said they were not aware of any reports.

California’s regulators provided the total – four accidents since September – but would not comment about their nature or severity, citing a longstanding state law making collision reports confidential.

Some details, however, were revealed by a person familiar with these reports: two accidents happened while the cars were in self-driving mode. In the other two, the person required to be behind the wheel was in control.

All four happened when the test car was moving at speeds of less than 10mph (16km/h), said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity for lack of authorization to discuss the reports publicly.

A chief selling point for self-driving cars is safety.

Their cameras, radar and laser sensors provide a far more detailed understanding of their surroundings than humans have. Reaction times should be faster. Cars could be programmed to adjust if they sense a crash coming – move a few feet, tighten seat belts, honk the horn or flash lights at a distracted driver.

The priority so far is not avoiding fender-benders, but teaching them to avoid causing a serious accident that could set back acceptance of the technology for years, said Raj Rajkumar, a pioneer of the technology with Carnegie Mellon University.

The national rate for reported “property-damage-only crashes” is about 0.3 for every 100,000 miles (160,000km) driven, according to the national highway traffic safety administration.

Google’s 11 accidents over 1.7m miles would work out to 0.6 for each 100,000 miles but, as company officials said, as many as five million minor accidents are not reported to authorities each year so it is hard to gauge how typical this is.

“Even when our software and sensors can detect a sticky situation and take action earlier and faster than an alert human driver,” Urmson wrote. “Sometimes we won’t be able to overcome the realities of speed and distance. Sometimes we’ll get hit just waiting for a light to change.",,2023-10-23 18:54:58.623601+00:00,True,True,False,,,Google acknowledges its self-driving cars had 11 minor accidents - The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pennsylvania State University's College of Engineering revealed Friday that it has been the target of two ""highly sophisticated"" cyberattacks over the last two years.

University President Eric Barron issued an apology Friday that said usernames and passwords from more than 18,000 people may have been accessed. However, investigators did not find evidence that credit card and social security numbers were stolen, Barron said. Another statement from the school said a security company hired by the university to investigate the attacks concluded that at least one of the assaults originated from China.

""We all will need to take additional steps to protect ourselves, our identities and our information from a new global wave of cybercrime and cyberespionage,"" Barron said in his statement. ""Well-funded and highly skilled cyber criminals have become brazen in their attacks on a wide range of businesses and government agencies, likely in search of sensitive information and intellectual property.""

This assaults are the latest in a long line of cyberattacks on US universities. Hacks into databases at the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Southern California and the University of Maryland have exposed the personal information of hundreds of thousands of people. Barron said that on average Penn State ""repels"" more than 22 million cyberattacks from around the world every day.

""In this particular case we are dealing with the highest level of sophistication,"" Barron said. ""Unfortunately, we now live in an environment where no computer network can ever be completely, 100 percent secure.""

The FBI first alerted the university of the cyberattack in November 2014. The school then hired security firm FireEye and its cybersecurity forensic unit Mandiant to investigate the breach. It was through this investigation that Penn State discovered at least one of the two attacks was based in China, the university said.

Various security experts have long accused China of waging a cyberwar on US businesses. A report by Mandiant released in 2013 linked China's People's Liberation Army to a large number of cyberattacks on US soil. However, the Chinese government has flatly denied that it is involved in cyberespionage or hacking.

The school has notified about 18,000 individuals that some of their personal information may have been breached -- most notably their Social Security numbers and College of Engineering-issued usernames and passwords. Penn State is offering those people one year of free credit monitoring. The school is also notifying roughly 500 public and private research partners about the breach.

""Advanced cyberattacks like this -- sophisticated, difficult to detect and often linked to international threat actors -- are 'the new normal,'"" said Nick Bennett, Mandiant's senior manager of professional services. ""No company or organization is immune -- the world's leading banks, energy companies, retailers and educational institutions have all been and will be targets.""

While the College of Engineering recovers its systems, it has disconnected its computer network from the Internet. Barron said he believes the network will be back up in several days.",,2023-10-23 19:03:45.426567+00:00,True,True,False,,,Cyberattack on Penn State exposes passwords of 18K people - CNET,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Time flies and crawls, warps and balances, melts and freezes. It passes by before you know it and it stands still forever. All those contradictory kinetic clichés are pulsing away in Elevator Repair Service’s mesmerizing “ The Sound and the Fury ,” which opened on Thursday night at the Public Theater. Adapted from the opening section of  William Faulkner’s 1929 novel  — the chapter titled “April Seventh, 1928” —this sprawling but surreally symmetrical production dares to try to capture onstage one of the most dizzyingly subjective points of view ever committed to print. For the narrator here is a man with the mind of a child, someone who, as another character describes him, has “been 3 years old 30 years.” This man-child’s name is Benjamin, though it was once Maury, and a lot of people call him Benjy. Trying to figure out what Benjy knows has been the bane and delight of countless modern comp-lit students. Many a densely written book has been devoted to Benjy’s way with words, which is a lot less arbitrary than it seems. But as far as I know, Elevator Repair Service is the first theater company to transform everything that’s said, thought and done in “April Seventh, 1928” into a sustained theatrical spectacle. I saw  an earlier version  of this “Sound and the Fury” at the New York Theater Workshop seven years ago. Directed by John Collins, the production has grown bigger and richer in its current incarnation. It is more sprawling than I remember, and may have lost a bit of its hypnotic focus. But it remains as mystifying and enlightening as one of those dreams that seem to explain everything for as long as you’re asleep. The antic but rigorous Elevator Repair Service is fast becoming the thinking theatergoer’s favorite book club, with adaptations of American classics that turn the act of reading into not just acting but action — a dynamic physical process. These include “ The Select (The Sun Also Rises) ,” a riff on Ernest Hemingway’s first major novel, and   “Gatz ,” its extraordinary six-plus-hours, line-for-line rendering of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby.” “The Sound and the Fury” requires a fuller leap of faith — and a more furrowed brow. This is suited to a work of literature that asks readers to become armchair sleuths, extracting a core of shimmering truth from Benjy’s clouded thoughts. This production holds on to the confusion as well as the clarity, with every performer onstage becoming a sort of industrious surrogate detective for us. The whole sorry, decades-spanning history of Benjy’s immediate family — the fast-declining Compson clan of Mississippi — is in evidence in “April Seventh, 1928.” But to unfold that history demands both a close reading and a willingness to go with the flow of a narrative unlike any other. Image Ben Jalosa Williams, left, and Mike Iveson in ""The Sound and the Fury."" Credit... Sara Krulwich/The New York Times Elevator Repair Service pursues this double goal with military discipline and expansive imagination. The production takes place in a large living room that, as designed by David Zinn, exudes a cluttered, well-worn comfort, with its frayed rugs and ornately shaded lamps. At first, it suggests an unchanging place that is fixed unconditionally in memory, in that way we sometimes think of our childhood homes. But everything in an Elevator Repair Service production is subject to flux. And this carefully appointed room will be disrupted, rearranged and thoroughly trashed as we move with Benjy through his memories of the only world he has ever known. The impression is of being somewhere that never changes and yet is always changing. This paradox is given active, vivid life by an ensemble of a dozen who, with lightning costume changes (and occasional dance moves), portray the Compsons and their African-American servants. Conventions of race, age and gender are suspended. Most of the performers play many characters and often take turns portraying a single figure. Susie Sokol, on the other hand, is Benjy throughout (though occasionally Aaron Landsman also takes on the role). As she embodies him, he is an actively passive presence, a person who registers even his own behavior as something happening outside himself. Her face is usually blank, but she twists her body into convolutions to convey her character’s disorientation. It isn’t hard to disorient Benjy: just put him in a moving vehicle or ply him with liquor. The bellows of distress that Benjy regularly gives way to when he feels sad or thwarted come not from Ms. Sokol but, it would seem, from the air. (Matt Tierney did the astonishing sound design, which is matched in tone by Mark Barton’s liquid lighting.) Those wails become a sustained elegy, of sorts, for a familial procession to the graveyard. Different performers read from a battered copy of Faulkner’s novel. Often their voices are neutral, though underlined by the meditative intensity of a reader trying to figure out what’s on the page. But when Tory Vazquez, who plays Benjy’s beloved lost sister, Caddy, at different ages, takes over the narration, you hear the throb of empathy for the bewildered figure at the production’s center. Sentences from the book are sometimes projected onto the walls, as are short biographical descriptions of the characters. If you haven’t read “The Sound and the Fury” (preferably recently), you’re still likely to be at sea. But if you keep your senses wide open, you’ll be aware of patterns forming, the kind that seem to spring up unbidden in your memory, when one chapter of your past suddenly links to another. Every so often the stage is emptied, and there’s not a noise to be heard. Yet you feel somehow that all that sound and fury is still going on, reverberant with the endless echoes you associate with old, abandoned houses. The times portrayed here, after all, never stop happening, not as long as there are readers of Faulkner’s book.",,2023-10-23 19:29:18.279967+00:00,True,False,,,,"Review: 'The Sound and the Fury,' Elevator Repair Service's Take on Faulkner (Published 2015) - The New York Times",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Halo's debut on Xbox One was plagued with issues, as the Master Chief Collection players were subjected to problems that lasted for months after launch. Having gone through that, 343 Industries has vowed never again to launch a Halo game without first running a beta.

Speaking with Game Informer as part of its cover story on Halo 5, 343 head Bonnie Ross discussed the problems MCC experienced. She said that ""the original pitch that we wanted to do was sort of a war chest. Ship all four games separately. Package them up."" But then the idea was broached to put them all together with a single user interface, something that the studio felt was ""a magical experience when you can pull it all together and seamlessly move across games."" Ross added, however, that it was ""very ambitious.""

Noting the challenge of MCC being 343's first game for Xbox One, Ross said offering that kind of experience ""definitely created huge challenges. In hindsight, it would probably have been better to ship the four games separately. And I think that fans would've loved that. We wanted to do more. We wanted it to be this gift to the fans.""

One lesson 343 took away from all of this is the importance of offering a beta.

""There is so much we learned with the Halo 5 beta,"" she said. ""There is actually stuff we took from our Master Chief Collection -- learnings that we were able to put into the beta.

""Going forward, you will never see a Halo game coming out without a beta. It was obviously painful for our fans and for us. But it won't happen again. There are things we put in place to make sure that we know everything, how it stands up outside and in the wild.""

Aside from releasing numerous patches in the hopes of resolving MCC's issues, 343 recently released a remastered version of Halo 3: ODST's campaign as DLC. This was given away for free to those who bought MCC at launch.

We learned some new details about the upcoming Halo 5 today, including the fact that you'll have AI (or co-op) companions throughout the campaign, and that the multiplayer mode will be supported with free maps.",,2023-10-23 20:09:07.537693+00:00,True,True,False,,,"After Halo collection issues, all future Halo games will have betas - CNET",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Walking free: Seth Nolan-Mcdonagh at Southwark Crown Court today were he was sentenced for his prolific criminal hacking

A teenage cyber geek dubbed ‘Narko’ walked free after cyber attacks from his bedroom against global institutions including the BBC that ‘almost broke the internet’.

Seth Nolan-Mcdonagh was just 13 when he joined a network of online hackers who brought websites to their knees using distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks.

The teenager, who netted £70,000 from the scam, dropped out of school and lost touch with ‘the real world’ as he was sucked into the world of hackers.

One attack was launched on Spamhaus, a firm that provides details of spammers to email and network providers, in March 2013.

The attackers then targeted Cloudflare - a service that blocks online assaults - in what was later described as the largest known DDOS ambush by hackers at the time.

Now 18, the young hacker sat in the body of the court between his parents and looked nervously on during his sentencing at Southwark Crown Court today.

Nolan-Mcdonagh had already pleaded guilty to two counts of unauthorised modification of computer material and one count of possessing articles for use in fraud.

He further admitted a charge of transferring criminal property and a charge of possession of 924 indecent photos of children.

Judge Jeffrey Pegden said: ‘Seth Nolan-Mcdonagh you fall to be sentenced for a serious crime committed by you between the beginning of 2011 and April 2013 when you were aged between 13 and 16 years.

‘You are now 18 and a half years of age and you pleaded guilty to these offences in December last year and January this year just before your eighteenth birthday and therefore you fall to be sentenced as a youth.

‘I emphasise at the very outset two matters in particular in respect of your culpability.

‘Firstly your young age when you committed these offences and secondly that at the time you were suffering, as everybody agrees, form a very significant mental illness.’

Nolan-Mcdonagh had also made ‘remarkable’ progress since entering rehab, the judge commented.

‘Those features and others to which I will refer to to make your case, in my judgement, exceptional,’ added Judge Pegden.

‘I said at the outset that these crimes were and are serious and indeed that is so.

‘Your persistent distributed denial-of-service attacking was so sophisticated and unprecedented in scope they had a worldwide effect.

‘As the Times newspaper said at the time they almost broke the internet.’

Nolan-Mcdonagh attacked the BBC, anti-spam site Spamhaus and Cloudflare, among others.

‘Many of those were attacked for financial gain and plain it is to me that you received very significant payments for those attacks.

‘It is impossible to quantify those payments at the moment but suffice for me to note you received over £70,000 in your bank accounts between the ages 13 and 16 years,’ said Judge Pegden.

‘You were in effect a hired DDOS attacker and in effect many billions of domain users and I conclude that you had an instrumental and leading role in the technicalities of those attacks.

‘You caused hundreds of thousands of pounds if loss to the various entities as they sought to mitigate the distributed denials-of-service.

‘But it is right to say that you weren’t alone.

The wrong crowd: Seth Nolan-Mcdonagh was just 13 when he joined a network of online hackers who brought websites to their knees using distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks

‘A number of others were engaged in the attacks and discussed them and no doubt at all encouraged you up until your arrest.

‘Against these very grave matters it is right to emphasise again that you were significantly mentally unwell during that period.

‘You had withdrawn from schooling where you had been bullied and had been hospitalised and most importantly, in my judgement, you greatly withdrew completely from your family and friends,’ he said.

‘You had lost touch with the real world and even your family were unable to help you in the depths of your illness.’

Judge Pegden added there was ‘virtually no risk of any re-offending’ and ‘no risk of future harm to the public’.

‘Of course these offences normally attract a custodial sentence but because of these matters I have emphasised I am not of the view that custody is appropriate in your case,’ he added.

Nolan-Mcdonagh was handed a youth rehabilitation order to be supervised by Lambeth probation services with a six-month supervision order.

He must also carry out 240 hours of unpaid work.

Nolan-Mcdonagh, from Stockwell, southwest London, admitted two counts of unauthorised modification of computer material and one count of possessing articles for use in fraud.",,2023-10-23 21:07:17.318476+00:00,True,True,False,,,Schoolboy hacker Seth Nolan-McDonagh who almost ‘broke the internet’ walks free - Daily Mail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya’s trendy Westgate shopping mall will reopen on Saturday, nearly two years after gunmen from the Somali militant group al Shabaab massacred at least 67 people inside and held out for four days as security forces laid siege to the complex.

Once a totem of Kenya’s growing prosperity, the Westgate building has since become symbolic of growing insecurity in the east African nation and President Uhuru Kenyatta’s inability to prevent frequent Islamist attacks on Kenyan soil.

Images beamed across the world during the raid dented Kenya’s image abroad and scared off tourists, hurting a vital sector of the economy. Kenya’s embarrassment was compounded by Westgate security footage which showed soldiers looting the mall after the Somali militants were killed.

Evans Kidero, the Nairobi governor, said the September 2013 attack was “one of the saddest days in Kenyan history” but touted the re-opening of the mall as a triumph of national resilience in the face of militant attacks.

“They killed... our friends and relatives, but they did not kill our spirit,” he told reporters after touring the building where workmen were slapping on final licks of paint and staff were unfurling promotional banners.

Major Western brands, including Subway, KFC and Converse, plan to open stores in the new mall along with Kenyan companies such as Nakumatt, a high-end supermarket chain popular with well-heeled locals and expatriate workers.

MORE ATTACKS

Al Shabaab has killed more than 400 people on Kenyan soil over the last two years, including 148 in a rampage by masked gunmen at a university in April. Britain and other Western powers have issued several travel advisories warning of more attacks.

But Kidero, like many other Kenyan officials, said security has been stepped up and urged Kenyans to continue shopping in malls as the east African nation was open for business.

“Kenya is safer than ever. If it wasn’t, Obama wouldn’t be coming,” Kidero added, in reference to U.S. President Barack Obama’s visit to his father’s homeland later this month.

I.R.G., a private Israeli company, has been put in charge of running security in the re-opened mall. It has about 25 specialist staff and will use about 55 guards from security firm G4S, one I.R.G employee told Reuters inside Westgate.

New security features will include explosive detectors, luggage X-rays, scanners to check underneath cars, bollards to prevent car bombs, and bullet-proof guard towers.

“This will be the safest mall in the world,” said Cohen, an I.R.G. employee who did not wish to give his full name.

Outside the mall, several young Kenyans were waiting in hope the re-opening will see new jobs created in a country where poverty remains rife and unemployment high.

“Ninety-nine percent of my worries are about security,” said Rosemary Muthoni, a 28-year-old seeking a job at the mall. “But you have to take a chance to survive.”",,2023-10-23 21:14:59.166949+00:00,True,False,,,,"Scarred by Islamist attacks, Kenya set to re-open Westgate mall - Reuters",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Up to one in eight emergencies are missed by the flagship NHS Choices symptom checker website, research suggests.

The study, conducted by experts at Harvard Medical School in the US, casts doubt on the safety of relying on the internet for spotting illnesses.

Health bosses in Britain want the NHS to lead the world through its use of technology and claim it will drive up standards and also save money.

But the new research, which evaluated 23 leading health websites, found that dangerous diseases and health emergencies were often missed on ‘symptom checker’ websites.

A new study has cast doubt over the safety of relying on the internet for diagnosing illnesses. Harvard scientists evaluated 23 leading health websites and found that they only spotted 80 per cent of emergencies

Up to one in eight emergencies were missed by the flagship NHS Choices symptom checker website, the study found. Professor Ateev Mehrotra, said: 'In many cases, users should be cautious and not take the information they receive from online symptom checkers as gospel'

The study, published last night in the British Medical Journal, found that online programs often give patients the wrong advice about what action to take.

To test the symptom checkers, researchers created standardised lists of symptoms from 45 clinical vignettes that are used to teach and test medical students.

They then input those symptoms into 23 different symptom checkers.

Overall, the software algorithms that the researchers studied listed the correct diagnosis first in 34 percent of cases.

The correct diagnosis was included in the top three diagnoses in the list in 51 per cent of cases and in the top 20 in 58 per cent.

In many cases, getting the exact diagnosis may not be as important as getting the correct advice about whether -or how quickly - to go to the doctor.

'It's not nearly as important for a patient with fever, headache, stiff neck and confusion to know whether they have meningitis or encephalitis as it is for them to know that they should get to an ER quickly,' Professor Mehrotra said.

The NHS Choices site was one of the 23 sites from around the globe that the team analysed.

The website, run by the British health service, asks patients a number of questions about their symptoms and then advises them about what action to take - whether it is calling 999, going to A&E, or visiting a GP.

In many cases, users should be cautious and not take the information they receive from online symptom checkers as gospel Professor Ateev Mehrotra

But the Harvard team found that the NHS Choices site correctly identified 87 per cent of emergencies - missing 13 per cent.

Overall the site gave the correct advice in only 52 per cent of cases.

NHS Choices performed better than the other sites assessed - overall the websites picked up just 80 per cent of emergencies.

Professor Ateev Mehrotra, who led the research, warned that internet advice should always be treated with caution.

‘These tools may be useful in patients who are trying to decide whether they should get to a doctor quickly, but in many cases, users should be cautious and not take the information they receive from online symptom checkers as gospel,’ he said.

His team found there was a great deal of variation between checkers, but none were without limitations.

For example, checkers with the most accurate diagnoses (Isabel, iTriage, Mayo Clinic, and Symcat) were not on the list of the programmes that did the best job of recommending the appropriate level of care for a given case (Healthychildren.org, Steps2Care and Symptify).

NHS leaders in Britain are determined to harness the power of the internet, as a cheap way to improve healthcare.

Among the other symptom checkers studied was that by the Mayo Clinic. This site was found to be among the checkers offering the most accurate diagnoses. But researchers said none of the sites were without limitations, for example, though accurate, the Mayo Clinic's tool did not offer the best advise for care

Just this week Professor Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, launched a new digital strategy which will encourage increased use of computer software and mobile phone apps.

He said: ‘The NHS stands on the cusp of a revolution in innovation.

‘At its heart, innovation is the will to better, to find solutions for existing needs or new problems through more effective products, processes, technology or even the way we deliver services.’

And last month the NHS also announced an increased use of web-enabled devices such as Fitbit watches.

Tim Kelsey, National Director for Patients and Information at NHS England, said at the time: ‘The NHS is embracing the offering of digital services to patients, with more than 55 million patients set to benefit from progress.

‘As well as giving patients more choice and control, better use of technology can save money.’

The Harvard experts said that specially-designed health sites are still much better than simply typing symptoms into a search engine such as Google.

But researcher Hannah Semigran said: ‘The tools are not likely to go away.

‘With symptom trackers, we’re looking at the first generation of a new technology.

'It’s important to continue to track their performance to see if they can reach their full potential in helping patients get the right care.’

A spokesman for NHS Choices said: ‘A team of clinicians regularly review the content of the symptom checkers based on clinical evidence and any recommendations from national guidance and update the checker accordingly.",,2023-10-23 21:16:17.290802+00:00,True,True,False,,,Millions of emergencies are MISSED through NHS online symptom checker - Daily Mail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cybersecurity firm Hacking Team appears to have itself been the victim of a hack, with documents that purport to show it sold software to repressive regimes being posted to the company’s own Twitter feed.

The Italy-based company offers security services to law enforcement and national security organisations. It offers legal offensive security services, using malware and vulnerabilities to gain access to target’s networks.

According to the documents, 400GB of which have been published, Hacking Team has also been working with numerous repressive governments – something it has previously explicitly denied doing. It has not been possible to independently verify the veracity of the documents.

The perpetrators of the apparent hack used the company’s own official Twitter feed (renamed “Hacked Team”) to communicate. They continued to post to the feed for hours after, highlighting specific documents they claim come from the hack, such as emails, invoices and even screenshots of Hacking Team employees’ computers, until the company regained control on Monday morning and removed the posts.

One such tweet, which has since been removed, purports to show Hacking Team negotiating with a third-party reseller to export its malware to Nigeria. If the sale took place, it may have bypassed Italian export controls. Another is claimed to show the company debating what to do after an independent investigation from the University of Toronto attacked it for selling hacking tools to Ethiopia, which then used it to target journalists in the US and elsewhere. The company has never publicly confirmed nor denied working with Ethopia, and in March this year a spokesman dismissed earlier reports as “based on some nicely presented suppositions”.

The company has repeatedly denied selling its technology to repressive regimes. In 2013, a Reporters Without Borders report that named Hacking Team as one of the “corporate enemies of the internet” for its position as a “digital mercenary” prompted a response from the firm. In a statement, it said: “Hacking Team goes to great lengths to assure that our software is not sold to governments that are blacklisted by the EU, the USA, Nato and similar international organisations or any ‘repressive’ regime.”

But, if genuine, the leaked documents suggest that among Hacking Team’s clients are the governments and security services of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Russia, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, many of whom have been criticised by international human rights organisations for their aggressive surveillance of citizens, activists and journalists both domestically and overseas.

Most notably, the documents include an invoice for €480,000, which purports to be from the Sudanese national intelligence service, dated June 2012. Three years later, in January 2015, the company told the UN’s Italian representative that it had no current business relations with the country, prompting the follow-up question “as to whether there have any previous business arrangements” with Sudan, the answer to which is not recorded.

A separate document contained in the apparent file dump appears to show Sudan, along with Russia, listed as “not officially supported”, as opposed to the “active” or “expired” status held by most other nation states.

The company describes itself as in the business of “providing tools to police organisations and other government agencies that can prevent crimes or terrorism”, but if the documents are genuine they suggest it may be willing to sell to non-state actors as well. One invoice apparently reveals the company dealing with a private Brazilian firm, YasNiTech, to whom it sold three months access to its remote access tool, allowing the firm to hack in to Android and Blackberry phones, and Windows devices. We do not know if this sale was part of a wider contract with the Brazilian government.

Hacking Team is one of a number of security firms that sell surveillance technology and malware to national governments, enabling them to access the computers of their targets. Gamma International, another firm in the same space that was best known for its FinFisher surveillance software, suffered a similar hack in 2014. In the 40GB of data on FinFisher leaked, the company’s clients, capabilities and pricing was revealed; according to the leaked documents, Hacking Team was celebrating the demise of “a wannabe competitor of ours”. The hacker behind the Gamma International hack has now claimed responsibility for the Hacking Team leak as well, according to Motherboard’s Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai.

Hacking Team refused to give comment over the phone, directing the Guardian to an email address. Multiple emails to that address and others given on the firm’s website were returned as undeliverable, and on a follow-up call, Hacking Team again declined to comment and directed the paper to the broken email address. When the Guardian explained that the email address was not working, Hacking Team declined to give an alternative address or any other form of contact.

Christian Pozzi, one of the firm’s employees, tweeted to say that the documents contained “false lies” about the services the company offers.

“A lot of what the attackers are claiming regarding our company is not true. Please stop spreading false lies about the services we offer,” Pozzi tweeted. “We are currently working closely with the police at the moment. I can’t comment about the recent breach.”

Pozzi’s feed was later itself hacked, and later still the entire account was deleted.

Privacy groups have welcomed a rare chance to potentially look inside the workings of a cyber-surveillance company such as Hacking Team. Privacy International said in a statement: “Yesterday’s leak of materials reportedly shows how Hacking Team assisted some of the world’s most repressive regimes – from Bahrain to Uzbekistan, Ethiopia to Sudan – to spy on their citizens.

“We know from investigations by Citizen Lab that these tools are used to target human rights activists and pro-democracy supporters at home and abroad. Surveillance companies like Hacking Team have shown they are incapable of responsibly regulating themselves, putting profit over ethics, time after time. Since surveillance companies continue to ignore their role in repression, democratic states must step in to halt their damaging business practices.”",,2023-10-23 21:16:36.475656+00:00,True,True,False,,,"Hacking Team hacked: firm sold spying tools to repressive regimes, documents claim - The Guardian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dating site that enables cheating — AshleyMadison.com, which has 37 million users — has experienced some infidelity of its own. Large amounts of data from Avid Life Media, the company that owns Ashley Madison as well as hookup sites Cougar Life and Established Men, have been posted online by a hacker or hackers, as reported by Krebs on Security, a site that monitors hacking worldwide.

It sounds like a high-tech hostage situation. The hackers, self-identified as the Impact Team, said in an online manifesto that they “decided to publish the information in response to alleged lies ALM told its customers about a service that allows members to completely erase their profile information for a $19 fee,” Krebs on Security reported. “According to the hackers, although the ‘full delete’ feature that Ashley Madison advertises promises ‘removal of site usage history and personally identifiable information from the site,’ users’ purchase details — including real name and address — aren’t actually scrubbed.”

The Impact Team is threatening to release customer records — “including profiles with all the customers’ secret sexual fantasies and matching credit card transactions, real names and addresses, and employee documents and emails,” Krebs on Security reported, unless Ashley Madison and Established Men are taken offline.

I imagine that data breaches rank low on customers’ secret fantasies.

Noel Biderman, ALM’s chief executive told Krebs on Security the hacking might’ve been perpetrated by someone who had access to the company’s network, such as a former employee or contractor. ALM released a statement Monday morning, saying the breach is being investigated. “At this time, we have been able to secure our sites, and close the unauthorized access points,” ALM’s statement said. “We are working with law enforcement agencies, which are investigating this criminal act. Any and all parties responsible for this act of cyber-terrorism will be held responsible.”

Whether or not you’re an Ashley Madison user, the breach is a good reminder that, when it comes to affairs of the heart, you probably shouldn’t do anything that you wouldn’t want others to know about. Thinking about arranging a late-night meetup while on a date with someone else? Careful. Your date might catch a glimpse of that text.

Sleeping with with two people while you’re in that not-yet-exclusive dating stage? Hey — you’re not exclusive! But how would you feel if the other people involved knew what you were up to? Doesn’t bother you, fine — go ahead. But if that question makes you bristle, you might want to think twice before you keep swiping right.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange was forced to suspend trading for several hours on Wednesday in the biggest outage to hit a U.S. financial market in nearly two years, unnerving investors already rattled by the meltdown in Chinese stocks and the Greek debt crisis.

The exchange, a unit of Intercontinental Exchange Inc ICE.N, reopened at 3:10 p.m. EDT after being halted shortly after 11:30 a.m. EDT. NYSE said the outage was due to an internal technical issue and not the result of a cyberattack. Other exchanges were trading normally.

“It’s not a good day, and I don’t feel good for our customers who are having to deal with the fallout,” NYSE President Thomas Farley told CNBC during the halt.

NYSE, which traces its roots back to an agreement under a Buttonwood tree on Wall Street in 1792, handled 6.12 percent of U.S. stock volume for the day, with much of that coming after the exchange reopened, according to statistics from BATS Global Markets. That compares to an average of about 13.4 percent last month. (For graphic, see reut.rs/1eGZ8fa)

Traders had awaited the reopening anxiously because much of the NYSE’s business happens when portfolio managers put in orders designed to occur at the exact market close to ensure end-of-day pricing.

However, many traders said that it did not matter that the NYSE was down. That's because there are 11 U.S. stock exchanges, including those run by Nasdaq OMX Group NDAQ.O and BATS, along with more than 40 private stock-trading venues, so the trading of NYSE-listed stocks was uninterrupted.

“This is one of the rare cases where the fragmented markets we live in actually serve a purpose,” said Dave Nadig, director of exchange-traded funds at FactSet Research Systems. “If this happened at (the London Stock Exchange), you would just be sitting staring at a blank screen.”

GLITCHES GALORE

NYSE had been experiencing technical issues even before the market opened. The exchange had said it was experiencing connectivity problems that may have prevented some of its customers from getting acknowledgements on orders submitted in some 220 stocks.

NYSE’s glitch came on the same day that computer problems led United Airlines to ground all its flights for about two hours and the home page of the Wall Street Journal’s website temporarily went down.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said there were no signs that the problems at NYSE and United Airlines stemmed from “malicious activity.” The SEC said on Wednesday that it was closely monitoring the situation at NYSE. The White House said President Barack Obama had been briefed on the matter.

Nearly all U.S. trading is done electronically, and the NYSE outage again raised questions about the robustness of the technology at exchanges after a raft of major glitches in recent years.

A technical problem at NYSE’s Arca exchange in March caused some of the most popular exchange-traded funds to be temporarily unavailable for trading. And in August 2013, trading of all Nasdaq-listed stocks was frozen for three hours, leading U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White to call for a meeting of Wall Street executives to insure “continuous and orderly” functioning of the markets.

The NYSE accounts for more than 60 percent of S&P 500 .SPX volume at the close of the market, according to Credit Suisse analyst Ana Avramovic. Most of this is at the ""market-on-close,"" when those orders are processed for funds and institutions.

“If you don’t have all the orders on that marketplace on the close, the pricing on the close would be definitely not accurate,” said Empire Executions Inc President Peter Costa, who trades on the NYSE floor.

The social network encourages anybody who uploads pictures from their mobile to add their number too.

But if they do, it means anyone can potentially find their name, picture and location simply by typing this number into the search bar.

Underlining the security dangers, a British software engineer has even harvested thousands of data about users, simply by generating random phone numbers.

Scroll down for video

Reza Moaiandin, technical director of Salt.agency, used a coding script to generate every possible number combination in the UK, US and Canada. He then sent millions of numbers to Facebook's app-building program (API) in bulk. In return, he received millions of unobstructed personal profiles

Reza Moaiandin, technical director of Salt.agency, used a coding script to generate every possible number combination in the UK, US and Canada.

He then sent millions of numbers to Facebook's app-building program (API) in bulk. In return, he received millions of unobstructed personal profiles.

Importantly though, the data collected was only data that those users had made publicly available.

There are two relevant privacy settings that apply to this data scrape. Firstly, in the About Me section on a person's profile, they can select which groups of people, from friends to work colleagues, can see their personal data.

HOW CYBER CRIMINALS SELL DATA The cyber criminals’ black market has become even more profitable than the illegal drug trade, according to a report last year by the national security division of RAND Corporation. Pictures, names, phone numbers, education history, and locations can be sold on a network of illegal trading sites, the report found. Typically, hackers sell vast quantities of data in bulk for an astonishing profit. Twitter and Facebook accounts are now more profitable than stolen credit cards, according to the report.

This includes birthdates, relationship statuses, addresses and phone numbers.

It is also possible for users to additionally add a phone number, but set it to be hidden from the search bar - namely in the 'Who can look me up?’ setting under Facebook’s privacy and safety tools tab.

Mr Moaiandin said in a statement to the Mail: 'With this security loophole, a person with the right knowledge can harvest the non-private details of the users who allow public access to their phone numbers, enabling the harvester to then use or sell on the user details for purposes that the user may not be happy with.'

However Facebook told the security researcher: 'We do not consider it a security vulnerability but we do have controls in place to monitor and mitigate abuse.'

In an email to MailOnline, Facebook defended its security settings, insisting users can adjust their privacy settings to stop people searching their information using a phone number.

The spokesman added that developers using the site's APIs are subject to strict rules, and the firm uses 'rate limits' to prevent abuse of APIs, adding that they have taken action against developers who have abused those policies.

However, even developers can't access or see information set as hidden. The problem lies in the fact many users may not be aware that they can change their privacy setting in the 'Who can look me up' menu, and that this is set to Public by default.

In a full statement, the spokesman said: 'The privacy of people who use Facebook is extremely important to us.

'We have industry-leading proprietary network monitoring tools constantly running in order to ensure data security and have strict rules that govern how developers are able to use our APIs to build their products. Developers are only able to access information that people have chosen to make public.

'Everyone who uses Facebook has control of the information they share, this includes the information people include within their profile, and who can see this information.

'Our Privacy Basics tool has a series of helpful guides that explain how people can quickly and easily decide what information they share and who they share it with.'

Cyber security expert Justin Cappos, professor in computer science and engineering at NYU's Polytechnic School of Engineering, said it would be surprising if Facebook took action on the matter.

Reza Moaiandin used a script to find all possible number combinations in the US, the UK and Canada before running them in bulk through Facebook's API to receive millions of profiles. This is a grab from his blog

Unlike Apple, which focuses on building products, Facebook is founded on the idea of freely collating and sharing data.

'Their core mission statement is to allow people to go and disseminate information. So it's not surprising that they haven't responded to this,' Professor Cappos told Daily Mail Online.

'A company like Apple has quite a different perspective on who uses its devices. They are not trying to monetize you, they are trying to make really nice devices.

'If you're providing information to an organization like Facebook, they are making money off sharing that information about you.'

Ultimately, he said, the responsibility will always lie with the user.

'I always say only share things on Facebook that you would post publicly. Imagine a jealous ex-lover going and finding your new number or companies using it for marketing purposes. It is all in the open.'",,2023-10-23 22:29:28.763594+00:00,True,True,False,,,Why you should NEVER put your phone number on Facebook - Daily Mail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you voted  in a Virginia election any time between 2003 and April of this year, your vote was at serious risk of being compromised by hackers. That's the assessment reached by Virginia's board of elections, which recently decertified some 3,000 WINVote touchscreen voting machines after learning about security problems with the systems, including a poorly secured Wi-Fi feature for tallying votes. The problems with the machines are so severe that Jeremy Epstein, a computer scientist with SRI International who tried for years to get them banned, called them the worst voting machines in the country. If the WINVote systems weren't hacked in a past election, he  noted in a recent blog post and during a presentation last week at the USENIX security conference , ""it was only because no one tried."" The decision to decommission the machines, which came after the state spent a decade repeatedly ignoring concerns raised by Epstein and others, is a stark reminder as the nation heads into the 2016 presidential election season that the ongoing problem of voting machine security is still not taken seriously by election officials. Virginia officials only examined the WINVote systems after Governor Terry McAuliffe tried to vote with one during the state's general elections last November. Dismayed at the problems he encountered first hand trying to select a candidate in a Senate race, he demanded an investigation. But even after serious vulnerabilities were then uncovered, some election officials argued against replacing the machines. Richard Herrington, secretary of the Fairfax City Electoral Board, asserted that no voting system was secure. “No matter how much time, money and effort we could put into a device or a system to make it as secure as possible, there is always the possibility that someone else would put in the time, money and effort to exploit that system,"" he  said . Although many of the issues found in the WINVote machines are specific to them, some of the problems are similar to ones found in other voting machine models over the years, all of which demonstrates just how flawed the federal testing and certification process is for approving voting machines used in the US. WINVote Not a Win for Voters The  WINVote touchscreen machines , made by the now-defunct Advanced Voting Solutions when it went by its original name, Shoup Voting Solutions, were used in about 30 counties in Virginia before they were decommissioned this year. The machines were also used in Pennsylvania and Mississippi to a lesser degree, but Pennsylvania  eliminated its systems in 2007 , and Mississippi, which only used them in one county,  replaced them in 2013 . Verified Voting Virginia first began using the WINVote machines in 2003 in Fairfax County, the largest county in the state. Problems with the systems emerged immediately. In a race for the Fairfax School Board, the machines  inexplicably subtracted one vote for every 100 votes cast  (.pdf) in favor of incumbent school-board candidate Rita Thompson, which resulted in a 2 percent reduction in votes for her overall. Thompson lost the race by 1,600 votes. More than 77,000 votes were cast for her countywide, so two percent of the vote was 1,540. Despite this initial problem, other Virginia counties proceeded to purchase WINVote machines over the years, until some 4,000 were in use across the state by 2014. Fairfax County replaced its WINVote machines last year, but about 3,000 remained in use when the state recently banned them. The machines came under particular scrutiny last year after voters in at least 57 jurisdictions complained of various troubles with the machines during the state's general elections. Henrico County, which had nearly 800 WINVote machines, experienced one of the highest number of anomalies with the machines, including ""embedded"" errors, power issues, and unspecified wireless communication issues. Spotsylvania County had the most intriguing problems, however, particularly in precinct 302, at a public library. Voting machines there crashed individually in succession and simultaneously. At one point during the election, all the machines went down. Election staffers  thought the problem was due to a poll worker's smartphone  (.pdf), which was being used to stream music over the library's public Wi-Fi network. The WINVote machines have their own wireless network to upload ballots and to tally votes by aggregating totals from each machine into a single machine after polls close. Poll workers thought the smartphone must have interfered with that network and instructed voters to turn off their phones at the polls. When a county investigator later tried to replicate the problem, he found that his mobile device could in fact connect to the voting machines' wireless network. But although he concluded that wireless interference---unintentional or otherwise---might have caused the problems, he couldn't say so definitively. Virginia State Police opened an inquiry to look into the Spotsylvania issue but found no evidence of criminality and closed the inquiry. The Wi-Fi connection potentially gave hackers a remote vector into the machines. After Gov. McAuliffe experienced a problem with machines in another county and called for an investigation, extensive security problems were uncovered. Two separate examinations were conducted by the Virginia Information Technology Agency and a federally accredited lab known as  Pro V&V  (.pdf). The reports produced were brief but damning. One of the biggest problems they found was that the Wi-Fi connection potentially gave hackers a remote vector into the machines. ""[T]he combination of weak security controls used by the devices would not be able to prevent a malicious third party from modifying the votes recorded by the WINVote devices,"" VITA concluded in its report. The Machines That Time Forgot Although communication between the machines was encrypted, the wireless protocol they used was the notoriously insecure WEP. The FBI had demonstrated in 2005 that it could  crack a 128-bit WEP key in about three minutes . But an attacker wouldn't have needed even this much time to attack Virginia's voting machines. By capturing and analyzing just two minutes of wireless traffic between two machines, investigators were able to crack the encryption key. The key turned out to be ""abcde."" What's more, investigators found that even when they clicked a button to disable the wireless function in an attempt to close them off from remote attack, the device’s network card was still able to send and receive traffic. Once the encryption key was cracked, an attacker could have joined the wireless network to record voting data as it crossed the network, inject malicious data into the stream, or connect to voting machines to subvert them and an election. How so? Investigators discovered that the machines were running on a 2002 version of Windows XP that had not been patched since 2005. A simple scan revealed that the machines were vulnerable to at least 18 known software vulnerabilities, any of which could have provided an opening for attackers to take over the machines. At least one vulnerability was a 10-year-old flaw that Microsoft had long ago fixed but had never been patched on the machines. Time had marched on, but the technology in the WINVote machines had stayed put. ""The WinVote machines were originally certified in 2003. Although this equipment has not changed, the myriad of technological advances in other areas after the original certification have resulted in machines which today, more than a decade later, are less secure than when the machines were originally certified,"" investigators wrote in an early version of their report. The machines also had an administrative account that was secured with the hardcoded password ""admin"". ""Using this account and password, full administrative access to the WINVote operating system was available,"" the investigators  wrote in their report  (.pdf). If an election was hacked any time in the past, we will never know Jeremy Epstein Equally problematic was the Microsoft Access database that stored votes on the machines. Although the database was password-protected, the password was ""shoup""---the former name of the vendor. It took investigators just 18 seconds to crack it using a common hacker tool. The database wasn't encrypted and required no authentication to modify it, so an attacker could have added, deleted or changed votes at will. To test this, investigators ran a mock election, copied the database containing vote tallies to a machine they connected to the Wi-Fi network, then modified the database and loaded it back onto a WINVote machine. ""The compromised vote tallies were reflected in the closed election results, proving that the vote data could be remotely modified,"" they wrote. In total, the vulnerabilities investigators found were so severe and so trivial to exploit, Epstein noted that ""anyone with even a modicum of training could have succeeded"" in hacking them. An attacker wouldn't have needed to be inside a polling place either to subvert an election. ""[W]ithin a few hundred feet (e.g., in the parking lot) is easy,"" he noted. Someone ""within a half mile with a rudimentary antenna built using a Pringles can"" could also have attacked them. Because the systems had no internal logging capabilities to indicate if tampering had occurred, and they also had no paper trail, there was no way to independently audit and verify that the vote tallies in the machine databases were correct. ""[S]o if an election was hacked any time in the past, we will never know,"" wrote Epstein, who lives in Fairfax County and serves as a poll worker during elections. Failure to Heed Warnings Some of the problems with the machines were well known to officials long before the recent examination of them. In fact, Virginia outlawed the use of Wi-Fi with voting machines in 2007, after Epstein pointed out that hackers could use the Wi-Fi connection on WINVote machines to subvert an election. But it turned out that disabling the Wi-Fi on the WINVote machines wasn't an option. The state learned that doing so essentially rendered the machines inoperable. So right before the 2008 presidential election, Virginia officials effectively nullified the ban by  making an exception for voting machines that election districts had already purchased . Since no other certified voting systems in Virginia had Wi-Fi capability, the exception was essentially a carve-out to allow continued use of the WINVote machines. Rather than decertify and decommission the vulnerable machines in 2007, the board allowed their continued use in 30 counties for the next seven years, assuring the public that the systems were nonetheless safe because they employed ""strict security protocols."" Presumably, they were referring to the Wi-Fi network's ""abcde"" password. There was nothing else protecting the machines. The systems have now been replaced in all jurisdictions that were using them, at a cost of about $12,000 per precinct, according to Virginia officials. Questions remain about whether the insecure machines affected any election outcomes in Virginia since 2003. It's difficult to know for certain because only close races get scrutinized. If the margins are wide, candidates tend not to complain, and only candidates and parties can dispute an election result and call for a recount---not voters. The winner of the attorney general's race in 2005 won by just 360 votes. And in 2009 the attorney general race was decided by just a margin of 165 votes out of more than 2.2 million cast. After  a recount , the margin increased to 900. And many found  Republican candidate Eric Cantor's loss  in the 2014 Republican primary  a shock . Cantor had been expected to win with 60 percent of the vote, instead he lost with  just 44 percent of the vote to his challenger's 55 percent . There's no indication that voting machine problems played a role in any of these outcomes, but it's impossible to know without logs or paper trails. ""We don't have any concerns about election results and the accuracy of prior results,"" Edgardo Cortés, the state's commissioner of elections, told WIRED. ""I think there are a lot of checks and balances built into the system"" to guard against fraudulent outcomes. State officials have, however, been pushing local election officials to transition to systems that have paper trails for aiding elections. And he said officials are also looking at how to revamp the certification process to ensure that machines as bad as the WINVote systems aren't certified again. ""One thing we have been looking at overall is how do we, when we certify equipment, account for changing technology? Even though a system may be secure when you first certify it, over time technologies change that may make it less secure."" Epstein says the problems found with the WINVote system likely just scratch the surface. All of the issues uncovered had to do with design, not the internal code, which investigators never got around to examining. ""The vendor … built the foundation out of quicksand. We never looked at what was built on top of that because the quicksand started falling apart so easily,"" he told WIRED. He's convinced that if someone were to examine the source code, it would yield many more problems, like ones that were found previously in  Diebold voting machines  and  others . ""If we actually looked at the software I'm quite sure we would have found as much bad stuff in the software itself as we found in Diebold and any other vendor."" Epstein is the proud recipient of several WINVote machines recently retired by his state. He's offered to provide them to anyone interested in examining the now-defunct machines.",,2023-10-23 22:38:36.441129+00:00,True,True,True,,0.8053301137514968,Virginia Finally Drops America's 'Worst Voting Machines' - WIRED,Virginia's WINVote Touchscreen Voting Machines: Serious Security Risks and Vulnerabilities,"The software failure incident occurred in Virginia between 2003 and April of this year.

39573,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/10/geekie-educational-software-brazil-machine-learning,2016-01-10 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2016-01-10 00:00:00. It’s 10am on a sunny November day in Rio de Janeiro, and the scene inside the classroom is one of quiet application. At a dozen or so hexagonal tables, pupils work on laptops or in exercise books. At one of the clusters, a teacher sits to help a pupil, while another talks to a group of students at the far end of the room – a large salon in which almost half of the pupils at the school are seated. The rest of the school’s 213 students, aged between 11 and 14, are busy elsewhere in the building, which includes six small, more traditional classrooms.

Through the windows that run the length of the classroom, dark blue sea is visible in the distance, past green hills, while above the school Rocinha favela surges up the mountain in a clutter of concrete and peach-coloured brick.

This is André Urani Municipal School, a technology-focused experimental academy at the foot of Rocinha, which with 70,000 inhabitants is Rio de Janeiro’s largest favela. With almost all of its students drawn from the community, André Urani is a flagship adopter of an innovative educational software developed by a São Paulo startup, Geekie. Launched in 2011, Geekie Labs delivers the entire high-school syllabus in hundreds of digital lessons incorporating text, images, videos and exercises, and also evaluates the students’ performance at every step, feeding real-time data to teachers and the school. A separate, widely accessible app, Geekie Games, has the same components, bar the institutional integration.

Geekie’s content and study plans are aimed at equipping students for Brazil’s national ENEM exams, held annually for final-year high-school students and doubling as an entrance exam for many universities, as well as providing proof of achievement for school-leavers.

In the classroom at André Urani, Yago dos Santos Lahas, 14, is taking a history test on Geekie using an HP laptop, one of 220 in the school, which has a five-year sponsorship from companies including Natura cosmetics and Fundação Telefónica. A question – part of Geekie’s bespoke software for the pre-high-school institution – reads: “In world commerce there are rich countries with more purchasing power, and others with less. The search for better commercial relations between those countries, increasing their profits, is called: (a) competition; (b) integration; (c) association; or (d) financing.”

Yago reads the question twice, selecting (a), and a green tick appears. At the end of the 120-minute test, Yago receives his results instantly: 262, displayed beside the average for all students taking the test: 230. How does it feel to see that you are doing better than most? “It’s OK,” he says. “I don’t really think about it. I sometimes do worse than the others, but then you can try again.” The software has machine learning at its core – so the machine, like the students, is also learning, adapting and analysing responses, as more and more data is fed in.

Its pedagogical content is created by a team of teachers and education professionals, also in-house, while the online lessons are given by teachers from private tutorial colleges, who appear in the videos as disembodied voices, speaking over handwritten notes on black backgrounds, and using cursors to emphasise points, or indicate aspects of images. The format of the video segments is inspired by the Khan Academy’s free video classes on YouTube.

In a Geekie biology lesson on the respiratory system, text describing how respiration works is interspersed with exercises and videos. In one video, a teacher speaks engagingly over a diagram showing the transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide inside the lung. “O 2 and CO 2 take opposite routes, but both move by a process of diffusion, OK? OK.” At the end of the lesson, an “In this lesson you saw” page reprises the content as a list of bullet points.

The transmission of content is one of the platform’s main benefits, says André Urani’s headteacher, Marcela de Oliveira. “You simply don’t need a teacher to carry out this part.” Instead of being lectured en masse on subjects in which they may fail to understand a given element, students, she says, do better when they can set their own pace, return to difficult components in their own time and get things wrong without fear of being shown up in front of their classmates. The idea at André Urani, says Oliveira, is that teachers become mentors rather than lecturers, while the children take a more active role in the study process: “They stop being pupils, and become students.”

Beginning with a brief test and a survey on the goal of each user – the purpose of study, and which subject and university, if any, the student is aiming for – Geekie creates study plans, selecting content according to each student’s needs: more economics for aspiring maths candidates, for example. Then, as a student uses the software, it gauges their abilities and presents lessons in personalised sequences, adapted over time as each student’s aptitude evolves, and as the algorithm understands it.

In practice, it’s relatively simple: if a user responds well to certain types of content, it will resurface in similar lessons; and as it gauges students’ performances based on levels of difficulty, it will select lessons pitched at similar levels in other areas of study, too. If a student tends to study best at a particular time of day, the app can send push notifications reminding them what’s next in the study plan. As well as providing structured study plans, Geekie can also, says Claudio Sassaki, who, with Eduardo Bontempo is Geekie’s co-founder and co-director, detect some of the obstacles hindering students. Those might include poor reading comprehension leading to difficulty in understanding maths problems, for example; or missed classes and misunderstood lessons causing knock-on, diagnosable problems later on. Geekie also compiles data to identify, for example, specific areas of knowledge that are prerequisites for more complex subjects, producing material that can be analysed and incorporated by Geekie’s human education professionals.

The more the student uses the software, the more successfully targeted its teaching can become, says Sassaki, and the same is true, he says, of the entire platform: the more students use it, the better it becomes for everyone. “Scale is everything,” he says. Speaking at the company’s São Paulo headquarters, Sassaki explains that operating with as many people as possible using Geekie is essential to capitalise on the exponential properties of the algorithms. “The machine is making correlations all the time, discerning and understanding patterns,” he says. “The more data we have, the better it can do that.”

It’s partly for that reason that Geekie has an unusual buy-one-get-one-free policy: for each licence purchased by a private school, a public school student is given free access. Sassaki says he is someone who has benefited from the transformative effect of education, and got into the business to make a difference. When his grandparents arrived in Brazil from Japan, they became indentured agricultural servants, before escaping to São Paulo. Sassaki earned a degree at the prestigious public University of São Paulo, then an MBA and an MA in Education at Stanford, before going to work on Wall Street where he spent 10 years in finance.

Providing the platform free to some public-school students is partly an altruistic gesture, he says – but also good business. “Brazil is very diverse. It’s crucially important to have information coming in from students all over the country, because they are so completely different. Having that range of data helps to create a product capable of catering for an ever greater number of people.”

Sassaki is quick to note that achieving scale is also a major factor in the company’s reaching its business goals. Finding its way into Brazil’s public-school system is at the heart of Geekie’s ambition. “We want to position ourselves as the default digital platform in Brazilian education,” he says. “I don’t think this a market in which you’ll end up with five platforms like Geekie. There might be one, maybe two, but not multiple. So there’s an element of timing: you either go for it, or you’re not going to make it. And someone else will.”

Geekie made huge strides in its reach in 2013-14, when promotional partnerships with G1, the news portal for Globo, Brazil’s largest media conglomerate, racked up millions of registrations for its Geekie Games app. It has so far reached a total of five million users, it says, with 30% of those adults working towards high-school certificates that they missed out on as teenagers. With a presence in 650 private schools, Geekie is also in use in more than 4,000 public schools, a huge proportion in São Paulo state, where the state government reached an agreement with the company this year to give free access to students in their third and final years, a total of 415,000 students.

“I can focus better with the software than I can using books,” says Otavio Couzenn, 18, a student at Mater Dei, a private school in São Paulo, whose 462 students pay fees of R$33,800 (£6,000) a year – three times the minimum wage – and where many have high-flying parents in politics or the entertainment industry. Mater Dei students use Geekie in an average of three to four classes a week, mainly science, in contrast with André Urani, where the software is used in the classroom from 40-80% of the time.

Couzenn, who is dyslexic, finds the video lessons in Geekie easier to follow than ordinary lessons. “The coloured text helps, and I like that I can go back and forth on a lesson until I’m sure I understand.” Tatiana Kostiuk, also 18, likes the clarity of having the entire syllabus at her fingertips, and Geekie’s straightforward approach: “With textbooks, I sometimes find it hard to work out what I’m being asked to understand,” she says. “Geekie shows you exactly what you need to know.”

Mater Dei’s biology teacher, Aleksej Kozlakowski Jr, reports a 30% improvement in performance on digital tests since Geekie Labs software was introduced in 2015. Kozlakowski is also Geekie’s designated “ambassador” at the school, in charge of incorporating it into lessons for the school’s eldest pupils. According to Sassaki, teacher engagement with the software is crucial. “Students who are interested will use it no matter what,” he says. “The challenge is to get it to students who are not interested.” It takes someone with commitment to help the tool achieve critical mass within a school, he says, and for it to become an integral part of the study process. In some of the public schools in which Geekie is available, he says, it can be difficult for it to gain traction.

Fláudio Azevedo Limas, director of the 196,000-strong State of São Paulo Teachers Union, would agree. Teachers need to be given a chance to get to grips with new technological tools, he says, to be able to use them effectively.

“They can be extremely productive if teachers are included in the process, rather than simply being confronted with the new technology,” he says. There is a danger, he warns, that students can end up simply parked in front of computer screens. “But it doesn’t work that way – they can do that at home. What they need are decently renumerated, properly supported teachers to guide them.”

Professor Glaucia da Silva Brito is research leader for the Technology, Teachers & Schools study group at the Federal University of Paraná, in the city of Curitiba. Research carried out by the group shows strong teacher interest, she says, in incorporating digital tools into their teaching. “But at the moment they are leaving university without any training in the proper use of technology in the classroom.”

In the hallway between classes at André Urani, a handful of students lounge about on beanbags, many absorbed in their phones. “There’s no point in banning phones at school,” says Oliveira. “They’re part of students’ lives, and part of our lives too.” Geekie software is optimised for smartphones, so students who can’t get to school on a given day can work on their phones or tablets, if they have them, even if they have no internet at home. Many André Urani teachers also run Facebook or WhatsApp groups for their students. “They ask a lot of questions on there,” says teacher Luana Rezende, who runs a WhatsApp group for her class.

Just as Geekie’s systems are tailored to students, the platform also provides modules for teachers and school managers, and in the state system can feed performance data to state authorities, too. “The information it gives me is the best part, in terms of management,” says Sueli Cain de Oliveira, academic director for the six private schools that, with Mater Dei, make up the Weducation group. Where Cain de Oliveira previously created her own charts and statistics, Geekie provides them in real time, evaluating the performance of teachers and principals, as well as of students, and allowing her to splice the data in different ways. “I can use it to propose targets for school directors,” she says, “and they can do the same for co-ordinators and for students.”

Is there an issue with privacy, given that data on student – and teacher – aptitude and performance could become widely available within organisations both private and public? It’s information that has always been gathered by organisations in one form or another, says Sassaki. Yet the centralised, easily transmittable nature of electronic data – often cloud-based, unencrypted, and accessed via “bring-your-own” devices belonging to employees – could make it easy for it to find its way into unforeseen places in future, with similar implications for student privacy as those raised for patients by the use of electronic health records.

Sassaki doesn’t appear to have considered it. He looks thoughtful. “That’s true,” he says. “But ultimately, the data belongs to the institutions themselves.”

Despite significant improvements in school attendance rates in the last 20 years – in part as a result of the means-tested Bolsa Família benefit, and before that, Bolsa Escola – only 45% of Brazilian adults aged 25-64 completed high-school, compared to the international average of 75%, according to figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. International rankings, based on maths and science test scores at the age of 15, placed Brazil 60th out of 75 countries in a set of May 2015 results, also published by the OECD.

There remain deep-seated problems in Brazil’s education system, including low levels of competence in the management of many public schools and a lack of accountability, says Sassaki. He says it is also a result of the failure of Brazilian society to demand better education. “It’s a very complex set of problems. Without strong pressure from the population, I doubt many politicians would be prepared to tackle it.”

Yet when May’s OECD report was published, the organisation also released calculations suggesting that, given universal enrolment in high school and the achievement of “basic skills” for all students, Brazil’s GDP could increase by 751% by 2095 – that is, over the lifetimes of today’s 15-year-olds. If those figures are anywhere near the truth, the question becomes how much longer Brazil can afford to fail its schoolchildren. Technological innovations like Geekie seem to indicate that at least part of the solution might be less complicated, expensive and arduous than it once seemed, offering a generation of children new chances to do better.

While recognising the potential, Fláudio Azevedo Limas sounds a note of caution. “Incorporating technology into education is important,” he says, “as long as it isn’t intended to substitute for real teachers.” He points to schools that achieve outstanding results under difficult circumstances with almost no technology: “They could be out in the sertão,” he says, referring to Brazil’s impoverished, north-eastern backlands – but still manage to serve their students better than schools with all the technological solutions in the world.

What students need most of all, says Limas, are well-trained teachers – “and for tech to stay part of the process, rather than becoming the process.”





CAN SOFTWARE TEACH BETTER THAN TEACHERS?



Knewton is an adaptive learning company based in New York. It works with several US schools and has students worldwide

What is adaptive learning?

A highly personalised online learning method that adapts to users’ needs in real time. Software provides feedback that helps learners progress at their own pace. It knows who you are, what you’ve already understood (or not) and decides what you’re going to see next based on your performance.

To plot a student’s most effective learning path, adaptive learning systems also need data about other users’ actions. This allows them to anticipate what types of content and resources learners need at a specific point to progress. In a class using adaptive learning software, each student will be learning the same syllabus, but at their own pace, taking different paths and, in the most advanced systems, using different types of lessons.

Who are the main providers?

Adaptive learning is making waves in the US education system. Knewton, based in New York, is a big provider to schools and claims to have 10 million students worldwide. It also has an office in London. Cambridge University Press, Macmillan, Pearson and ELTjam are its partners.

Aleks (Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces), owned by McGraw-Hill Education, is also used widely in US schools. Facebook is developing adaptive learning software with US schools, while the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has funded research in the area and given grants to US colleges and universities to launch adaptive courses.

Is it being used in UK schools?

Not widely, but interest is growing. Exam board OCR, Cambridge University Press and Raspberry Pi partnered with adaptive learning platform Cogbooks in 2014 to add personalised learning to computing GCSE massive online open course (Mooc). It was used by 20,000 students in 2015.

CogBooks is also working with Cambridge University in 120 UK schools and is hoping to expand this year.

Jim Thompson, CEO of CogBooks

What are its limitations?

It can be expensive to develop and can require schools to invest in technology up front. Classrooms may also need to be restructured.

Adaptive learning systems often use multiple choice questions and some subjects – such as computer science – are obviously much better suited to being taught in this way than others.

Will teachers lose jobs?

Probably not. Jim Thompson, CEO of Cogbooks, says that in the US teachers have found them to be useful tools.

Some systems help teachers track students’ progress in real time, enabling them to spend more time with those who need extra support. Many systems also allow teachers to make their own curriculum.

But there is a long way to go until adaptive learning is standard in schools. Teachers will probably have to be trained in how the systems work to ensure students receive the benefits of adaptive education.

39585,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/18/apple-admits-iphone-6s-and-6s-plus-battery-meters-misleading,2016-01-18 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2016-01-18 00:00:00. Apple has admitted to a bug with its smartphone battery meter that could see the iPhone 6S or iPhone 6S Plus displaying a higher charge than the phone actually has.



The error means that the battery meter fails to update the percentage displayed, leading to some iPhones shutting down while still displaying full charge.

According to Apple, the bug appears when users manually change the time on their iPhones or move between time zones, something a user might do if changing the clock for daylight savings or while travelling.

The company said it was working on a fix, but that in the meantime users should first restart their iPhones, then enable the automatic time setting within the “Date & Time” settings.

The iPhone-maker has a history of bugs linked to its time and date settings. For several years a bug with the smartphone’s automatic daylight savings adjustment broke alarms, leaving some users late for work. Daylight savings was also to blame for a do not disturb bug in 2013, while a bug in the iPhone’s text handling found last year meant anyone could instantly crash the smartphone with an SMS message.

Apple is currently testing a new version of its iOS software that could fix the issue. The iOS 9.3 update, released in public beta to testers, will fix bugs and add a few new features including a night mode that filters out blue light to help users sleep and the ability to pair multiple Apple Watches with a single iPhone.",,2023-10-24 04:05:51.881425+00:00,True,True,True,,0.9580777562590137,Apple admits iPhone 6S and 6S Plus battery meters misleading - The Guardian,,"The software failure incident occurred with Apple's iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus. The failure was related to the battery meter, which failed to update the percentage displayed on the phone. This led to some iPhones shutting down while still showing a full charge. The bug appeared when users manually changed the time on their iPhones or moved between time zones. This could happen when changing the clock for daylight savings or while traveling.

The impact of the failure was that users experienced unexpected shutdowns of their iPhones, even though the battery meter showed a full charge. This could have caused inconvenience and frustration for users who relied on their phones for various tasks.

Apple acknowledged the bug and stated that they were working on a fix. In the meantime, they advised users to restart their iPhones and enable the automatic time setting within the ""Date & Time"" settings.

The responsible entity for the software failure was Apple, as it was their software that had the bug. The impacted entities were the users of iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus who experienced the battery meter issue and unexpected shutdowns.

Apple was testing a new version of its iOS software, iOS 9.3, which was expected to fix the bug. The update included bug fixes and new features, such as a night mode and the ability to pair multiple Apple Watches with a single iPhone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[0.0019427158404141665,

Apple says it is investigating an issue with its iOS software that appears to be preventing the battery percentage icon from accurately updating on the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. The problem has lead some users to believe they have more battery power remaining than they do.

Shortly after the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus were released in September, it emerged that different versions of the phone had varying battery life, depending on which of two chip variations they had inside. Apple admitted that this was possible, but said the difference in battery life was only between 2 percent and 3 percent.

This latest battery issue might be superficially misleading, but it ultimately doesn't affect the total amount of juice you can get out of the phone on one charge.

The problem seems to be closely linked to the iPhone's clock and is in particular affecting users who have recently traveled through several time zones or manually adjusted the time on their device.

""This was happening to me but I figured out it was me changing the system time. It was freezing the battery percentage. Hasn't happened to me since I stopped changing the time/date,"" said Reddit user Sonnyspak.

Apple said it ""is aware of this issue and is investigating the cause and a solution."" In the meantime it advises users affected by the problem to reset their iPhones and then go to Settings > General > Date & Time and ensure that ""Set Automatically"" is turned on.

It's unknown how many users have experienced the problem. Apple usually pushes out fixes to such issues in the next iteration of its iOS software, but the company has not said when we can expect to see this.

Apple did not respond to request for further comment.",,2023-10-24 04:09:41.378286+00:00,True,True,True,,0.8248060389709974,Apple investigating iPhone battery percentage freezing bug - CNET,iPhone 6S Battery Percentage Bug,"The software failure incident occurred with the iOS software on the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. The failure was related to the battery percentage icon not accurately updating, leading users to believe they had more battery power remaining than they actually did. The problem was closely linked to the iPhone's clock and was particularly affecting users who had recently traveled through multiple time zones or manually adjusted the time on their device. The cause of the failure was the system freezing the battery percentage when the time/date was changed. The impact of the failure was that users were receiving misleading information about their remaining battery power. Apple is aware of the issue and is investigating the cause and a solution. In the meantime, affected users are advised to reset their iPhones and ensure that ""Set Automatically"" is turned on in the Date & Time settings. The responsible entity for the failure is Apple, as they are the developers of the iOS software. The impacted entities are the users of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus who experienced the battery percentage issue.

That tiny dongle  plugged into your USB port and paired with your wireless keyboard or mouse isn’t as monogamous as it pretends to be. For millions of cheap peripherals, those innocent-looking radio receivers may be carrying on a sly, long distance relationship---letting an antenna-wielding intruder silently type malicious commands on your PC. That’s a new warning from researchers at the Internet of things security firm Bastille, who released an advisory today that seven different companies’ wireless keyboards and mice are vulnerable to an exploit they’ve dubbed “mousejacking.” The attack---which affects a broad collection of devices sold by Logitech, Dell, Microsoft, HP, Amazon, Gigabyte and Lenovo---lets an interloper inject mouse movements or keystrokes at a rate of a thousand words per minute from an nearby antenna, even when the target device is designed to encrypt and authenticate its communications with a paired computer. “With about fifteen lines of code, you can take over a computer more than a hundred yards away,” says Chris Rouland, Bastille’s CEO, who previously founded the hacking firm Endgame, a US government contractor. In their tests, Rouland and Bastille researcher Marc Newlin used a  $12 Geeetech Crazyradio USB radio dongle  attached to a laptop running their exploit code to pair with the victim devices. They tested as far as that hundred-yard range, though they found that the attack was more reliable with a more powerful  Yagi antenna  and believe it could likely be extended further. They also built a radio-enabled Nintendo controller capable of running their attack software, which they plan to show off at the RSA conference in San Francisco next week. Rouland points out that the exploit, which affects devices that use a little-studied proprietary radio protocol rather than Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, leaves even PCs that have been “airgapped”---isolated from the Internet---vulnerable if someone has plugged in a wireless keyboard dongle. “We can compromise an airgapped network, going in through a different frequency protocol, directly to the USB port,"" he says. How It Works Bastille’s mousejack attack doesn't take advantage of one single vulnerability, but instead a collection of distinct problems in the firmware of wireless devices that use chips sold by the Norwegian firm Nordic Semiconductor. Nordic chips are capable of encryption. But unlike standard Bluetooth chips, the Norwegian firm's cheap, low-power shortrange radio communications chips require that vendors write their own firmware to implement that encryption and secure the connection between computers and peripheral devices. The result, Bastille’s researchers say, is that many of the affected companies failed to take advantage of Nordic's encryption option, allowing the dongles that receive those communications to accept keystrokes from another device using the same radio protocol. Most of the vulnerable keyboards  did  encrypt their communications, the researchers say, but didn't properly authenticate communicating devices; they would still allow another rogue device to inject unencrypted keystrokes over the same connection. “It’s like having an expensive deadbolt and leaving it unlocked,” says Rouland. I don't think people even understand that there’s firmware in the dongle connected to their mouse. Chris Rouland The Bastille researchers claim that “more than a billion” devices are affected in total. They back up that questionable number by pointing to a 2008 press release from Logitech touting the  shipment of its billionth mouse , but couldn't point to a more recent count or one that distinguishes between wireless and wired devices. Given the number of companies whose products Bastille successfully attacked, however, the count of vulnerable mice and keyboards is likely high, possibly in the millions; Rouland says that in Bastille's tests, they were able to spot vulnerable wireless device dongles in most office buildings they targeted with their antennae. ""Once you start looking for that little dongle, you’ll see it everywhere,"" Rouland says. Injecting keystrokes on a target computer, of course, isn't in itself a full compromise of the machine. The hacker would only have the same privileges as the person using the computer and wouldn't necessarily be able to type his or her passwords. Rouland argues that the attack could quickly be used to download malware and take full remote control of a PC. But the computer would have to already be unlocked, a caveat that would likely require the attacker to be able to see his or her target's screen. Bastille What Manufacturers (And You) Can Do When WIRED reached out to the affected vendors, some downplayed the severity of the mousejacking attack. ""The vulnerability would be complex to replicate and would require physical proximity to the target,"" a Logitech spokesperson wrote in a statement. ""It is therefore a difficult and unlikely path of attack."" Lenovo wrote in a statement that the severity of the attack is “low” and claims without explanation that its range would be only 10 meters. Bastille's researchers, who had initially range-tested their attack only on Logitech devices, responded to Lenovo's claim by trying the long-range mousejacking attack on Lenovo devices, too, and say they were able to inject keystrokes from 180 meters away. 1 But Dell, Logitech, Lenovo and Microsoft all acknowledged the vulnerability; Logitech says that with Bastille's help it's developed a firmware update for affected devices. Some Dell wireless keyboards use the same firmware, and the company tells WIRED those keyboards receive the Logitech update, too. Lenovo's statement, on the other hand, admits it can't update its vulnerable devices and instead will offer to replace them for any customer who asks. Microsoft's statement notes only that the company ""will proactively update impacted devices as soon as possible.” Amazon, Gigabyte, and HP have yet to respond to WIRED's request for comment. Now someone has finally taken a look and found that virtually all of (these devices) are vulnerable. That’s pretty scary. Samy Kamkar The Bastille researchers aren't the first to warn of the dangers of wireless keyboards and mice. Early last year, independent hacker Samy Kamkar released the code and specs for  KeySweeper , a fake USB charger that can both eavesdrop on and inject keystrokes from certain Microsoft wireless keyboards. Kamkar's device worked only on unencrypted keyboards, however. Bastille researcher Marc Newlin painstakingly tested this mousejacking attack on many more brands and models of devices. ""It's a bit of a wakeup call when it comes to the implementations of these protocols that are entirely proprietary and that no one has looked at before,"" says Kamkar of Bastille's research. ""Now someone has finally taken a look and found that virtually all of them are vulnerable. That’s pretty scary."" Unlike Kamkar in the case of his KeySweeper attack, however, Bastille has opted not to release its code for fear that mousejacking could be used for malicious purposes against unpatched---or unpatchable---devices. ""This vulnerability will be out for 10 years,"" estimated Rouland. ""When was the last time people updated their router's firmware? I don't think people even understand that there’s firmware in the dongle connected to their mouse."" But even without a public exploit from Bastille, other hackers could soon reverse engineer the attack and release it publicly. That means you should update or replace any vulnerable devices you use ASAP. Or better, says Kamkar, you should switch to more fully tested Bluetooth mice and keyboards. Or the safest fix of all, he suggests: give up on wireless peripherals altogether. ""If you can go wired,"" says Kamkar, ""Go wired."" 1 Updated 2/23/2016 10am EST following Bastille's further testing of their attack on Lenovo devices.",,2023-10-24 05:40:48.853878+00:00,True,True,True,,0.8451696439854446,Flaws in Wireless Mice and Keyboards Let Hackers Type on Your PC - WIRED,Mousejacking: Wireless Keyboards and Mice Vulnerable to Remote Attacks,"The software failure incident, known as ""mousejacking,"" occurred when researchers at the Internet of Things security firm Bastille discovered that seven different companies' wireless keyboards and mice were vulnerable to an exploit. The incident was published on February 23, 2016. The affected companies included Logitech, Dell, Microsoft, HP, Amazon, Gigabyte, and Lenovo. The failure was caused by a collection of distinct problems in the firmware of wireless devices that use chips sold by Nordic Semiconductor. These chips require vendors to write their own firmware to implement encryption and secure the connection between computers and peripheral devices. Many of the affected companies failed to properly implement encryption and authentication, allowing an attacker to inject unencrypted keystrokes over the same connection. The impact of the failure was that an attacker could inject mouse movements or keystrokes at a rate of a thousand words per minute from a nearby antenna, even when the target device was designed to encrypt and authenticate its communications. The responsible entity for the failure was the firmware developers of the affected devices. The impacted entities were the users of the wireless keyboards and mice, as well as potentially airgapped networks if a wireless keyboard dongle was plugged into a computer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[-0.013970564119517803, -0.013970564119517803, 0.0036565186455845833, -0.01967896707355976, -0.02630235254764557, 0.016934016719460487,

Redacción

BBC Mundo

8 febrero 2016

Fuente de la imagen, Thinkstock Pie de foto, El Error 53 deja al teléfono inhabilitado, de forma que ya no se puede acceder a la información interna.

Se llama Error 53 y es implacable.

Aparece tras la última actualización del sistema operativo de Apple, iOS 9, en aquellos iPhone 6 que han pasado por alguna ""reparación no oficial"" y hace que el teléfono ya no vuelva a funcionar.

En verdad, el Error 53 no es nuevo. En una información publicada en el sitio de soporte técnico de Apple actualizada al 21 de diciembre, la compañía explica: ""Cuando iOS encuentra un módulo de Touch ID (el sistema de reconocimiento dactilar del iPhone) que no está identificado o es inesperado, la verificación falla"".

Y se agrega: ""Por ejemplo, un cambio de pantalla no autorizado o defectuoso puede causar un error en la verificación"". En este caso, continúa, se debe contactar al soporte de Apple para conocer ""la información sobre precios para reparaciones fuera de garantía"".

Lo nuevo es que con iOS 9 no importa que el arreglo no oficial tuviera semanas o meses de antigüedad. El software lo detecta y deshabilita al teléfono.

Fuente de la imagen, Getty Pie de foto, Apple informó que el Error 53 es una medida de seguridad para prevenir un sensor de Touch ID fraudulento.

Cuando esto sucede, la información sin copias de seguridad (por ejemplo, fotografías) queda inaccesible.

Hasta el momento, no existe una forma de repararlo ni siquiera en las tiendas oficiales de Apple y se desconoce cuántos usuarios se han visto afectados.

""Una medida de seguridad""

En un comunicado enviado a BBC, Apple informó que el Error 53 es el ""resultado de revisiones de seguridad"".

""Nos tomamos la seguridad de nuestros clientes con mucha seriedad"", decía el comunicado. ""iOS revisa que el sensor de Touch ID en tu iPhone o iPad coincida de forma correcta con otros componentes del dispositivo"".

""Si iOS encuentra un desajuste, la revisión falla y Touch ID, incluyendo la función Apple Pay, es deshabilitado. Esta medida de seguridad es necesaria para proteger tu dispositivo y prevenir el uso fraudulento del sensor de Touch ID"".

De todos modos, el vocero de Apple invitó a los usuarios que recibieron este error a contactarse con el soporte oficial de la compañía.

Sin otra opción

Los motivos por los cuales los usuarios recurren a arreglos no oficiales de Apple se pueden resumir en dos: porque resultan más baratos o porque no existen firmas autorizadas en la región donde viven.

Fuente de la imagen, Getty Pie de foto, En caso de recibir el Error 53, Apple recomienda contactarse con el soporte oficial.

Este último es el caso del fotógrafo Antonio Olmos, quien se considera un adicto a los productos de Apple.

""En setiembre estaba en los Balcanes cubriendo la crisis de los refugiados, cuando se me cayó el teléfono"", le contó Olmos a The Guardian.

""Como lo necesitaba desesperadamente para trabajar, lo mandé a arreglar en un negocio local, dado que en Macedonia no existen tiendas Apple. Repararon la pantalla y el botón de inicio, y funcionó a la perfección."" Hasta que actualizó el software.

""¿Cómo una compañía puede deliberadamente volver inservibles sus propios productos con una actualización y ni siquiera advertir a sus clientes al respecto?"", dijo Olmos.",,2023-10-24 06:08:48.853062+00:00,True,True,False,,,El “Error 53” que amenaza con matar tu iPhone 6 si actualizas el sistema operativo - BBC.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apple customers were targeted by hackers over the weekend in the first campaign against Macintosh computers using a pernicious type of software known as ransomware, researchers with Palo Alto Networks have revealed.



Ransomware, one of the fastest-growing types of cyber threats, encrypts data on infected machines, then typically asks users to pay ransoms in hard-to-trace digital currencies to get an electronic key so they can retrieve their data.

Security experts estimate that ransoms total hundreds of millions of dollars a year from such cyber criminals, who typically target users of Microsoft’s Windows operating system.

Ryan Olson, threat intelligence director at Palo Alto, said the “KeRanger” malware, which appeared on Friday 4 March, was the first functioning ransomware attacking Apple’s Mac computers.

“This is the first one in the wild that is definitely functional, encrypts your files and seeks a ransom,” Olson said in a telephone interview with Reuters.

An Apple representative said the company had taken steps over the weekend to prevent attacks by revoking a digital certificate from a legitimate Apple developer that enabled the rogue software to install on Macs. The representative said he could not immediately provide other details.

The malware is programmed to encrypt files on an infected personal computer three days after the original infection, according to Olson.

That means that if Apple’s steps prove ineffective in neutralising malware that has already infected Macs, the earliest victims will have their files encrypted on Monday, three days after the malicious program first appeared on the Transmission website, he said.

The Transmission site offers the open source software that was infected with the ransomware.

Palo Alto said it planned to release a blog advising Mac users on ways to check to see if they were infected with the virus and steps they can take to protect against it harming their data, Olson said.

Transmission is one of the most popular Mac applications used to download software, videos, music and other data through the BitTorrent peer-to-peer information sharing network, according to Olson.

Representatives with Transmission could not be reached immediately for comment.

Transmission carried a warning on Sunday saying that version 2.90 of its Mac software had been infected with malware.

It advised users to immediately upgrade to version 2.91 of the software, which was available on its website, or delete the malicious one.

It also provided technical information on how users could check to see if they were affected.",,2023-10-24 08:30:43.003760+00:00,True,True,False,,,Apple Macs targeted by KeRanger ransomware for first time - The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42879,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/2017-iphone-glass-body-aluminum-ming-chi-kuo-samsung/,2016-04-18 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnet.com,,"Published on None. Next year's iPhone may sport an all-glass body.

The 2017 iPhone will dump its traditional aluminum casing, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Sunday in an investors note picked up by Apple blogs 9to5Mac and AppleInsider. Instead, the phone will have a glass chassis.

The reason for the material switch, according to Kuo, is both to differentiate the iPhone from rival phones that use aluminum and to boost stagnant sales.

Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. KGI didn't respond to a request for a copy of Kuo's report. In the past, KGI has said regulations prevent it from distributing its research in the US.

iPhone sales growth has flattened, in part because customers resisted upgrading after last year's 6S and 6S Plus failed to include enough new features. Equipping future phones with more must-haves could help Apple put some pep in sales and compete with Samsung, as well as other phone makers.

Glass would certainly add to the premium look and feel that Apple has historically given its products. It also offers advantages for wireless charging and antenna reception, according to Forbes.

Of course, glass has one major -- and obvious -- disadvantage. It's more fragile than aluminum.

Apple used glass on the back of iPhone 4 and 4S, which led to incidents of shattered backs.

The glass expected to be used in next year's iPhone will be tougher and more durable than the glass used in the past, Kuo said, according to AppleInsider. So the new phone's casing would stand a better chance of surviving a drop.

Glass is also heavier than aluminum. But that won't be a problem, according to the analyst, because Apple will switch from traditional LED displays to AMOLED screens, which are thinner and lighter.

One drawback in Kuo's forecast is that the glass casing and AMOLED screen won't show up until 2017, rather than in Apple's expected iPhone refresh later this year. Reports so far of the coming iPhone indicate few enhancements from the current model beyond stereo speakers and a dual-camera for the larger model. Such a scenario could disappoint consumers and investors alike.

All of this remains in the rumor stage. That said, Kuo has a good track record at nailing Apple developments.",,2023-10-24 21:28:40.909547+00:00,True,False,,,,"2017 iPhone will replace aluminum body with glass, says analyst - CNET",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTC showed off a new phone Tuesday that it hopes will help it break out from the pack of Android smartphones on the market. The HTC 10, named to honor the number of years the Taiwanese company has made its own branded smartphones, is a 5.2-inch premium phone with a focus on high-end audio and camera features.

It's been interesting to watch HTC's product strategy over the past couple of years. As Apple and Samsung have eaten up the majority of market share and mind share, the firm has tried to find its niche by focusing its product line more tightly — putting its effort into very few products, such as a premium smartphone and its recently released virtual-reality headset. So how does the HTC 10 stack up to the competition? A full opinion will follow once review units are sent out, but HTC's announcement gives us the basics.

Distinguishing features: The main distinct selling points for the HTC 10 are its speakers and camera. HTC has a long history of thinking carefully about audio on its phones — it used to have a partnership with Beats back in the day. The company has put a front-facing tweeter and a bottom-facing woofer on the phone to give the sound a greater depth. It also says it has improved the quality of its headphone sound, promising to ""pump out richer sound across twice the frequency range.""

The firm is also heavily promoting its advanced 12 megapixel camera, bragging that it ""may well be the best smartphone camera available today."" That claim will have to hold up to some scrutiny, but the firm has included image-stabilizing software on both the rear- and front-facing cameras, for better traditional photos and better selfies. HTC also boasts that its camera does well in low light and can shoot 4K video.

Hardware: The 5.2-inch smartphone has the same high-end processor found in competitors, such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, and 4 GB of RAM. It also comes with 32 GB of storage and supports expandable memory up to 2 TB. The company is touting the phone's battery life, promising that the HTC 10 will be able to last for at least two days on a single charge.

In terms of its screen, HTC is using what it calls a ""Super LED"" screen covered in tough Gorilla Glass, promising a display that will show off photos and videos with flair. It also has a fingerprint reader.

Hardware design has always been a strong point for HTC, and the company seems to have returned to form with this latest model, which has more in common with the look of its HTC One and HTC One M8 models, rather than the iPhone-like touches of its immediate predecessor, the M9. The metal-bodied phone comes only in silver and dark gray — not the rose gold or gold options of its competitors — but its attractive curved back and slanting edges give it a pretty unique profile.

Software: The HTC 10 will ship with Android Marshmallow, Google's latest operating system, and has taken pains to cut down on app bloat by preinstalling fewer apps. The layout is designed to be more customizable, meaning that users can choose their own icons and place them where they wish. Rather than the traditional grid, HTC said in a news release, ""instead you can get creative by dragging icons, stickers and widgets anywhere you like. Layer them, group them, link stickers to apps or get rid of screen icons altogether, the choice is yours.""

A hands-on article from PC World notes that HTC has ditched its own calendar app in favor of Google's and doesn't have its own Gallery app. Instead, it uses Google Photos. While some of the duplicate apps have been eliminated, the article said, there are still some duplicate apps, such as for text messaging.

Price: The HTC 10 has a recommended price of $699; pricing plans at carriers may vary. Preorders start Tuesday, and the phone will be on shelves in early May, the company says.",,2023-10-24 21:49:25.137878+00:00,True,False,,,,HTC 10: The basics you need to know about HTC's new phone - The Washington Post,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carmaker Toyota and its luxury brand Lexus rushed to fix a software bug Wednesday that had caused a malfunction in vehicles’ GPS, climate control and “infotainment,” or front console radio systems. It disabled the hands-free phone functions as well. Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight The company originally said the backup camera was downed by the glitch, but Thursday said it determined it was unaffected.

Errant data broadcast Tuesday by the company’s traffic and weather service confounded vehicles' ""Enform"" infotainment system installed in 2014, 2015 and 2016 Lexus vehicles and the 2016 Toyota Land Cruiser, the company said. The data made the subscription-based “Enform” system continuously reboot itself, rendering it unusable and drawing the ire and of many a driver.

Lexus’s social media accounts were flooded with complaints through Wednesday morning and by 9 a.m., the company told customers to stand by for a momentary fix.

#Lexus sucks. nationwide screen blackout in all cars bcuz of satellite and won't give loaners to fix it? #badbusiness — Dori Zuckerman (@dorizuckerman) June 8, 2016

Later in the afternoon it apologized for any inconvenience caused to customers and offered a fix for the bug.

Owners should force a reset of their vehicle’s computer by disconnecting its 12-volt battery for at least 5 minutes, the company said. Owners can also bring their vehicles to a Lexus dealer to reset their system.

The company halted the offending data stream overnight, but did not anticipate lingering problems in its vehicles. Lexus said it is still determining how many vehicles the bug impacted.

The same way smartphone or software companies remotely update their products, car companies are increasingly doing the same to fix operating system glitches and even update road maps and car-friendly mobile applications.

That’s because cars are increasingly becoming giant rolling computers, capable of doing an untold number of tasks while getting from Point A to Point B. Consider the“Enform” service, which includes smartphone and app connectivity, SiriusXM satellite radio, traffic and weather updates and Bluetooth connectivity.

A new car might have 100 million lines of code, according to a report by research and accounting firm Stout Risius Ross. The more luxurious the car, the more interconnected its technological components may be.

Over-the-air updates are becoming more common and are advantageous because instead of asking drivers to return their vehicles to dealerships for quick technological tweaks, carmakers route software updates remotely. A 2015 report from research firm IHS Automotive predicted carmakers would save $35 billion in labor and parts by 2022 in over-the-air software updates.

""If you look at any industry that’s done this before — phones, smart TVs — they’ve all gone through this same thing,"" said Colin Bird, a senior automotive technology analyst at IHS. ""I don’t view it as much of a setback.""

Every now and then, a faulty update or bad data may cause electronics to go on the fritz. On Wednesday, it was a luxury car brand, the same one Consumer Report’s annual auto survey found most reliable in 2015.

“You run into this problem, and frankly, stuff like this even on my phone happens once in awhile,” said Neil Steinkamp, managing director at Stout Risius Ross. “The rub here is that it happens on your car.”

Company spokesman Moe Durand said most of the glitches had been taken care of.

He called the bug, “easily remedied.”",,2023-10-25 18:40:47.651200+00:00,True,True,True,,0.8728548512973751,Why everyone should worry about this scary glitch that affected rich drivers - The Washington Post,Lexus Software Bug Causes Malfunction in GPS and Infotainment Systems,"The software failure incident occurred on Tuesday when a software bug caused a malfunction in the GPS, climate control, infotainment, and hands-free phone functions of Toyota and Lexus vehicles. The glitch was caused by errant data broadcasted by the company's traffic and weather service, which affected the Enform infotainment system installed in certain Lexus vehicles and the Toyota Land Cruiser. The bug made the Enform system continuously reboot itself, rendering it unusable. The incident drew complaints from customers, flooding Lexus's social media accounts. The company apologized for the inconvenience and offered a fix for the bug, which involved resetting the vehicle's computer by disconnecting the 12-volt battery for at least 5 minutes or bringing the vehicle to a Lexus dealer for a system reset. The responsible entity for the software failure was Toyota and Lexus. The impacted entities were the owners of the affected vehicles. The company halted the offending data stream and is still determining the number of vehicles impacted by the bug. The incident highlighted the increasing reliance on software in cars and the use of over-the-air updates to fix glitches and update systems

You should be  able to trust your wireless keyboard. And yet security researchers have been warning people to be suspicious of wireless computer accessories using sketchy radio protocols for years. Those warnings peaked five months ago, when  hackers at the security firm Bastille found that millions of cheap keyboard and mouse dongles let hackers inject keystrokes  onto your machine from hundreds of yards away. Now, in case you missed that message, the same researchers have extended their attack to millions more devices---and this time, they can not only inject keystrokes, but also read yours, too. On Tuesday Bastille’s research team revealed a new set of wireless keyboard attacks they’re calling Keysniffer. The technique, which they’re planning to detail at the Defcon hacker conference in two weeks, allows any hacker with a $12 radio device to intercept the connection between any of eight wireless keyboards and a computer from 250 feet away> What's more, it gives the hacker the ability to both type keystrokes on the victim machine and silently record the target’s typing. The keyboards' vulnerability, according to Bastille’s chief research officer Ivan O’Sullivan, comes from the fact that they all transmit keystrokes entirely without encryption. The manufacturers' only plan against attackers spoofing or eavesdropping on their devices’ communications is to depend on the obscurity of the radio protocols used. “We were stunned,” says O’Sullivan. “We had no expectation that in 2016 these companies would be selling keyboards with no encryption.” In a  detailed website Bastille created  to document their attack and the vulnerabilities it exploited, they list keyboards from HP, Toshiba, Radio Shack, Kensington, Insignia, General Electric, Anker and EagleTec as vulnerable to Keysniffer. Instead of connecting to computers via Bluetooth, which is standardized and has undergone extensive security testing, all of these devices use one generic alternative or another. Six of them use transceiver chips from a company called Mozart Semiconductor, and the other two use their own non-Bluetooth chipsets. Bastille's researchers say going generic saves manufacturers money, but also means devices don't get the better-tested encryption built into the Bluetooth standard. The only reason these devices had been operating under the radar is because no one had taken the time to reverse engineer them. Bastille researcher Marc Newlin In this case, the generic connections seem to have left the devices with virtually no real security at all. After a few weeks of painstaking reverse engineering work with a software-defined radio---an increasingly common tool for hackers exploring obscure radio frequencies---Bastille researcher Marc Newlin was able to recognize and reproduce any keystroke sent by the keyboards based on their radio signals alone. ""There were no specifications,"" says Newlin. ""The only reason these devices had been operating under the radar is because no one had taken the time to reverse engineer them."" Newlin also rewrote the firmware of a $12 Geeetech Crazyradio dongle to speak the obscure keyboard protocols he'd analyzed. With that plugged into a laptop, Newlin can, from hundreds of feet away, read or write keystrokes to any computer connected to one a vulnerable keyboards. He estimates he could increase that range with a Yagi antenna. Earlier this year, Newlin used that same setup to demonstrate an attack Bastille called Mousejack. Mousajack affected a broad collection of other wireless keyboards and mice, and was based on Newlin's discovery that many of the USB dongles those devices connected to were mistakenly programmed to accept unencrypted keystrokes if a hacker sent them, allowing an interloper to type on---but not actually read keystrokes from---your machine. But with Mousejack, you'd know when you were being hacked. Keysniffer's invisible eavesdropping on keystrokes represents a far stealthier attack. Keysniffer isn't the first keyboard-eavesdropping technique of its kind. As early as 2009 researchers broke the weak encryption of Microsoft wireless keyboards to  create a keyboard-sniffing tool called KeyKeriki . And last year hacker Samy Kamkar demonstrated the vulnerability of Microsoft's wireless keyboards again: He released code and specs for an  Arduino-based tool called KeySweeper  that plugs into a power outlet, impersonates a cell-phone charger, and both injects and sniffs keystrokes. The FBI went so far as to post a public advisory to be on the lookout for those KeySweeper spy devices, but  hasn't confirmed if any such attacks have actually hit businesses or government agencies . Bastille's work goes a step further than those Microsoft keyboard attacks. First, it shows that far more than a single manufacturer is vulnerable to the wireless keyboard radio hacks. And Newlin points out that unlike Microsoft's target keyboards, the eight he analyzed all transmit information from their USB dongles at all times, waiting for a keyboard to respond to their communications. The Microsoft keyboards KeySweeper attacked, by contrast, only transmit at certain moments, like when someone starts typing. That means a hacker looking for targets could simply point an antenna at an office building and pick up radio signals from any of the hackable keyboards in it. ""The fact that these keyboards are 'louder' makes the problem even worse,"" says Kamkar. When WIRED reached out to the affected manufacturers, EagleTec said it was still looking into Bastille's research. Insignia denied that any of its keyboards lacked encryption, contradicting Bastille's findings---though Bastille says it rechecked its test against Insignia's keyboards and was able to successfully repeat the attack. Most of the companies didn't respond to WIRED's request for comment. Only Jasco, the company that makes the vulnerable GE keyboard, admitted to the problem and said it ""will work directly with...customers of this product to address any issues or concerns,"" asking that owners of the vulnerable keyboards  contact its customer support . But Bastille says that there's no easy fix for the vulnerabilities it's found, since the wireless devices don't have a mechanism to push out a patch. Instead, the company is advising that anyone who owns one of the hackable devices switch to a wired keyboard, or at least one that uses actual Bluetooth. For the security savvy, that's not a new piece of advice; the work of researchers like Kamkar and the KeyKeriki developers should have put manufacturers of non-bluetooth wireless peripherals on notice years ago. But Kamkar says the breadth of the KeySniffer research makes that lesson clearer than ever. ""They’re demonstrating that more vendors aren’t doing this right, and this is the most critical input device we have on a computer,"" Kamkar says, ""If they can sniff and inject, it's game over.""",,2023-10-25 21:32:27.089252+00:00,True,True,True,,0.9369488919325188,Radio Hack Steals Keystrokes from Millions of Wireless Keyboards - WIRED,,"The software failure incident occurred when security researchers at Bastille discovered a vulnerability in wireless keyboards.

Are you plagued with nuisance calls, possibly from fraudsters? Do you worry that an elderly parent or relative might be conned into parting with their cash by scam callers? A new phone company is promising to bring back old-style operators, who will screen out scammers and unexpected sales calls.

The service, called Fuss Free Phones, will cost users £20 a month, and is largely aimed at the elderly who live alone, and those who struggle with poor health or eyesight. If a call comes from someone who is on a “trusted callers list” then it is put through. But any call from an unknown number is answered by the receptionist. Scammers are sent packing, PPI calls are banished and “Microsoft” engineers wanting access to your computer are barred.

Receptionists unsure whether to connect a call will call the subscriber’s designated person who will decide whether to pass it on or not.

Users will have to buy a special handset costing £80 to access the service, which is designed to look very similar to a standard home phone, with large keys designed for people with bad eyesight, and uses the O2 network.

With elderly people receiving an average of 39 nuisance calls a month – 50% more than the general population – the service claims it will put a stop to the problem immediately. Scammers have increasingly targeted older people because they can often be confused or more easily duped. Last week Guardian Money ran a story of a couple in their 80s who lost £134,000 after being phoned at home by bank fraudsters.

Customers have to give the firm a list of the numbers of friends, relatives and organisations that are likely to call them. These numbers are then programmed into its system, using software originally developed to protect undercover police and murder case witnesses.

If customers want to make a call, they simply pick up the receiver, press the button and ask the operator to put them through. Alternatively, the user can ask the telephonist to find information on the internet or even to book a taxi.

Simon Rockman, founder of Fuss Free Phones says the service, which has been endorsed by a number of charities including RNIB, will answer 80% of calls within 20 seconds. He is working on a landline version, but says technical issues mean it’s a year away.

Another popular service used to screen out unwanted calls is the trueCall Call Blocker, which promises to screen out 95% of nuisance calls. It works on landlines and costs £100, with no monthly fee after that.

The Telephone Preference Service allows you to opt out of unsolicited sales and marketing calls, but critics say it is widely circumnavigated by scammers.",,2023-10-26 00:33:16.200350+00:00,True,False,,,,New phone service aims to protect elderly from nuisance calls and scams - The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47712,https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2016/sep/30/has-a-software-bug-really-called-decades-of-brain-imaging-research-into-question,2016-09-30 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2016-09-30 00:00:00. Since its inception in 1990, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has revolutionised the way we think about the brain. In association with other techniques, it provides invaluable clues to understand brain disorders, like psychosis or dementia. At its heart, fMRI is a medical imaging technique that allows scientists to look at where oxygenated blood is being directed around the brain – if a brain area is being used for a particular task, it will need more oxygen. So by extension, fMRI allows us to look at how information is processed in the brain, and is one of the few techniques we have to look directly into a person’s brain while they are thinking.

However, this past summer has seen a series of alarmist headlines about the technique cropping up in the media. There have been claims that ‘Tens of Thousands of fmri brain studies may be flawed’, and that a ‘bug in fMRI software calls 15 years of research into question’ (also here, and up to 20 years here), and even that fMRI as no scientific value (‘the great brain scan scandal’) or that much of what we know about the brain may be wrong. But is fMRI research really in such a sorry state?

The furor finds its origins in a study in the July issue of the Proceeding of the National Academy of Science by Anders Eklund, Thomas Nichols and Hans Knutsson. Despite being in use for some 25 years, some of the most common statistical analyses used on fMRI data haven’t been fully assessed for accuracy. To address this, Eklund and his team set out to measure the false positive rates of standard task fMRI methods. A false positive is when we wrongly conclude an effect is present, when in reality there is no effect. A pregnancy test that comes out positive when the woman is not pregnant is one example of this type of error. When it comes to fMRI data, a false positive could be that an area of the brain is declared activated by a task, when in reality it is not. Eklund’s work is essential because it allows us to ascertain the scientific validity of fMRI – in other words, how much we can be sure that we’re measured what we think we’re measuring.

Once signals from the MRI machine are recorded, many analysis steps take place and ‘maps’ of activation can be created, showing which areas of the brain are in use, and which are not. Given the complexity of the method, it is impossible to completely eliminate false positives from these maps, so researchers use statistical tests that try to control errors to a desired (usual small) rate. The key finding from the PNAS paper is that, one method typically used in fMRI analysis can give a much higher false positive rate than expected – in some cases, a chance of up to 70% that the software might produce a false positive when 5% was expected.

This might sound disastrous, but it’s not actually completely new. As Neuroskeptic has pointed out, this study is the culmination of work that has been going on for a number of years, with the novel contribution here being that Eklund’s team illustrated the problem empirically, based on openly available data, identified the origin of the problems, and provided an alternative solution to standard methods.

So what can we really conclude from the study? First, it is not true that tens of thousands of studies are affected. Not all fMRI studies use the methods called into question. As pointed out on one of the author’s blog, around 3500 studies (or less than 10% of existing fMRI studies) used the method called into question. It is equally important to note that this also does not mean the discoveries from all 3500 of these studies are false; the effects in some studies could be so strong to be detected even despite this problem, or the findings in others could be weak but have subsequently been replicated. Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing the status of each of these studies, as data from published studies was not shared or archived for reanalysis.

Another headline claim was that 15 years of research are called into question because of a bug. The bug reported in the paper concerns an error in one piece of software (AFNI, the least used of the three tested) leading to higher error rates than expected (this bug was fixed in 2015). As the authors note, this bug contributed to inflated false positive rates, but is only a small factor relative to the problems common to all three software packages.

In short, for those who see these problems as the death knell for fMRI, they are simply missing the point of this line of work - which is to make the science more robust. When controversial issues like these have arisen in the past, far from throwing the baby out with the bath water, the scientific community has instead responded strongly and raised standards. There is no doubt this is going to be the same this time around.

Critical to the success of the 911 emergency phone system, which has saved countless lives since it was first implemented in 1968, is its ability to quickly route calls to emergency responders closest to a caller. Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight But a group of researchers say they’ve found a way to effectively disable the 911 emergency system across an entire state for an extended period of time by simply launching what’s known as a TDoS attack, or telephony denial-of-service attack, against 911 call centers. The tactic involves infecting mobile phones to cause them to automatically make bogus 911 calls — without their owners' knowledge — thereby clogging call-center queues and preventing legitimate callers from reaching operators.

The researchers say it would take just 6,000 infected smartphones in a geographical area — something hackers could easily accomplish — to launch an attack sufficient to disrupt the 911 system throughout the entire state of North Carolina, and just 200,000 infected phones distributed across the U.S. to significantly disrupt 911 services around the nation.

“Under these circumstances, an attacker can cause 33 percent of the nation's legitimate callers to give up in reaching 911,” the researchers at Ben Gurion University in Israel wrote in a paper they recently passed to the Department of Homeland Security and are releasing publicly today.

Because call centers and routers around the country often operate at near capacity under normal conditions, increasing the volume of calls by just a small percentage can overwhelm them, said Mordechai Guri, head of R&D at the university's Cyber Security Center and chief scientist at Morphisec Endpoint Security. Guri conducted the work with researcher Yisroel Mirsky and Professor Yuval Elovici, head of the center.

""We believe the researchers have accurately characterized the problem"" with the 911 system, said Trey Forgety, director of government affairs for the National Emergency Number Association, who received a copy of the researchers' paper from DHS. He says his group has long been aware of the potential for a TDoS attack and brought it to the attention of DHS four years ago. ""We actually believe that the vulnerability is in fact worse than [the researchers] have calculated.""

The call capacity of 911 systems is exceptionally limited, and in many cases just three to five circuits process all 911 calls for a 911 center, Forgety said. ""Three to five circuits is trivial to overwhelm. I can do it with a pocketful of cellphones.""

The federal government considers the 911 system to be part of the nation's critical infrastructure on par with the power grid, water treatment plants and dams. Americans make more than 240 million calls annually to more than 7,000 call centers scattered across the country. About 70 percent of these calls now come from mobile phones. But the technology used to process these calls hasn't kept pace with security needs, experts say.

An attack could be prolonged for days using techniques that would prevent authorities from halting the bogus calls, Guri and his colleagues say. The problem would be exacerbated as legitimate callers trying to get through made repeated calls that further clogged the lines.

Denial-of-service attacks against 911 systems have been discussed as a concept at hacker conferences for years, although it's not known if any 911 outage has ever been caused by a TDoS attack. But in 2013, something occurred that indicated that attackers have 911 call centers in their sights. DHS and the FBI issued a warning to states about several TDoS attacks that had been launched against the administrative lines of various 911 call centers. Although these attacks didn’t target the 911 emergency lines themselves, they demonstrated the potential danger from TDoS attacks against the 911 system. The perpetrators launched the attacks as part of an extortion plot — after first demanding money and being turned down, they “launched high volume of calls against the target network, tying up the system from receiving legitimate calls,” according to the DHS alert.

How an attack works

The 911 call centers don’t run on a single, unified network; instead each state operates its own facilities, often managed at the county level, with calls being directed to centers by telecom providers or third-party companies contracted by telecoms.

When a caller dials 911, the call gets sent to a network dedicated to processing emergency calls. A router first determines the caller's location by consulting an address database if the call is coming from a landline. If it's a mobile call, the router determines the location based on coordinates sent from the mobile phone’s GPS chip or from the cellphone tower that picks up the call. Based on the caller's location, the router sends the call to the nearest Public Safety Answering Point where operators dispatch appropriate responders — fire, police, or ambulance.

To disrupt a 911 network, an attacker could infect mobile phones to create a botnet of phones — which is a network of computers or phones infected with the same malware that allows a hacker to control the devices. The attacker can infect phones either by sending malware to them as an email attachment or text message or embedding malicious code in an application that users are enticed to download and install on their phone.

How easy is it to infect a mobile phone through an app? Last year, researchers discovered malware for the iPhone operating system embedded in popular consumer apps distributed through Apple's App Store. And in 2011, a survey of Android apps distributed through Google's Play store found more than 10,000 apps contained malware or spyware of one sort or another.

Malware that the researchers created for their TDoS test infects the phone’s firmware — software beneath the operating system that makes the phone work. The attacker then sends a command to infected phones over the Internet or via covert text messages to call 911 repeatedly. Because the calls are initiated by the firmware and not the operating system, they occur silently in the background without the phone owner’s notice. No record of the calls appears in the phone’s call log either.

A carrier or 911 system could theoretically halt an attack by blacklisting phones that make repeated 911 calls, either by blocking the phones based on the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number stored in the phone’s SIM card or the unique International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number assigned to every mobile phone during manufacturing. But the malware the researchers created causes the phones to send random IDs to cell towers instead, changing the IDs with each call the phone makes to thwart blacklisting.

Theoretically, changing the IMSI with a random one should cause a mobile phone carrier to drop the call once it recognizes that the IMSI does not belong to a legitimate subscriber. But FCC regulations require carriers to process every 911 call that comes through their cell towers, regardless of whether the call is made by a subscriber. This is because many legitimate 911 calls come from phones that are not currently on a carrier service plan. Domestic violence shelters and retirement centers, for example, often provide non-service phones to battered women so they can make emergency calls.

The Carolina test

To test their TDoS attack, the Israeli researchers built a simulated cellular network in their lab based on the 911 network in North Carolina. They chose North Carolina because the state has published extensive information about its 911 network. It has, for example, 20 routers and 188 call centers that handle more than 23,000 emergency calls daily and more than 8 million annually.

But North Carolina has a problem shared by many other states — many of its call centers rely on a single router to process 911 calls. By overwhelming one router, an attacker can affect many call centers. One North Carolina router known as the Rocky Mount SR, for example, feeds 64 call centers — more than half the state’s call centers.

The researchers found that with just 6,000 infected phones, they could prevent more than 50 percent of wireless callers in the state from reaching 911, in addition to a good percentage of landline callers.

Countermeasures and mitigation

The researchers say state authorities could resolve the problem in part by making sure they have redundancy in 911 networks so that a single router doesn’t become a major point of failure in an attack.

Federal authorities could also address the problem by telling carriers they no longer have to process calls from phones that aren't attached to a service plan. The FCC introduced a proposal last year to consider doing this, since such phones are already a problem for a different reason — many pranksters use these phones to make bogus 911 calls, since the calls can't be traced to them.

Public safety groups expressed support for the FCC proposal to eliminate the requirement, but the movement stalled this year because the FCC only plans to eliminate the requirement that carriers process such calls, not ban carriers from processing them, which would give them legal protection. Without the latter protection, Forgety says, carriers are too afraid of the liability they could face if they opt to block a legitimate call and that leads to a death or injury.

Another way to address the problem would be to alter phone hardware in a way that would prevent attackers from changing the IMSI and IMEI numbers on smartphones and replacing them with random ones. Or hardware makers could install a firewall on their devices that would detect and block repeated 911 calls that have the characteristics of botnet activity. Both of these solutions, however, would take time to implement and require the cooperation of phone manufacturers.

Whatever occurs, Guri and his colleagues say authorities need to act soon since it will only be a matter of time before attackers target 911 systems — if they haven't already.

Though the data came from the site's separate forum, other users of the site were reporting their data had been included in the breach as accounts were shared between the two sites for convenience.

The breach was due to vulnerabilities in the vBulletin forum management software, according to Brazzers publicity manager Matt Stevens. It's not the first time the software has been blamed for stolen passwords, with millions of accounts stolen from other vBulletin-powered forums earlier this year.

While it may not be quite as compromising as the recent Ashley Madison hack and subsequent extortion attempts, the slightly older cache of passwords still points to the need for encrypted password security.

If the rumours are true, the iPhone could rival the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge which came out in February, featuring rounded glass edges

Separate rumour in March claimed that iPhone 7 will have curved glass

Source says Apple has revisited a patent filed in 2013 for a curved screen

Earlier this year, analysts advising Apple investors claimed that the iPhone 7 would be cased in curved glass made from liquid metal.

Now, a source speaking to the the Nikkei Asian Review claims this curved screen will appear in iPhone 8.

They say that Apple will launch three models in 2017 - one measuring 4.7-inches and two measuring 5.5-inches - one of which will have a curved display.

Rumours suggest that the iPhone 7 will be cased in curved glass made from liquid metal. Artist Martin Hajek created this concept images ahead of the iPhone 6 launch, based on similar rumours at the time

HOW WOULD APPLE MAKE ITS CURVED GLASS CASE? The firm filed a patent in 2013 for a curved glass phone case made from liquidmetal. Liquidmetal is a mix of titanium, nickel, copper and zirconium among other metals making it tough, light and scratch resistant. It also feels as smooth as glass. It is a slow cooling alloy which means it can be moulded more easily than steel or aluminium, and is more hard wearing. The patents detail a process that involves injection moulding and 3D printing using bulk metallic glasses (BMG) powder - another name for liquidmetal. Layers of BMG could be printed using a 3D printer to create the casing for phones, tablets and even TVs. Advertisement

If the rumours are true, the iPhone 8 could rival the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge which came out in February this year, and features a curved screen.

In January, Apple revisited a patent filed in 2013, which proposed a curved 'glass' case made from an intricate fusion of metals melted together.

The design - made from Bulk Amorphous Alloy, which is a mix of titanium, nickel, copper and zirconium melted together - is said to have the smooth texture of glass and the rigid sturdiness of rubber.

Despite widespread excitement over the unique design, it still hasn't reached the general public.

With 3D printing, this three-year-old design is now a much more realistic prospect.

The design will be similar to the iPhone 5's 'glass sandwich', but with curved glass on both sides, insiders predict.

Kuo claims the iPhone 8, which is unlikely to launch until at least September 2016, will be the firm's thinnest handset to date at just six millimeters thick.

This would put on a par with the iPod touch, and would be almost a millimetre thinner than the current iPhone 6.

OLED DISPLAYS OLED stands for organic light-emitting diode. Its panels are made from organic materials that emit light when electricity is applied to them. As a result, OLED panels don't use a backlight meaning they are thinner than LCD displays. OLEDs additionally have bright colours, brilliant contrasts and a wide-viewing angle. Advertisement

It has also been claimed that Apple plans to bring a new organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen to its iPhone this year.

OLED displays use less power and are generally brighter than their LED counterparts.

Nikkei Technology Online has previously reported that Apple met with LG and Samsung to discuss increasing OLED screen production ahead of September 2017 - the date the theoretical iPhone 8s is likely to be released.

Both LG and Samsung are among Apple’s suppliers.

According to Barrens, earlier this year Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster told clients 'we expect the iPhone 7 to sport a unique design from the iPhone 6/6S'.

He believes it will do away with the home button, instead relying on the 3D Touch screen introduced in the 6S.

If the claims are true, Apple's next-generation handset would be on a par with the 6.1mm iPod touch (pictured left, with measurements pictured right)

He said: 'As many have speculated, the addition of 3D Touch may provide Apple with a way to eliminate the home button on the phone and use the additional space to make the screen bigger or make the device smaller.'

'Another area on which we believe Apple may focus is battery life,' he said.

'Looking at Macs over the past few years, Apple has close to doubled battery life for its Macbook line up (largely 5 hour battery to ~10 hours).

'We believe battery life is one of the biggest areas of potential improvement and one that might be most welcomed by customers.'",,2023-10-26 03:48:49.342722+00:00,True,False,,,,iPhone 7 may have a CURVED screen like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge - Daily Mail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WARNING: MINOR SPOILERS AND GRAPHIC IMAGES

HBO viewers have seen graphic sex scenes many times before on the network's shows including Game of Thrones, Rome, Tell Me You Love Me and True Blood, but none compared to the one that aired on Sunday night's episode of Westworld.

For four minutes viewers watched as a number of completely nude men and women participated in an orgy together, watching couples and individuals engage in a variety of intimate acts from sexual intercourse and oral sex to female and male masturbation.

That scene, combined with the gore-filled killing of two characters on AMC's The Walking Dear one week prior has some wondering if cable has gone too far - and asking if there need to be more regulations about what can and cannot be seen on television.

Premium cable channels like HBO have almost no regulations as opposed to broadcast networks like NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox, while AMC, a basic cable channel, has far less.

Some argue that it is because these channels can show more violence and nudity that they draw in larger audiences.

Nudity: Sunday night's episode of Westworld on HBO featured a massive orgy with approximately 40 people (above)

Chages: The episode has led some to complain that the sex was too much and served no purpose while calling for more regulations on television programs

Self-pleasure: The individuals were all naked and in addition to seeing male and female genitalia, viewers could also see one woman pleasuring herself (above)

On Westworld, three of the characters (played by Evan Rachel Wood, Ben Barnes and Jimmi Simpson) were invited to a party held in the area of the park known as Pariah as a thank you.

Once they arrive, they enter a room filled entirely with naked men and women, some of whom are painted in gold, and most of whom appear to be getting intimate with one another.

Those who are not engaging in any of sort of sexually activity with another person or some sort of self-pleasure can be seen eagerly looking at the others in the room.

The scene appears to feature around 40 extras, and the casting notice for the episode made waves back in September of last year, long before the show premiered last month.

In the consent form extras had to agree to participate in 'graphic sexual situations' that would also possibly include 'genital-to-genital touching.'

The consent form stated in full: 'This document serves to inform you that this project will require you to be fully nude and/or witness others fully nude and participate in graphic sexual situations.

'By accepting this Project assignment, you may be required to do any of the following: appear fully nude; wear a pubic hair patch; perform genital-to-genital touching; have your genitals painted; simulate oral sex with hand-to-genital touching; contort to form a table-like shape while being fully nude; pose on all fours while others who are fully nude ride on your back; ride on someone’s back while you are both fully nude; and other assorted acts the Project may require.

'The Project will also include language and sexual situations that some may consider personally objectionable or uncomfortable.'

Evan Rachel Wood (above) one of the leads on the show was also in the orgy scene, but did not get naked

Keeping clothed: Ben Barnes and Jimmi Simpson (above) were also in the scene, and also did not get nude or participate in the orgy

Violent: The Westworld episode aired just one week after the violent premiere of The Walking Dead on AMC (above) which showed the brutal murder of two characters

On social media some wrote that the orgy was too much, while others said they did not think it was necessary believing that it served no real purpose in the episode.

There were also some who took issue with the fact that though the show clearly points out that there will be nudity and adult themes before each episode, it airs at 9pm on Sunday when many young people could stumble upon the program.

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, producer Jonathan Nolan said that the orgy scene was not meant to be sexy or 'titillating.'

He went on to say: 'It’s about humanizing the hosts, it’s about control. This is the one episode where we were going for it - to show the pure pleasure of this place.'

He later added of the the shoot: 'I think everyone had a good time and it was done as respectfully and carefully as possible. And that scene in Pariah was hugely ambitious and beautifully shot.'

The episode aired a week after The Walking Dead episode, which was on basic cable and showed the gruesome murder of two characters.

The climactic scene featured Abraham (played by Michael Cudlitz) being beaten to death with a bat that is adorned with barbed wire, christened 'Lucille' by Negan, the show's new villain (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan).

The camera captures the blunt force hits, with one shot showing the other charcater Glenn's (played by Steven Yeun) eye popping out of its socket.

There were also close-up shots of crushed skulls and brain matter seeping out of Abraham and Glenn after they were bludgeoned to death.

That lead the Parents Television Council to release a statement saying: 'Last night's season premiere of The Walking Dead was one of the most graphically violent shows we've ever seen on television, comparable to the most violent of programs found on premium cable networks.'",,2023-10-26 06:35:28.744510+00:00,True,False,,,,Westworld four-minute orgy scene leads to complaints that cable has gone too far - Daily Mail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Reuters) - Medical device maker St. Jude Medical Inc said on Friday it has notified doctors to stop implants of one of its cardiac pacemakers, citing reports of problems with electronic data reporting caused by a battery malfunction that could put patients at risk.

The affected device is the Nanostim leadless cardiac pacemaker (LCP). St. Jude, which is being acquired by Abbott Laboratories, said it had seven reports of lost telemetry and heart pacing output from the devices.

Of a total of 1,423 Nanostim devices implanted worldwide, 1,397 remain in service and represent a potential risk to patients, the company warned.

There have been no reports of patient injury associated with the malfunction, St. Jude said.

“We are currently working to ensure our physician partners worldwide have the information they need to effectively manage their patients,” St. Jude Chief Medical Officer Mark Carlson said in a statement, adding that the company remains committed to developing leadless pacing technology.

In a letter to doctors, St. Jude said they should not implant any Nanostim pacemakers they might have in stock and instead return them to the company. It said device replacement is recommended, with priority given to patients with implants of the longest duration.

Pacemakers are used to keep a patient’s heart beating at a normal healthy rate.

The seven reports of problems occurred between 29 and 37 months after implant, St. Jude said.

Two of the affected patients received replacement LCPs, three received more traditional pacemakers and two are awaiting replacement devices, it said. The company said it will analyze returned LCPs.

The LCP issue follows other recent problems with St. Jude heart devices. Earlier this month, the company announced a recall of some of its other implanted heart devices due to risk of premature battery depletion, which was linked to two deaths in Europe.

That recall involved ICDs and CRT-Ds that are used to shock a dangerously racing heart back to its normal rhythm, or to help maintain a normal heart rhythm. ICDs are implantable cardioverter defibrillators, while CRT-D stands for cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator.

Can the world wide web survive the internet of things? It’s a question many are asking after a vast attack on US and European internet structure last week, likely led by “smart” DVR players and webcams, that has left the tech industry reeling.

And according to experts, unless hardware and software manufacturers band together to improve the security of the open internet – and quickly – more attacks are imminent.

The attack on the internet infrastructure provider Dyn took down sites including Netflix, Facebook, Twitter and the Guardian last week. Dan Kaminsky, lead scientist for the cybersecurity firm White Ops, said the incident should force the tech industry to take a more serious look at its networks.

Back in 2008, Kaminsky discovered a serious vulnerability in the domain name system (DNS) – the way computers name sites on the internet – that became known as “the Kaminsky bug”. Since exposing and helping to mend that flaw, he has spoken regularly about the need for broad and free security measures online.

The attack that disabled websites across much of the continental US and Europe was a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. Dyn, a major provider of internet infrastructure, was swarmed by data requests from a network of hijacked machines – in this case, hundreds of thousands of hacked devices. Its systems were overwhelmed and its clients, some of the biggest names on the internet, were taken down as a result.

“Nothing survives floods of this nature, existing or theoretical, centralized or decentralized,” Kaminsky said. “It all falls over. The hard questions here are about preventing this sort of exposure in the first place, and about improving our ability to respond and remediate when we do get it wrong.” Prevention and remediation are the only options in the kind of attack that paralyzed Dyn, Kaminsky said.



Kaminsky predicted Friday’s botnet attack would act as a wake-up call. “The unifying principle of the internet is reliability, and systems went down,” he said. “That tends to cause improvement. ‘If we don’t do this, bad things will happen’ is not as compelling as ‘if we don’t do this, bad things will happen again’.”

One frustration among researchers is that DDoS attacks such as Friday’s siege of the Dyn servers are digital warfare of the least intelligent kind. There’s no network breach, merely a host of insecure devices hijacked using simple methods such as scanning open networks for devices using factory-default passwords. The devices are then used to artificially increase traffic beyond a network’s capacity – the computer equivalent of calling every phone in an office building at once, repeatedly.

These attacks have gotten easier as more devices have gotten “smart”; suddenly, people who buy coffeemakers and refrigerators are adding more computers to the internet. It’s unlikely they’re making sure those coffeemakers are defended from malware as well.

The source code for the malware used to press-gang those devices into service against Dyn has been available for mere weeks. The original program, called Mirai, is more efficient and sophisticated software than other botnets, but that bar is low.

Friday’s attacks appear to have been caused by hijacked DVRs and web-enabled cameras, many of which contained circuit boards and software manufactured by the Chinese tech firm Hangzhou Xiongmai. According to the security firm Kaspersky Lab, Hangzhou Xiongmai announced recalls for 4.3m circuit boards used in cameras on Friday. The company blamed users for not changing the default passwords on its devices.

Anthony Grieco, senior director of the security and trust organization at Cisco, told the Guardian at a Monday morning cybersecurity conference in Manhattan that securing every internet of things (IoT) device would be difficult. “Protecting all sources is a real challenge,” he said. “The target, the surface, is where energy needs to be focused.”



Asked whether Cisco should or could harden all its routers against transmitting DDoS traffic, Grieco said the devices themselves should be secured. “I think you get to a conversation about form and function,” he said. “What should a device be doing, what’s anomalous, what’s not, what are the best practices that need to be implemented on those devices – I think that’s what we really need to focus on.”

There are calls for players outside the tech industry to step in, as well: many are calling for the US government to regulate IoT security. Matthew Cook, co-founder of the gaming security company Panopticon Labs, likened the situation to banking industry regulation of computer-based fraud. “The banks spent years trying to inform consumers, and finally the FDIC had to step in and regulate,” Cook said.

In fact, on Friday, as the attack was underway, industry representatives held a prescheduled meeting with the US national telecommunications and information administration (NTIA).

There are few leads in the search for the perpetrators of Friday’s hack on Dyn, but Kaminsky said he hoped companies would begin to think about security as a matter of public benefit rather than as private detective work. “Maybe we look to public health and fire safety. It’s not that they ignore attribution – we still remember Typhoid Mary! – but it’s not their focus, nor the root of their relative success.”

Nintendo

Nintendo's always had two different sets of products: handhelds, and TV-connected consoles , going back to the Gameboy and the NES. The Nintendo Switch is a fusion.

Announced today, and coming in March 2017, the long-awaited system looks exactly like rumors said it would. It's a handheld system, a gaming tablet and a dockable console in one. You can watch the full launch trailer on Nintendo's YouTube channel.

The Nintendo Switch feels like several products in one: a handheld, a follow-up console to the Wii U and a convertible tablet. But it also seems very focused on multiplayer gaming, especially with others in the same room.

What we know now from the video, and a press release sent afterwards from Nintendo:

Two controllers add onto the tablet to turn it into a Nintendo Wii U-like game pad. These are called ""Joy-Con"" controllers. Each one has four buttons and an analog stick, like the Wii U game pad.

It's portable like a Nintendo 3DS , but larger. Think iPad or gaming tablet more than pocket handheld.

The controllers can detach and a kickstand comes out, turning it into a tabletop game system like an iPad and game controller.

Each Joy-Con controller can act as its own controller, too, like a Wii remote. It can be used for two-player games on the fly.

The Joy-Con controllers also slide into a Joy-Con Grip accessory to turn into a full stand-alone controller. Alternatively, a full controller called the Nintendo Switch Pro can be used, which looks more like a standard Wii U Pro controller .

It slides into a dock (the Nintendo Switch Dock) and turns into a TV-connected console. The handheld-to-TV switch happens instantly once the Switch is placed in the dock.

Nintendo has announced a variety of publishers working on Switch games, including Ubisoft, Konami, EA, Capcom, Bethesda and Epic. Bethesda's classic RPG Skyrim is prominently featured in the video.

The Switch looks like a completely new platform compared to the Wii U and 3DS, but the trailer shows people playing Splatoon, a Wii U game...and small pop-in cartridges. We don't know if it's backwards-compatible yet.

Chipmaker Nvidia says it's supplying the innards.

There are still plenty of questions we have about the Nintendo Switch. How much will it cost? We don't know. Will it come packaged with the dock and those Joy-Con controllers, or be offered in various bundles? Is it backwards-compatible? And, does it even have a touchscreen? (In the video and Nintendo's press release, no mention or demonstration of any touch-related functions can be found.)

Some of the Nintendo Switch developers announced so far. Nintendo

If the Switch runs its own software that won't play with Wii U or 3DS games, it could mean building a whole library over again. The Nintendo 3DS could transfer older Nintendo DS games, and the Wii U is backwards-compatible with the Wii games and controllers.

We may not know much more until next year.

Update, 11.38 a.m. ET: Added the developer slide, and some more thoughts.

50640,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/lastpass-update-hackers-cybersecurity-keep-passwords-safe/,2017-04-03 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnet.com,,"Published on None. Password managers: they're the best way to keep your accounts safe from hackers. They're also one of the most tempting targets on the internet for hackers.

That irony was on clear display for all of last week, when password manager LastPass said it was fixing a major flaw. Found by Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy, the flaw was so serious that LastPass urged users not to use its browser extension until they fixed the problem.

How bad could it be? The bug could have let hackers breach your account, taking your passwords and changing things in your account. The vulnerability was in the LastPass browser extension, a service that can auto-fill usernames and passwords into log-in pages.

Late Friday, the company said the problem was fixed. Now, users should make sure they're using the most up-to-date version of the security software.

How can I make sure my LastPass account is safe?

LastPass users should make sure they have the updated version of the browser extension installed on every browser they use. That would be version number 4.1.44 or higher.

To check the version number, log into LastPass through the browser extension and select More Options > About LastPass. This will show you the software version you're running. LastPass said Friday that most users should be automatically updated to the patched version of the extension.

If that's not the case for you, download the updated extension from LastPass.com.

Am I doomed if I used LastPass last week?

You might be thinking, ""I had no idea I wasn't supposed to be using the LastPass browser extension last week."" Fair enough.

The patch took all of last week because the flaw stemmed from something fundamental in the way the browser extension worked, said Joe Siegrist, vice president and general manager at LastPass parent company LogMeIn, in his updated blog post late Friday.

""This was not a simple patch, and required a thoughtful, thorough fix,"" Siegrist said. ""Those changes then needed to be applied and tested across all affected extensions.""

The good news is that hackers couldn't have used the security flaw to break into many accounts at once -- they would have had to go to a lot of extra effort, Siegrist said.

A hacker would have to individually target you, sending an email meant to trick you into clicking on a link and downloading malicious software. That software would have let a hacker exploit the flaw in the LastPass browser extension and sneak into your account.

That said, if you're feeling extra paranoid, it's always good to regularly change your passwords. Go ahead and do so if you want to, and also consider adding two-factor authentication to your LastPass and other accounts. LastPass supports a number of different two-factor authentication methods, all of which require you to enter additional information (like a one-time code) to log into your account from a new location.

Is a password manager really a good idea if it can be hacked?

Yes, it's still a very good idea.

Much more common than a security flaw in a password manager is a giant data breach. That's when hackers sweep up thousands, millions or even a billion usernames and passwords from major web services. The most high profile of these were two separate breaches of Yahoo 's user information, both of which came to light in 2016.

These breaches are bad enough. A hacker can do a lot of damage with the keys to your email account, potentially using it to reset passwords to your bank account, for example. Making them worse is our tendency to reuse passwords between websites. If you were using the same password for Yahoo as you were for something else important (that bank account comes to mind again), you'd be in trouble.

But the human mind has its limits, and it's nearly impossible to remember unique, complex passwords for the dozens of online accounts many people have these days. Password managers make it possible by remembering for you.

Just be sure to keep the software that powers your password manager up to date.

The Lofree Bluetooth keyboard was made for the first group. Its adorable design, with rounded edges and circular keys, is reminiscent of a classic typewriter. And as a mechanical keyboard (versus a more pedestrian membrane keyboard), it was made to sound just like a typewriter, too.

There's no shortage of mechanical keyboards with minimalist appeal, yet ones that would actually catch the eye of a hip lifestyle blogger or design nerd are few and far between. If you desire an attractive keyboard that'll take your Instagram-worthy workspace to the next level, or if you want to enjoy the soothing clacking of a typewriter while you work, the Lofree is the perfect antidote to clunky gamer-geared models.

It's currently available internationally via Kickstarter and will be on sale for $129 via Amazon in May. Official UK and AU pricing have yet to be confirmed. Pricing directly converts to £104 and AU$172.

Fashion forward

The cutest mechanical keyboard I ever did see. Josh Miller/CNET

For the design-inclined with a soft spot for nostalgia, the Lofree is love at first sight. It's so stinking cute it almost looks like it's a toy. That's not to say that it looks cheap. For an all-plastic design, it's stylish and feels solid. It's also got some weight to it and four grippy nubs attached to the bottom to ensure it doesn't slide around when typing.

The Lofree keyboard is easy to pair and can pair with up to three devices at the same time. It's compatible with Android and iOS, as well as Windows 10 and Macs. The top row of buttons has the same layout as Apple's Magic Keyboard, making it an easy transition for Mac users. It charges via Micro-USB and includes a charging cord.

Since it's made to sound exactly like a typewriter, the Lofree keyboard is very noisy, though not loud enough to disrupt my co-workers too much (or so they told me). Fingerpads easily slink into the smooth, concave, backlit keys, which are strangely satisfying to press, thanks in part to the sound they make.





Too cute to be true

Unfortunately, typing on the keyboard takes some time to get used to -- if you get used to it at all. I'm accustomed to stretching out my right pinky finger to hit the backspace and enter buttons without having to look or lift the rest of my fingers off the keyboard.

If only it was as comfy as my ugly ergonomic keyboard. Josh Miller/CNET

On the Lofree keyboard those keys are spaced so far away from the home keys; looking down to find them felt awkward. Otherwise I would accidentally press the wrong keys and consistently cause typos. After a few days, I got frustrated of using it. To relieve the problem I returned to my ugly, oversized, wired ergonomic keyboard instead.

Anyone who's ever worn a killer pair of heels in the name of fashion knows that, in certain situations, aesthetics beat practicality. It all depends on which one's more important to you.

It comes in a variety of colors. Josh Miller/CNET

For connecting to a TV or casual use, like cranking out quick emails or researching an upcoming vacation, the Lofree keyboard is a fine, uncommon choice for those who like aesthetically pleasing devices. But I definitely wouldn't recommend it for full-time writers or anyone who depends heavily on an efficient keyboard.

51374,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/21/apple-removes-malicious-programs-after-first-major-attack-on-app-store,2015-09-21 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2015-09-21 00:00:00. Apple has had to remove more than 300 malware-infected apps from its app store after a tainted version of its developer tools led to a number of Chinese apps leaking users’ personal information to hackers.



The company confirmed on Sunday night that it was removing the apps after several cybersecurity firms reported finding a malicious program dubbed “XcodeGhost” that was embedded in hundreds of legitimate apps.

It is the first reported case of large numbers of malicious software programs making their way past Apple’s stringent app review process. Prior to this attack, a total of just five malicious apps had ever been found in the app store, according to cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks.

Apple said the hackers embedded the malicious code in these apps by convincing developers of legitimate software to use a tainted, counterfeit version of Apple’s software for creating iOS and Mac apps, which is known as Xcode.

“We’ve removed the apps from the app store that we know have been created with this counterfeit software,” Apple spokeswoman Christine Monaghan said in an email. “We are working with the developers to make sure they’re using the proper version of Xcode to rebuild their apps.“

She did not say what steps iPhone and iPad users could take to determine whether their devices were infected.

The infected version of Xcode achieved its spread due to a quirk of Chinese internet filtering. Due to the country’s widespread censorship of the web, connections to servers located internationally are significantly slower than those situated within China. That leads to Chinese internet users frequently seeking an alternative domestic source for large downloads.

The latest version of Apple’s developer tools, Xcode 7.1, is more than 4GB in size, leading to many Chinese developers downloading versions hosted elsewhere. Some of those versions were infected with XcodeGhost, which inserted the privacy-busting code into the apps. The Guardian understands that many of the developers will also have had to disable Gatekeeper, Apple’s own security software, in order to run the infected version of Xcode.

Ryan Olson, director of threat intelligence at Palo Alto Networks, said the malware had limited functionality and his firm had uncovered no examples of data theft or other harm as a result of the attack.

However, he said it was “a pretty big deal” because it showed that the app store could be compromised if hackers infected machines of software developers writing legitimate apps. Other attackers may copy that approach, which is hard to defend against, he said.

“Developers are now a huge target,” he added.

Researchers said infected apps included Tencent Holdings’ popular mobile chat app WeChat, car-hailing app Didi Kuaidi and a music app from internet portal NetEase. Palo Alto Networks published a list of 39 of the affected apps, while Dutch security firm Fox-IT added its own findings to the list.

Some apps named by the two firms share a name with popular apps used outside China, but appear to be deliberately mis-titled versions of the apps intended to cash in on mistaken downloads.

Chinese security firm Qihoo360 Technology said on its blog that it had uncovered 344 apps tainted with XcodeGhost.

Tencent said on its official WeChat blog that the security flaw affects WeChat 6.2.5, an old version of its popular chatting app, and that newer versions were unaffected. A preliminary investigation showed there had been no data theft or leakage of user information, the company said.

Apple declined to say how many apps it had uncovered, and did not provide a list of affected apps or details about how many users had downloaded them.",,2023-10-26 21:56:05.251373+00:00,True,True,True,,0.7966747826914589,Apple removes malicious programs after first major attack on app store - The Guardian,Apple Removes Over 300 Malware-Infected Apps from App Store,"The software failure incident occurred in September 2015.

Long before  Volkswagen  admitted to cheating on emissions tests for millions of cars worldwide, the automobile industry, Volkswagen included, had a well-known record of sidestepping regulation and even duping regulators. For decades, car companies found ways to rig mileage and emissions testing data. In Europe, some automakers have taped up test cars’ doors and grilles to bolster their aerodynamics. Others have used “superlubricants” to reduce friction in the car’s engine to a degree that would be impossible in real-world driving conditions. Automakers have even been known to make test vehicles lighter by removing the back seats. Cheating in the United States started as soon as governments began regulating automotive emissions in the early 1970s. In 1972, certification of  Ford Motor ’s new cars was held up after the Environmental Protection Agency found that the company had violated rules by performing constant maintenance of its test cars, which reduced emissions but did not reflect driving conditions in the real world.  Ford  walked away with a  $7 million fine . The next year, the agency fined Volkswagen $120,000 after finding that  the company had installed devices  intended specifically to shut down a vehicle’s pollution control systems. In 1974,  Chrysler  had to recall more than 800,000 cars because similar devices were found in the radiators of its cars. How Volkswagen’s ‘Defeat Devices’ Worked Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

52403,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/23/talktalk-cyber-attack-company-unsure-how-many-users-affected,2015-10-23 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2015-10-23 00:00:00. TalkTalk has said it does not know how many of its 4 million customers have been affected by a “significant and sustained” cyber-attack which could have compromised credit card and bank details.

Dido Harding, the chief executive, apologised to customers for the third cyber-attack affecting the telecommunications firm in the past 12 months but said the breaches were “completely unrelated”.

Harding told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that TalkTalk moved as fast as possible after being alerted to the hack. “On Wednesday lunchtime, all we knew was that our website was running slowly and that we had the indications of a hacker trying to attack us,” she said. “I can’t even tell you today exactly how many customers have been affected. We have tried to come public as fast as we can once we have got a reasonable idea of what potential data has been lost.

“I really appreciate the frustration and the worry and the concern that this causes customers – I am a customer myself – and I am very sorry for that. We are rushing to try and get that information to our customers as fast as we possibly can.”

TalkTalk admitted in its website FAQs section that some of the data was not encrypted but said it believed the firm’s systems were as secure as they could be.



Harding said Wednesday’s attack on TalkTalk’s systems should be treated as a crime. “Whether it is the US government, Apple, a host of companies, cybercrime is something we all need to get better at defending ourselves against,” she said.

The Metropolitan police cybercrime unit has launched an investigation into the breach amid speculation that the attackers could be Islamic extremists or extortionists.

Adrian Culley, a former detective at Scotland Yard’s cybercrime unit, said the hack appeared to be the work of Islamic militants after a group claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of Allah.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It appears at face value to be Islamic cyberterrorism.”

The claim could not be verified, but Culley pointed out that a group calling themselves “TalkTalk Hackers” published what they claimed were a sample of dozens of email addresses and national security numbers as proof of the attack.

They posted the message on the site Pastebin, which is often used by hackers for publishing large amounts of information. The message used the rhetoric of Islamic militants to justify the hack. It said: “We will teach our children to use the web for Allah … your hands will be covered in blood … judgement day is soon.”

Culley said the attack was a matter of national security. He said: “By the very nature of who TalkTalk are, they are [a] communications service provider, they are also part of the UK’s critical national infrastructure, so this is a concern not just for the police but the security services.”

Scotland Yard said: “There have been no arrests and inquiries are ongoing. We are aware of speculation regarding alleged perpetrators. This investigation remains at an early stage. A full assessment of the alleged data theft is ongoing.”

TalkTalk said: “That investigation is ongoing, but unfortunately there is a chance that some of the following data has been compromised: names, addresses, date of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, TalkTalk account information, credit card details and/or bank details.

“We are continuing to work with leading cybercrime specialists and the Metropolitan police to establish exactly what happened and the extent of any information accessed.”

TalkTalk shares tumbled more than 10%, wiping almost £300m from its stock market value, as investors worried about the financial impact of the cyber-attack.

One security expert said the breach could destroy trust in the phone and broadband provider. Jason du Preez, the chief executive of the data privacy company Privitar, said: “These hacks are not just embarrassing to the organisations involved. They can have really serious financial and personal consequences for your users, destroying consumer trust and loyalty.”

TalkTalk’s approach was criticised by cybersecurity expert Peter Sommer, a visiting professor at De Montfort University’s cybersecurity unit, who told Today: “Good practice says you ought to encrypt your data. The problem for these companies is staging their investment. They are constantly acquiring new customers, they are providing new services, the customers themselves want more facilities.

“You can quite see a situation in which, for straightforward commercial reasons a company decides to delay a little bit putting in an upgrade, it then has difficulties with the upgrade, it doesn’t think about the changed security environment, hackers are using new techniques all the time, and that’s the decision they have to make. It looks as though they have made some rather unfortunate decisions.”



Sommer said it was “not impossible” Islamic cyberterrorists were behind the attack, but it was more likely to be an attempt to extort money from TalkTalk or gain access to customers’ personal information.



“It seems to me the suggestion that these are Islamic terrorists who are perpetrating it is unlikely, not impossible,” he said. “One has to look at what is probably the most likely outcome. One of them is an extortion attempt, since they have gone public I suspect that’s not going to work. The other one is just to get hold of the credit card information, get hold of the personal information.”



Customers criticised TalkTalk over the announcement on Twitter. Katie Jonas said she had been on hold to TalkTalk customer services for more than an hour. “I’m very concerned that my bank details may have been taken but didn’t want to have to change all bank details. It’s a lot of hassle doing so but now it looks like I will have to after the disgusting customer service,” she said.

“I was angry enough being on hold that long but to then be cut off is terrible.”

In a letter to customers, TalkTalk’s managing director, Tristia Harrison, said the company took “any threat to the security of our customers’ data very seriously”.



The company said it had contacted major banks, which will monitor any suspicious activity from customers’ accounts, as well as the Information Commissioner’s Office. It is also organising free credit monitoring for a year for all customers.

Any customers who notice unusual activity on their accounts have been advised to contact their bank and Action Fraud, the UK’s national fraud and internet crime reporting centre. They have also been urged to change their TalkTalk account passwords and any other accounts that use the same passwords.",,2023-10-27 01:55:58.114942+00:00,True,True,False,,,TalkTalk cyber-attack: company unsure how many customers affected - The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52749,https://www.cnet.com/reviews/motorola-moto-360-2015-review/,2015-10-11 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnet.com,,"Published on None. A watch is a personal device. Some people have a specific watch to go with a certain outfit, while others may swap out straps to match how they are feeling on a given day. Many of the smartwatches available today let you swap bands, and some are even offered in different colors and sizes -- but no device has felt as personal as my Moto 360.

The Good The Moto 360 is stylish and comfortable to wear. It's offered in two sizes, can be personalized through Motorola's Moto Maker website, and is one of the few smartwatches to include an ambient light sensor for automatically adjusting brightness. The Bad Battery life is short for a watch. Android Wear software feels awkward. The round display isn't a complete circle -- there's a black bar at the bottom. The Bottom Line Improved performance and unique customization options make the Moto 360 a worthy successor to last year's smartwatch, but it has the same limitations as other Android Wear watches on the market.

Motorola's watch can be customized to your liking using the company's Moto Maker website. You can choose the color of the bezel, the bezel treatment, case color and band type. Want a two-tone watch? No problem. Maybe one with a textured bezel? Why not? All of this is possible with the new Moto 360. According to Motorola, there are more than 300 options to choose from.

But here's the problem: while the new Moto 360 is better than last year's, it does little to stand out in the growing Android Wear watch world. There aren't any cool added features like NFC for mobile payments (Android Wear doesn't allow that yet) or GPS (for that, you have to wait for the Moto 360 Sport model). And some competing smartwatches even have better-looking screens, like the sapphire crystal display in the Huawei Watch.

Sarah Tew/CNET

The Moto 360 now comes in two sizes: a 42mm model with 20mm or 16mm strap, and a 46mm with a 22mm band (slightly larger than last year's 45mm model). I wore the larger 46mm model, which starts at $350 in the US. There is also a special ""women's collection"" that features a 42mm face and a slim 16mm strap.

Prices range depending on what model you pick, but they're all more expensive. They start at $300 for the 42mm model -- a $50 premium over what last year's original went for -- and go up to $430. In the UK the 42mm for men costs £229, for women it's £259, and the men's 46mm is £269. Motorola has confirmed that the watches are heading to Australia, but hasn't supplied even a ballpark date yet. The UK prices convert to AU$480, AU$540 and AU$560, respectively.

The Moto 360 is better, but it's also less distinctive.

Hardware and design

The first thing you notice with the Moto 360 is that it has almost no bezel -- it's stunning. But then you notice the display isn't a complete circle, like the Huawei Watch or LG Watch Urbane . There's still a black bar at the bottom of the screen. Just like last year.

The black bar, which many jokingly refer to as the ""flat tire,"" is home to the ambient light sensor, which automatically sets display brightness. It's convenient, but not at the cost of a cut-off screen.

Motorola claims most users don't notice the bar. I did. I notice it when the circular watch face I have installed is cut off at the bottom, and I notice it with any background that isn't black.

Sarah Tew/CNET

Motorola opted for an LCD display rather than AMOLED. To me it looks less crisp, more pixelated. The 42mm Moto 360 features a 1.37-inch display with a pixel resolution of 360x325, while the display on my reviewed 46mm model is 1.56 inches and 360x330 pixels (263 pixels per inch and 233 ppi, respectively). The Huawei Watch has a sharper a 1.4-inch 400x400-pixel resolution display. Not by much, but enough to matter.

The Moto 360 screen is also slightly raised up from its steel casing, with a slight angled bevel on the edge. It might make for easier swipes, but weirdly warps the edge of watch faces.

The new Moto 360 does look more like a real watch, though, largely because it now has traditional watch lugs. These look great, make it easier to swap out the strap for a new one, and make the watch more flexible and comfortable to wear. The crown button has also shifted to the top right, around 2 o'clock. But it's still just a basic button, unlike the spinning digital crown on the Apple Watch . You can't use it to scroll through apps: it only dims the display and accesses the app menu.

Sarah Tew/CNET

Some of the changes in the new Moto 360 are ones you can't see. The processor has received a significant boost, which improves overall performance. But I still notice some lag when the watch screen ""wakes up"" to full brightness from the dim power-saving mode.

Inside is a 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor, 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal storage for apps and music, which is pretty standard for Android Wear watches. There's also Wi-Fi on board, so you can use the watch even if your iPhone or Android smartphone is left behind. It's just like what's in other recent Android Wear watches from LG and Huawei.

Sarah Tew/CNET

An optical heart-rate sensor sits on the back of the watch and measures your heart rate automatically at different times throughout the day, much like the Apple Watch. You can also manually check it on-demand. Its heart-rate functions are a step above many other Android Wear watches such as the Huawei Watch and LG Watch Urbane, which only spot-check heart rate.

Motorola even has a heart activity app that tries to estimate active exercise through the day. It's not perfect, but it's better than anything Google offers. The Moto 360 also tracks steps, like all these watches, but lacks GPS for pace and distance when running. A Sport model with GPS is coming later this year, in a more ruggedized design.

The watch has a water-resistant rating of IP67: you can wear it while washing the dishes or the occasional shower (sans the leather strap of course), but you shouldn't wear it in the pool. This is true for all Android Wear watches.

Sarah Tew/CNET

Software: It's Android Wear with some added features

The Moto 360 is powered by Google's Android Wear operating system, which is its biggest downside. Android Wear has been around for over a year and is getting better over time -- recent updates have added Wi-Fi support and limited functionality for iPhone users -- but on the whole it's a strange and limited operating system. Android Wear is a lot like Google Now or the Google Search app on iPhones and iPads, but on your wrist. You will see personalized Google Now cards with information on weather, transportation and sporting events as well as notifications for things like text messages, emails, calls and calendar alerts from your phone.

Sarah Tew/CNET

Notifications and alerts on Android Wear are very big. And some cards don't always seem necessary. But Android Wear does allow some dictated message responses, and Google search does work well. There are also hundreds of compatible Android apps that will work with Android Wear. This isn't yet an option for iPhone users.

Motorola bundles a handful of custom watch faces and an app for tracking health and fitness with the Moto 360 called Moto Body. It uses data collected by the heart-rate monitor and other sensors to deliver you detailed stats on your daily and weekly activities. It's one of the better built-in fitness tracking apps for Android Wear, much better than Google's own Fit app, but it's not nearly as detailed as apps from Fitbit and Jawbone.

Sarah Tew/CNET

Motorola did as much as it could to make Android Wear appealing, but it still feels incomplete, and that's Android Wear's fault. Many pop-up cards still feel like a nuisance, and the feature set on all Android Wear watches remain limited. You can use Android Wear watches over Wi-Fi networks away from your phone, but only for some functions.

The Moto 360 also lacks NFC, and doesn't support mobile payments. That's because Android Wear doesn't, either. The Apple Watch and eventually the Samsung Gear S2 will. We don't know when Google will enable Android Wear to pay for a cup of coffee, but it's yet another area where Android Wear is lagging.

Sarah Tew/CNET

Battery life

Battery life remains a problem with many smartwatches on the market, and the Moto 360 is no exception. The 46mm model has a 400mAh battery that lasted more than a day and a half with the always-on screen feature enabled and using the ""auto"" brightness setting. The smaller 42mm Moto 360 has a smaller 300mAh battery. It's similar to other Android Wear watches and the Apple Watch, but a lot worse than the Pebble Time Steel , which lasts a full week. I eked out two days of battery life with the always-on display setting turned off.

Sarah Tew/CNET

At least the Moto 360 comes with a great wireless charging cradle. Once it begins charging, the watch enters a bedside clock mode, too. Oddly enough, it doesn't charge when placed on my Energizer Dual Inductive Charger , even though the old Moto 360 would.

Conclusion

Sarah Tew/CNET

The new Moto 360 is better than the original model in almost every way possible. It looks nicer, performs better, is more comfortable to wear, and has longer battery life. But it's also more expensive, and the smartwatch market has changed since the original 360 debuted in September of 2014.

There are a lot of round smartwatches now, and a lot of good-looking ones, too. The Moto 360 may be better than many, but it doesn't stand alone anymore.",,2023-10-27 02:12:37.034888+00:00,True,False,,,,Moto 360 (2015) review: A better (but pricier) Moto smartwatch - CNET,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53974,https://www.wired.com/2015/11/airbus-patents-detachable-cabins-to-cut-plane-boarding-times/,2015-11-25 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.wired.com,,"Published on 2015-11-25 15:05:32+00:00.  All right, everyone.  It’s quiz time. What’s the worst part about flying? ""Everything,"" is an entirely appropriate response, but the one thing that's most miserable about flying is the waiting. Waiting to get through security. Waiting for bad food and overpriced water. Waiting to get on the damn plane, waiting to get off the damn plane. You'd think the industry's approach to customer service is ""hurry up and wait,"" but airlines hate waiting as much as you do. Every moment a plane is a stationary is a moment it isn't making money. Boeing says cutting an airplane's ""turn-time""—its time on the ground—by 10 minutes  improves utilization level 8.1 percent . That's a big deal in an industry that typically earns a  profit of just $8.27 per passenger , and it's why flight attendants practically push you down the aisle. Airlines want you seated ASAP. That's got Airbus reconsidering the boarding process with an idea to turn aircraft cabins into what amount to shipping containers. We'll pause here to let you groan. You know Airbus. Aside from making the  magnificently huge A380  and very popular A320, the company's also offered two of the most questionable seating ideas imaginable: The  backless bike-seat half-stand model  and what we call the  steerage concept  that essentially stacks passengers. The people in charge of R&D seem to spend a decent amount of time dreaming up ways to make flying even more hellish, but the latest idea—filed in February 2013 and  approved by the United States Patent and Trademark Office  just yesterday—shifts the focus from seats to the cabin itself. To reduce a plane's turn-time, Airbus proposes “a removable cabin module, comprising a floor, an upper aircraft fuselage portion connected to the floor, and a first and a second end wall, wherein the first and second end walls, the floor and the upper aircraft fuselage portion form a cabin for transport of passengers, luggage, freight or combinations thereof.” In other words, it’s a detachable cabin passengers board while its at the gate. Once everyone is seated, the pod is lowered onto the plane. When you arrive at your destination, the cabin is removed, another is added, and the plane takes off. The time it spends on the ground is drastically reduced. It’s not the craziest idea. If everything in the cabin could be ready and waiting for the pilots when they arrive with the flatbed, as it were, then once the cabin container attached itself you’d be off and running in a jiffy. Airbus has called this the ""aircraft pod concept,"" saying ""passengers could be pre-seated in cabin pods before the plane actually arrives, ready for integration on the aircraft, saving time and making processing much simpler."" But there are few industries so tightly regulated as the airline industry, and one imagines that the safety protocol of ensuring the pod doesn't pop off at 36,000 feet would negate at least some of the time saved by not waiting for that jerk with the oversized carry-on to finally check the damn thing.Then there’s the matter of airport infrastructure. Airbus’ patent includes drawings of the docking stations and transport equipment to shuttle the cabin containers about, but short of snapping our fingers and ending up in Tomorrowland, this kind of terminal overhaul feels highly unlikely. That, and the fact that  designing a new plane from scratch  takes about a decade and billions of dollars. Something this different from the status quo would almost certainly take more time and more money. So, yeah. The “Method for boarding and unloading of passengers of an aircraft with reduced immobilization time of the aircraft, aircraft and air terminal for its implementation” won’t be coming to an airport near you any time soon, but at least the designers and engineers at Airbus are dreaming big. And if they get cracking on that  VR-helmet idea  they floated awhile ago, we might actually start looking forward to the waiting after all.",,2023-10-27 05:59:16.207945+00:00,True,False,,,,Airbus Patents Detachable Cabins to Cut Plane Boarding Times - WIRED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57963,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-galaxy-a3-2017-fcc-certification/,2016-12-22 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnet.com,,"Published on None. 

Samsung's rumored 2017 follow-up to the Galaxy A3 has yet to be officially announced, but could be a step closer to making the jump from rumor to reality. A phone fitting the A3 2017's description was spotted on the FCC's certification website, leading many to believe it's as good as done (products that clear the FCC still may never come to light; that's up to the company).

The FCC listing in question is filed for a device with the model number SM-A320F. It is believed that this is the model number of the new Galaxy A3 due to its similarity to the 2016 A3 model number (SM-A310F). Other than that the listing doesn't tell us too much, only certain Wi-Fi credentials and that it was issued on December 1. The FCC certification could suggest that a launch is imminent. Some rumors say that the new A3 may come in January.

Samsung's Galaxy A is one of Samsung's budget Android devices phones, especially compared with the pricey and premium Galaxy S line. While all eyes are trained to the upcoming Galaxy S8, those seeking a lower-cost phone should shift focus to the A3 and also-rumored 2017 A7.

We've already seen some renderings of what the phone could look like, and heard speculation that the A-series might could come with Samsung's curved display. If these rumors come true, it could signal Samsung carving out an identity based on the curve.

58044,https://money.cnn.com/2016/12/01/technology/saudi-arabia-hack-shamoon/,2016-12-02 08:00:00+00:00,http://money.cnn.com,,"Published on 2016-12-01 00:00:00. Hackers destroyed computers at six important Saudi organizations two weeks ago, marking a reappearance of the most damaging cyberweapon the world has ever seen.

Last time, it was used to destroy 35,000 computers at the oil company Saudi Aramco. U.S. intelligence quietly blamed Iran for that attack.

This time around, the cyberweapon has attacked at least one Saudi government agency, as well as organizations in the energy, manufacturing and transportation sectors, according to two researchers with direct knowledge of the investigations into the attack.

Security researchers are now headed to Saudi Arabia to investigate how hackers wiped clean computers en masse, according to several experts involved.

Saudi Arabia's state news agency confirmed Wednesday a cyberattack occurred ""on various government institutions and agencies.""

""The attacks aimed at disabling all equipment and services that were being provided. The attackers were stealing data from the system and were planting viruses,"" the Saudi news agency SPA said.

The hackers targeted the Saudi aviation regulator, the General Authority of Civil Aviation, according to Patrick Wardle, a researcher with cybersecurity firm Synack. The malware code shows that it targeted employees of GACA, he said.

Cyberattacks this destructive are rare.

Hackers used a version of a specific type of cyberweapon, called Shamoon, which operates like a time bomb.

Many top cybersecurity firms -- CrowdStrike, FireEye, McAfee, Palo Alto Networks, Symantec -- issued reports documenting the attack this week.

At 8:45 p.m. local time on Nov. 17, the malicious software started wiping computers at Saudi organizations. All computer files were replaced by the tragic image of a Syrian refugee boy, 3-year-old Alan Kurdi, lying dead on a beach.

The malware then took over the computers' boot record, preventing them from being turned back on.

The hackers timed it so that no employees would be around to stop the destruction. It was Thursday, the last day of the Saudi work week.

But it's too early to blame a specific country, criminal organization or political ""hacktivist"" group.

""The malware could have been copied by other actors,"" said CrowdStrike cofounder Dmitri Alperovitch. ""We are not yet prepared to make the call.""

Alperovitch and others noted that the hack happened just days before oil-pumping OPEC countries agreed to cut oil production for the first time in eight years. There was a lot riding on that deal, which eventually favored Iran, allowing it to boost production in an attempt to reach levels it had before the nation got slapped with international sanctions.

Collin Anderson, one of the world's top experts on Iranian hacking activity, said it's possible Iran used this attack to put pressure on Saudi Arabia.

Iran and Saudi Arabia have been embroiled in a long-running power struggle for influence in the Middle East.

""We've seen a dramatic increase in the level of espionage activity conducted by hacking groups that are connected with the Iranian government,"" said Anderson, who's working on a research paper for Carnegie Endowment for International Peace that tracks the history of Iranian cyber warfare.

This latest Shamoon strike followed a similar pattern to the devastating attack on Saudi Aramco in 2012. That assault began during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, when most of the oil company employees were on holiday. Computer files were replaced by images of a burning American flag.

In that instance, a group calling itself ""Cutting Sword of Justice"" claimed responsibility, citing Aramco's support of the Al Saud royal family's authoritarian regime.

Investigators have not found any claims of responsibility for this past November's attacks.

Eric Chien, technical director at Symantec, said it's striking that hackers used the exact same weapon on yet another Saudi target -- and it worked.

Wardle agreed.

""The malware is rather poorly written, and essentially has been used before. So either GACA did not have any security software installed -- or the security software they had was rather lame and didn't detect it,"" Wardle said.
