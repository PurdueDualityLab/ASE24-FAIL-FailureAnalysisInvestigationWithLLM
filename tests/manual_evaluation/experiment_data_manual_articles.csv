23620,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/28/bbc-dmi-nao-report-mark-thompson-lord-patten,2014-01-28 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2014-01-28 00:00:00. The BBC's handling of the £100m Digital Media Initiative fiasco has come in for further criticism, with a catalogue of errors uncovered by a National Audit Office report which delivered a damning verdict on Mark Thompson and Lord Patten's handling of the IT project.

The NAO report published on Tuesday said the BBC executive board, led by then director general Thompson, had paid insufficient scrutiny to the failing IT project over an 18-month period and the BBC Trust, chaired by Patten, had not done enough to challenge it.

According to the NAO, the BBC was ""too optimistic"" about its ability to complete the project after it took it in-house from contractor Siemens in 2009, with reporting arrangements ""not fit for purpose"" and no single manager made responsible for the entire venture. DMI was eventually scrapped in May 2013, at a cost of £98.4m to licence fee payers.

The executive at the centre of the DMI initiative, chief technology officer John Linwood, left the BBC in July last year when his contract was terminated without a payoff, the corporation confirmed last week.

The project – which was supposed to do away with the need for videotapes across the BBC and use digital technology to call up archive footage - was scrapped just a month into director general Tony Hall's tenure in 2013, with the BBC Trust saying to continue it would be ""throwing good money after bad"".

A PwC report commissioned by the BBC and published last month said the corporation should have identified that DMI would fail as early as July 2011, almost two years before it was eventually shut down.

Executives criticised

Thompson, now chief executive of the New York Times, is due to return before the Commons public accounts committee on Monday, along with former BBC finance chief Zarin Patel, trustee Anthony Fry, ex-chief operating officer Caroline Thomson and operations director Dominic Coles.

He previously gave evidence to parliament about DMI in 2011 when he incorrectly claimed the scheme was already up and running. He later said he gave evidence ""honestly and in good faith"" based on information from his executives.

Patten has also come in for criticism from MPs over the issue and was accused of ""obstruction and secrecy"" for after he ordered the corporation not to disclose key documents about the failed project.

Coles, the BBC director of operations, said: ""As we have previously acknowledged, the BBC got this one wrong. We took swift action to overhaul how major projects are managed after we closed DMI last year.

""DMI aside, we have a strong track record of successfully delivering major projects such as the BBC iPlayer and the digital Olympics and we will continue to innovate to deliver new technology to the public.""

Diane Coyle, the BBC Trust vice-chair, said:""It is essential that the BBC learns from the losses incurred in the DMI project and applies the lessons to running technology projects in future.

""As we announced last December, we are working with the executive to strengthen project management and reporting arrangements within a clearer governance system. This will ensure that serious problems can be spotted and addressed at an earlier stage.""

'Insufficient scrutiny'

Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said the BBC executive ""did not have sufficient grip"" on the DMI project. ""Nor did it commission a thorough independent assessment of the whole system to see whether it was technically sound.

""If the BBC had better governance and reporting for the programme, it would have recognised the difficulties much earlier than May 2012.""

The report said the BBC's executive board ""applied insufficient scrutiny"" to the project during 2011 and the first half of 2012, with no formal checks beyond the reports prepared by the project management office.

The NAO said: ""The BBC emphasised to us that during this period it was overseeing several other major projects, including the move to Salford and preparing for the 2012 Olympics.""

In September 2011 the BBC Trust had questioned the executive about delays and likely knock-on effects to the benefits of the project, according to the NAO report, ""but then applied limited challenge until July 2012"".

It also identified a ""gap in reporting in the first part of 2012, which neither the BBC nor the BBC Trust addressed"".

The report said the BBC, which had originally commissioned Siemens to build the system in 2008 before taking it over a year later, ""did not assess the value for money and risks"" of doing the job itself and did not check its plans for DMI with independent experts.

It said the BBC left itself ""little time to meet critical internal deadlines"" with successive delays to the timetable in the face of repeated technical issues leaving it no room for manoeuvre. Such were the difficulties that some TV production teams began to instal alternative digital systems.

""Governance arrangements for the DMI programme were inadequate for its scale, complexity and risk,"" said the project. ""The BBC did not appoint a senior responsible owner to act as a single point of accountability and align all elements of the DMI. Reporting arrangements were not fit for purpose.""

Although a deterioration in risk rating had been reported to the BBC's finance board, the report said there was a six-month lag before the executive board was told in June 2012, and a further month delay before the BBC Trust was informed.

Problems discovered too late

The BBC spent an estimated £125.9m on DMI with £98.4m of that written off. At its height over the doomed six-year project, 184 BBC staff and contractors were working on the project.

""Confusion about the content of technology releases and protracted problems with getting the system to work contributed to a growing gap between technology development and what system users expected,"" the NAO concluded.

""The level of assurance and scrutiny that the BBC executive applied to the DMI was insufficient for a high value and strategically important programme that involved significant risks.

""The BBC executive did not have a sufficient grip of the programme and did not appear to appreciate the extent of the problems until a late stage. If the BBC had established better governance and reporting for the DMI it would likely have recognised the difficulties much earlier.""

Thousands of veterans may have had their personal information broadcast online following a major ""defect"" on a popular benefits website run by the Defense and Veterans Affairs departments.

According to multiple complaints, veterans who logged onto the eBenefits site to check personal claims and benefits information were redirected to other veterans' files.

“I went into my folder to check on the status of my claim and it said ‘sexual trauma’,” one veteran told FoxNews.com on Tuesday. “It definitely was not mine. There were also lines of erroneous web code. You could tell there was a coding software error.”

The veteran, who has a computer background and asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation, said he then logged off the site completely, but again encountered the same error.

“I logged off, logged back in and it was the same thing,” he said. “Every time I’d log back in, I would get another person’s information.”

Names, addresses, bank routing numbers and medical conditions – both current and past -- were among the information made available via the data breach last week.

The VA issued a statement Friday afternoon acknowledging the “software defect.”

“VA took immediate action upon discovering the software defect and shut the eBenefits system down in order to limit any problems,” the agency said.

It also said that the VA’s independent Data Breach Core Team would conduct a full review and that based on the number affected by the problem, the VA “will take the appropriate response, which may include free credit monitoring for the affected individuals.”

An official said up to 5,351 people may have been impacted, out of a total 3.38 million users. A ""final determination"" on the number affected has not yet been made.

This isn’t the first time the VA has had a problem with privacy – in 2012, thousands of veterans had their personal information compromised when data was released to Ancestry.com, and posted.

In 2009, the VA agreed to pay $20 million to veterans for exposing them to possible identity theft in 2006 by losing their sensitive personal information.

The settlement was part of a class-action law suit filed by five veterans groups accusing the government of invasion of privacy.

In 2006, a VA data analyst said he had lost a laptop and external drive containing the names and Social Security numbers of as many as 26.5 million veterans and active-duty military men and women.

The laptop that contained the information was later found intact but the damage had been done. The VA inspector general report that followed harshly criticized both the data analyst and his supervisors for putting veterans as risk.",,2023-10-19 15:40:45.826441+00:00,True,True,True,,0.7808448618345288,'Defect' on VA benefits site shares vets' personal details online - Fox News,"Major ""Defect"" on eBenefits Website Exposes Veterans' Personal Information","The software failure incident occurred on the eBenefits website, which is run by the Defense and Veterans Affairs departments.

Days after a California driver escaped a traffic conviction over wearing Google Glass behind the wheel, the search company's augmented-reality device is once again testing the law. On Saturday, an Ohio man was detained for several hours by federal agents who suspected him of recording ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" in his local movie theater using Glass's video function.

""About an hour into the movie,"" Columbus-based Tiberiu Ungureanu told The Gadgeteer, ""a guy comes near my seat, shoves a badge that had some sort of a shield on it, yanks the Google Glass off my face and says, 'follow me outside immediately.'""

What followed was a lengthy interview that ended only when Ungureanu convinced an agent to search his device for evidence of the offending footage. There was none.

While Ungureanu initially suspected his interrogators to be officers from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, they later turned out to be agents from the Department of Homeland Security — specifically, from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement department, which deals with international piracy cases in collaboration with the movie industry. In this case, officials from the Motion Picture Association of America, who were already at the theater, contacted ICE when they learned that someone was in the audience with a recording device.

""On Jan. 18, special agents with ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations and local authorities briefly interviewed a man suspected of using an electronic recording device to record a film at an AMC theater in Columbus,"" Khaalid Walls, an ICE spokesman, told The Washington Post on Tuesday. ""The man, who voluntarily answered questions, confirmed to authorities that the suspected recording device was also a pair of prescription eye glasses in which the recording function had been inactive. No further action was taken.""

ICE has taken a prominent role in Washington's global anti-piracy efforts, even going so far as to publish a public service announcement on YouTube and linking to it from various file sharing domains that it's seized.

In confirming the FBI's non-involvement in Ungureanu's detention, an agency spokesman added that Ungureanu actually works with the FBI on occasion.

""Incidentally, we have a positive relationship with the person involved, and they contacted us,"" said Todd Lindgren, an FBI public affairs officer based in Cincinnati. ""He's a routine liaison who works in the cyber field, and some of our cyber agents had a relationship with the guy.""

Share this article Share

The MPAA did not immediately respond to calls and an e-mail requesting comment. Nor did Ungureanu himself.

""While we're huge fans of technology and innovation, wearing a device that has the capability to record video is not appropriate at the movie theater,"" said Ryan Noonan, a spokesman for AMC.

The incident offers a teaser for the kind of legal troubles Glass could cause not just on the highways but in other public settings where electronics are prohibited. It also suggests a privacy paradox for Glass users in that, to absolve themselves of suspicion might require consenting to a search, one that could lead authorities to dig through sensitive or personal data. And while the issue of warrantless device searches has reached the Supreme Court, whatever ruling comes down will apply only to cellphones. Google Glass users will likely have a lot more experiences like Ungureanu's before they get anything resembling legal clarity.

Update: In an e-mailed statement, the MPAA tells me it doesn't find Google Glass objectionable — yet. ""Google Glass is an incredible innovation in the mobile sphere, and we have seen no proof that it is currently a significant threat that could result in content theft.""",,2023-10-19 15:51:31.302676+00:00,True,False,,,,This Google Glass user went to the movies.

24326,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/25/apples-ssl-iphone-vulnerability-how-did-it-happen-and-what-next,2014-02-25 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2014-02-25 00:00:00. Apple has issued an urgent fix for a vulnerability in its SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) code, used to create secure connections to websites over Wi-Fi or other connections, for its iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch devices.

The fix, which is available now for both iOS 6 and iOS 7, is for a flaw which appears to have been introduced in a code change made ahead of the launch of iOS 6.0.

The flaw also affects Mac computers running Mac OSX - for which there’s no fix announced yet, although Apple says one is “coming soon”. Update: the fix is included in OSX 10.9.2, which became available on Tuesday. There is also an update for Mountain Lion, though it’s not clear why as that wasn’t thought to be affected.

The bug, and its discovery, raise a number of questions. Here’s what we do know, what we don’t know, and what we hope to know. (Apple declined to comment in relation to a number of questions we put about the vulnerability.)

How can I check whether I’m vulnerable?

Go to gotofail.com and see what message you get. If all is good you’ll get a green message. On an iOS device, you’ll get a warning to update. If you’re on a Mac, you’ll either get a green message (your system is safe) or a yellow message (in a safe browser pointing out that other apps could be vulnerable) or a red message (telling you to patch your browser).

What should I do?

If you use an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch, update its operating software. Go to Settings -> General -> Software Update. For devices using iOS 7, update to iOS 7.0.6; for devices on iOS 6 which can’t be updated to iOS 7 (the iPhone 3GS or iPod Touch 4G), update to 6.1.6.

Note that Apple isn’t offering an update to iOS 6 for devices which can be updated to iOS 7 (iPhone 4, iPad 2, etc). For those, your only options are to update, or live dangerously.

If you’re using a Mac on an older OS version, ie 10.8 (”Mountain Lion”) or earlier, you’re safe.

If you’re using a Mac on the newest OS, 10.9 (aka “Mavericks”), don’t use Safari to connect to secure websites until there’s an update. Use Mozilla’s Firefox or Google’s Chrome: they use their own code for connecting to secure websites. No bug has been found in that.

What did the bug do?

In theory (and perhaps, depending on who knew about it, in practice) it could allow your connections to secure sites to be spied on and/or your login details captured. Updating the software prevents that. The bug affected the SSL/TLS encrypted connection to remote sites.

What’s the importance of SSL/TLS?

When your device (handheld or PC) connects to a website using the SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) method, the site presents a cryptographic “certificate” chain identifying itself and the authority which issued the certificate. Your device already has a list of issuing authorities which are trusted, and it will check the name of the site and the certificate it presents with that authority.

It’s a four-step process:

Site presents certificate chain

Your device checks site’s certificate matches name of site you’re on

Your device verifies that certificate comes from valid issuing authority

Your browser verifies that certificate chain signature matches the site’s public key.

(There’s also a guide to how it works at the gotofail.com FAQ.)

In theory, a certificate that has the wrong name for the site, or which hasn’t been issued by the authority, or which is out of date, won’t be trusted. At this point you’ll get a warning in your browser telling you that there’s something wrong and that you shouldn’t proceed or your data could be at risk.

A faked certificate could mean that the site you’re connecting to is actually being run by someone who wants to collect your user login details - as has happened in Iran. In 2011 the government there is reckoned to have used a certificate issued from a subverted certificated authority to set up a site which (through DNS diversion) could pretend to be Google’s gmail.com - and captured the data from dissidents who thought they were logging into the site.

So it’s important that your device can authenticate SSL certificates correctly. Sometimes you will come across sites where you get a certificate warning but which say you should trust it (for example because it’s a subsidiary with a different name from the one which owns the certificate). Be wary. Don’t approve certificates without being cautious.

What was the bug?

Due to a singe repeated line of code in an Apple library, almost any attempt to verify a certificate on a site would succeed - whether or not the certificate’s signature was valid. It would only throw an error if the certificate itself was invalid (due to being out of date, for example).

The bug is in the code below: it’s the second “goto fail;”, and would be carried out in every circumstance.

static OSStatus

SSLVerifySignedServerKeyExchange(SSLContext *ctx, bool isRsa, SSLBuffer signedParams,

uint8_t *signature, UInt16 signatureLen)

{

OSStatus err;

...

if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&hashCtx, &serverRandom)) != 0)

goto fail;

if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&hashCtx, &signedParams)) != 0)

goto fail;

goto fail;

if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.final(&hashCtx, &hashOut)) != 0)

goto fail;

...

fail:

SSLFreeBuffer(&signedHashes);

SSLFreeBuffer(&hashCtx);

return err;

}

When did the bug appear?

The diff of the two code versions shows the addition of the extra statement at line 62:

Apple's SSL/TLS verification code, showing the differences between versions. The red lines were removed in the update; the green lines were added. The crucial change which broke SSL is line 62. Photograph: Public domain Photograph: Public domain

(The red lines are removed in the updated code; the green lines are added.)

It’s not an obvious difference unless you’re looking for it; in that case, it stands out like a sore thumb to any programmer.

How did the bug get there?

Arguing against the conspiracy plan is the fact that Apple publishes this code on its open source page. On the basis that “many eyes make bugs shallow”, and that the whole internet has been able to look at this epic “goto fail” for ages. If the NSA puts its secret backdoors out in the open like this, you’d expect them to be found a lot faster.

Arguing for nefarious conspiracy is - well, not very much. Apple should have found it, but didn’t; either of its compilers (GCC and Clang) should have thrown an error, but testing by others has shown that it doesn’t unless you have a particular warning flag (for “unreachable code”) set. A compiler which pointed to “unreachable code” (that is, a segment of code which will never be activated because it lies beneath a code diversion that always applies) would have caught it.

One former Apple staffer who worked on Mac OSX told the Guardian it’s “extremely unlikely, at least under normal circumstances” that the flaw was added maliciously. “There are very few people on any given team at Apple, and so getting changes lost in the shuffle would be difficult. The flip side is that there aren’t strong internal consistency/integrity checks on the codebase, so if someone were clever enough to subvert normal processes there would be easy ways in.”

But, the programmer added, “this change does not specifically stand out as malicious in nature.” The way it almost certainly happened is that it was a copy/paste error, or a merge issue (between two branches of code) that went unnoticed - “two similar changes could cause a conflict” (where the code has an illogical flow) “and in resolving this conflict an engineer might have made a mistake.”

What do programmers say?

One former Apple employee who worked on Mac OSX, including shipping updates and security updates, told the Guardian that Apple will be able to identify who did the code checkin which created the bug. “While source code management is on a team-by-team basis (there’s no company-wide policy), nearly every team uses some system (Git or SVN) that would be able to track commits [changes to code which are “committed” for use] and assign blame.”

The most likely explanation is that it occurred through the merging of two branches of code (where two or more people were working on the segment of code). Code merging is completely common in professional programming; reconciling conflicts between separate branches tends to be done by hand, using editors which will show up “diffs” (differences) between the old, new, and alternative new code.

Adam Langley, who works on security for Google’s Chrome browser (but hasn’t worked for Apple), says:

This sort of subtle bug deep in the code is a nightmare. I believe that it’s just a mistake and I feel very bad for whomever might have slipped in an editor and created it.

The author of the gotofail.com site thinks otherwise:

It is hard for me to believe that the second “goto fail;” was inserted accidently given that there were no other changes within a few lines of it. In my opinion, the bug is too easy to exploit for it to have been an NSA plant. My speculation is that someone put it in on purpose so they (or their buddy) could sell it.

(By “sell” he’s referring to the fact that you can now sell “zero-day exploits” to nation states and security companies - garnering up to half a million dollars or perhaps more.)

The fact that Apple is fixing the hole now suggests that it isn’t NSA-inspired. Though as John Gruber has pointed out, it’s perfectly possible that the NSA discovered this hole when iOS 6 was released and knew that it could exploit it.

One peculiar fact: if the NSA was aware of this security hole, it doesn’t seem to have told the US Department of Defense, which passed iOS 6 for use in government in May 2013.

When did Apple find the bug?

Apple seems then to have begun working on the fix and how to roll it out. What’s odd is that despite finding the vulnerability then, it didn’t fix it in two beta versions of iOS 7.1 that were released after that time. One possibility - though the company won’t confirm this - is that it discovered the failure to authenticate the certificate in January, but took until now to narrow down the faulty piece of code - although given how quickly it took the rest of the web to do the same (a matter of a few hours) this seems unlikely.

Why didn’t Apple spot the bug sooner?

How did Apple find the bug?

But Paget (who has just started working for Tesla) has unleashed a blistering attack on Apple on her blog for releasing the fix for iOS but not also patching the desktop at the same time:

WHAT THE EVER LOVING F**K, APPLE??!?!! Did you seriously just use one of your platforms to drop an SSL 0day on your other platform? As I sit here on my mac I’m vulnerable to this and there’s nothing I can do, because you couldn’t release a patch for both platforms at the same time? You do know there’s a bunch of live, working exploits for this out in the wild right now, right?

As she points out, Apple’s own security update system uses SSL - so might that be hacked by a “man in the middle” attack to plant malware?

How about your update system itself – is that vulnerable? Come the hell on, Apple. You just dropped an ugly 0day [zero-day vulnerability] on us and then went home for the weekend – goto fail indeed. FIX. YOUR. SHIT.

Why didn’t Apple fix the bug for Mac OSX at the same time as it did for iOS?

It certainly should have, as Paget points out. Another former Apple staffer agrees; apparently Apple decided instead to roll out the fix for Mavericks as part of its 10.9.2 software update rather than as a separate security update (which it has done before). But other bugs were found in 10.9.2, delaying its release - and reducing the security of Mac users. (As noted above, the fix for OSX was rolled out on Tuesday, four days after that for iOS.)

Have there been mistakes like this before?

Mistakes abound in software - and encryption mistakes are surprisingly easy to make. In May 2011, a security researcher pointed out that WhatsApp user accounts could be hijacked because they weren’t encrypted at all; until September 2011, there was a flaw in the same app which let people send forged messages pretending to be from anyone.

A common mistake is the use of default logins which are left active: millions of routers around the world have default user IDs and passwords (often “admin” and “admin”) which can be exploited by hackers.

A similar coding mistake bricked Microsoft’s Zune on the last day of 2008 - which, as luck would have it, was a leap year. There was a coding mistake in the software for the timer chip which wouldn’t allow it to display a date equivalent to the 366th day of the year.

Apple has also made some similar egregious errors - notably in having alarms which didn’t adjust when daylight savings time did, and so kept waking people up either an hour early or late.

Google too had an error in version 4.2.0 of its Android software: you couldn’t add the birthdays of people born in December to their contacts, because that month wasn’t included.

More seriously, versions of Google’s Android up to version 4.2 could see connections made over open Wi-Fi hijacked and malicious code injected, UK-based MWR Labs said in September 2013. It’s unclear whether that has yet been patched; millions of Android devices are still using versions below 4.2. Ars Technica, reporting that flaw, noted that “while the weakness can largely be prevented in Android 4.2, users are protected only if developers of each app follow best practices.”

And Microsoft had a long-running flaw in Windows 95 and Windows 98 which meant that if your computer had been running continuously for just under 50 days, it would suddenly hang - and you’d have to reboot it. Why? Because it measured “uptime” using a 32-bit register, which incremented every millisecond. After 2^32 milliseconds (aka 49 days and 17 hours), the register was all 1s - and the only way to reset it was turning the power off. That’s quite aside from the many flaws exploited in its ActiveX software to install malicious programs on Windows machines in so-called “drive-by installations”.

What lessons are there from this?

In the words of Arie Van Deursen, professor in software engineering at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands,

When first seeing this code, I was once again caught by how incredibly brittle programming is. Just adding a single line of code can bring a system to its knees.

Not only that - but the flawed code has been both used and published for 18 months, and tested by a government security organisation which passed it for use. Software bugs can be pernicious - and they can lurk in the most essential areas. And even companies which have been writing software for decades can fall foul of them.

But the former staffer at Apple says that unless the company introduces better testing regimes - static code analysis, unit testing, regression testing - “I’m not surprised by this… it will only be a matter of time until another bomb like this hits.” The only - minimal - comfort: “I doubt it is malicious.”

Feeling smug that your iPhone can’t be hacked? Not so fast...",,2023-10-19 16:59:27.440479+00:00,True,True,False,,,"Apple's SSL iPhone vulnerability: how did it happen, and what next? - The Guardian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24408,https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/apples-culture-of-secrecy-delays-security-response-again/,2014-02-25 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnet.com,,"Published on None. If it wasn't for the news reports of Apple's ""goto fail"" fix released on Tuesday, you might not have known that there had been a security problem with your Macs.

More than a decade ago, Microsoft was notorious for ignoring security problems. Years of complaints from independent security researchers and industry professionals resulted in big changes in how the company handles security problems.

After Windows security measures repeatedly fell to malicious hackers, and the company was in danger of becoming the laughingstock of the security community, Chairman Bill Gates wrote a now-famous 2002 letter saying security would become the company's top priority. By contrast, neither Tim Cook nor Steve Jobs have ever reformed Apple's mission in the same way.

In today's update that fixes ""goto fail,"" Apple buried the notification of the fix and didn't identify it as being any different from the other security fixes in the update. Apple credited German software developer Roland Moriz for one of the bugs identified, although it appears that the CURL database bug he reported in November is only related to the ""goto fail"" bug and not identical.

""It looks like Apple may have some problems [rolling] out security patches when they already have another regular release in queue,"" Moriz wrote to CNET in an e-mail. ""After this disaster, Apple should improve the test coverage of certain critical parts (e.g. SecureTransport) and review the existing code base.""

The problem may be even worse in this case than it looks. ""One interesting aspect of this is that [Mac OS X] 10.9.2 patched a large number of serious security vulnerabilities, not just the notorious ""goto fail"" one,"" said longtime Apple software developer Mike Ash, who described the list of bugs as ""arguably more significant"" than the Transport Layer Security problems in ""goto fail.""

""Some of them would allow an attacker to compromise your machine just by having you visit a Web site they control,"" he said, also known as a drive-by attack. Emphasizing that he was speculating on Apple's reasoning for the way that the update was published, Ash said in an e-mail to CNET that Apple may have decided ""to roll the TLS fix into 10.9.2 because they needed to put 10.9.2 out soon to fix these other vulnerabilities, and a separate patch would have delayed it.""

The evidence points to problems at Apple with alerting its users and fixing flaws in a timely manner. This is problematic because it's not made clear to Mac and iPhone users how important an update is to their security.

By contrast, Google and Microsoft identify security fixes with standard terminology such as Medium, High, and Critical.

""They think that -- except for a small community -- that people don't care about security and privacy. They want to talk more about speed and cup holders and less about airbags,"" he said, ""but it's the airbags that will save you."" <br>--Ashkan Soltani, independent security researcher

It took Apple more than 1,200 days to fix a vulnerability in 2011 exploited by the FinFisher trojan. An App Store flaw that attackers exploited to steal passwords and surreptitiously install malicious apps was remedied by simply turning on basic HTTPS encryption -- nine months after it was initially reported. The Flashback malware infected more than 600,000 Macs, more than 1 percent of all Macs in use worldwide, because Apple took two months longer than Oracle to issue its own Java patch.

When issuing security updates, timeliness matters. Security researcher Ashkan Soltani said he thinks the culture at Apple downplays security concerns.

""They think that -- except for a small community -- that people don't care about security and privacy. They want to talk more about speed and cup holders and less about airbags,"" he said, ""but it's the airbags that will save you.""

Part of the problem is that companies like Apple think they can protect users by keeping knowledge of vulnerabilities from the public, said Andrew Sudbury, the chief technology officer at security startup Abine.

""Apple's security is still tied to its image,"" he said. ""You'd think you'd want to push something like this as hard and as quickly as possible, but I personally only found out about it through the news.""

""Apple's security is still tied to its image. You'd think you'd want to push something like this as hard and as quickly as possible, but I personally only found out about it through the news."" <br>--Andrew Sudbury, CTO at security startup Abine

Apple could have fixed the ""goto fail"" problem faster, but didn't. ""I don't get the impression that the five-day delay was strictly necessary. Apple has put out quick security updates in the past, and this fix was particularly easy to apply at least in theory,"" said Ash.

Sudbury added that the bigger issue at Apple is keeping iPhones and iPads secure.

""iOS devices are a consumer device, and there's nothing you as a user can do [to secure them.] Apple takes all their responsibility, and even security companies can't help you,"" he said.

Soltani didn't mince his words for Cook's crew in Cupertino. ""[They] waited until they had all the pieces together for a minor update, 10.9.2. If it were me, the moment something like this was determined, you'd want to roll this out. It was one line [of code required to fix the ""goto"" bug.]""

""Instead,"" he said, ""they waited an entire weekend or more.""

Apple did not respond to a request for comment before this story was published. CNET will update the story when there's more information.

With its history of lengthy response times to critical security problems, Apple is equally long overdue for a serious re-evaluation of how they handle their insecurities.

It's not just teens that sext: HALF of adults have sent X-rated messages – and 16% have sent them to a STRANGER

McAfee’s latest study found over half of Britons who have sent or received intimate or sexually explicit content still have it stored on their mobile



But one in three people do not secure their smartphone with a password



More than three quarters of sexts are sent to partners and young people are most likely to send and receive explicit messages

Almost 60 per cent admitted to have digital sexual encounters with people they weren't in a relationship with. Stock image pictured

As Valentine’s Day approaches, a study has revealed that one in four Britons will be sending a racy message or explicit photo to their partner.

But lovers may want to think twice before hitting send on intimate content, according to one internet security provider, which says that many phones containing sexual content are insecure.

New research reveals that just over half of adults who have exchanged intimate or sexually explicit content still have it stored on their mobile device, despite the fact that one in three do not even have the most basic password protection on their smartphones.



Of those that do have protection, just over 40 per cent use the same details for multiple internet connected devices, increasing the likelihood these devices will be hacked.



Shockingly, the U.S. version of the study also revealed that 16 per cent of Americans have sent a sext to a stranger, increasing the risk of reputational ruin.



One in three people in the UK share personal passwords with a spouse or significant other.



However despite this trust, almost half of those surveyed confessed to logging in to their partners’ social or app profiles and using their password to snoop on the photos and messages being exchanged.



'In this era of the ""always on"" consumer, the rules around privacy in dating have lost some social potency,' said Samantha Swift, Online Safety Expert at McAfee.



Nearly half of those surveyed admitted to having rifled through a partner’s private online accounts.



In an age when sharing content with thousands can take a matter of seconds, the risk of personal content leaking online has never been higher and whether a partner is trusted or not it’s vital to protect yourself and your devices,' she added.

One in three people in the UK share personal passwords (illustrated) with a spouse or significant other and 96 per cent trust their other half not to post intimate messages or sexts online

A U.S. study by the Californian security software firm found that while more than three quarters of sexts are sent to partners, 16 per cent of people have sent risqué material to a complete stranger.

WHAT THE SURVEY FOUND OUT

A quarter of those surveyed plan to send a racy message or explicit photo to their partner this Valentine's Day

55% of people who have sent or received X-rated messages still have it stored on their mobile device, despite the fact that one in three don't have even basic password protection on their smartphones

The U.S. version of the study also revealed that 16 percent of Americans have sent a sext to a stranger.

A third of people in the UK share personal passwords with a spouse or significant other and 96 per cent trust their other half not to post intimate messages or sexts online.

But despite this trust, almost 50 per cent of those surveyed confessed to snooping on their partner's messages.

Andy Jones, relationship expert and a former dating columnist said of the findings: 'We live in a risqué age, where celebrity sexting scandals are two a penny and snaps of private body parts go viral overnight.



'Behind every media leak, from Prince Harry’s infamous night in Vegas to Scarlett Johansson naked selfies, is a smartphone.



'We’re a generation living with digital baggage, whether you’re the victim of a hack or a vengeful lover, pictures leaked online last a lifetime. As a rule of thumb, if it’s something you wouldn’t want your family to see you probably shouldn’t share it!'

Slightly fewer U.S. citizens (45 per cent) have stored racy pictures on their phones that their UK peers and approximately 70 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds have been sent a sext.



Around a third of Americans do not protect their phone with a password.

‘Now, that's just asking for a social scandal,’ McAfee's Robert Siciliano wrote in a blog post.

Furthermore, 40 per cent of Americans have also shared their bank details with a partner.

New research reveals that 55 per cent of Britons who have sent or received intimate or sexually explicit content still have it stored on their mobile device - and many of them do not protect their device with a password leaving themselves open to embarrassment and upset if the pictures are released

While almost all of the 1,500 U.S. adults surveyed said they trust their significant other with intimate content they have sent, only a third have asked their partner to delete the information at the end of a relationship, raising the threat of a reputation sabotage by a vengeful ex.

Gary Davis, vice president of McAfee consumer business, said: ‘With all the stories we’ve heard about intimate photos being leaked, it’s hard to believe people are still sharing their passwords.’



‘Ultimately, they’re increasing the risks of these photos becoming public and possibly jeopardising their identity and reputation. Consumers must take precautions and use mobile security to ensure that what should be private stays private.’



The firm has advised people not to share passwords for their mobiles with others and to keep their content secure by avoiding using weak passwords that can be easily guessed, such as birthdays or numbers in a row.",,2023-10-19 17:05:22.929831+00:00,True,False,,,,HALF of adults have sent X-rated 'sext' mobile phone messages - Daily Mail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hacking group announced the exploit on Friday, showing several screenshots of the Wordpress-based backend of the Forbes.com Web site. The organization said in a tweet that more than 1 million user e-mails and passwords were successfully stolen and will be published at some point.

Forbes acknowledged that its Web site and publishing platform were the targets of a hack in a Facebook post on Friday. The company said e-mail addresses may have been exposed but passwords are encrypted. Still, Forbes cautioned readers and contributors to change their passwords as a precaution:

Security message: Forbes.com was targeted in a digital attack and our publishing platform was compromised. Users' email addresses may have been exposed. The passwords were encrypted, but as a precaution, we strongly encourage Forbes readers and contributors to change their passwords on our system, and encourage them to change them on other websites if they use the same password elsewhere. We have notified law enforcement. We take this matter very seriously and apologize to the members of our community for this breach.

IBTimes, which earlier reported on the story, talked to a spokesperson for the SEA, who said the attacks are based in its belief that Forbes' ""hate for Syria is very clear and flagrant in their articles.""

In addition to stealing usernames, the Syrian Electronic Army posted an article on the site entitled ""Hacked by the Syrian Electronic Army."" That article has since been taken down, and there don't appear to be any other posts on the site that have come from the Syrian Electronic Army.

The Syrian Electronic Army is one of the more active hacking groups. Last year, the organization hacked into Viber's database, hijacked a Thomson Reuters Twitter feed, and took aim at both the Onion and BBC Twitter accounts.

According to security firm Sophos, it has discovered several applications claiming to be Flappy Bird in third-party Android app marketplaces. The trouble, however, is that the games in some cases contain malware and in others force users to send a text message to a given number, effectively giving the malware creators all they need to potentially exploit users.

Another security firm, Trend Micro, also chimed in on the issue, saying that it has discovered ""a bunch of fake Android Flappy Bird apps spreading online."" Every one of those it has discovered so far are ""apps that send messages to premium numbers, thus causing unwanted changes to victims' phone billing statements.""

Flappy Bird has become a hot-button issue in the mobile world after the game soared to popularity and was subsequently taken down by its creator, Dong Nguyen. That was the opening malware creators needed, the security firms say, to take advantage of users who didn't have a chance to try out the game and want to see what all the hype is about.

Both Trend Micro and Sophos said that users shouldn't attempt to download anything calling itself Flappy Bird, since the original version is ""dead."" They also warned users to ""be wary of apps from alternative markets.""

WASHINGTON — Intelligence officials investigating how Edward J. Snowden gained access to a huge trove of the country’s most highly classified documents say they have determined that he used inexpensive and widely available software to “scrape” the National Security Agency’s networks, and kept at it even after he was briefly challenged by agency officials. Using “web crawler” software designed to search, index and back up a website, Mr. Snowden “scraped data out of our systems” while he went about his day job, according to a senior intelligence official. “We do not believe this was an individual sitting at a machine and downloading this much material in sequence,” the official said. The process, he added, was “quite automated.”  The findings are striking because the N.S.A.’s mission includes protecting the nation’s most sensitive military and intelligence computer systems from cyberattacks, especially the sophisticated attacks that emanate from Russia and China. Mr. Snowden’s “insider attack,” by contrast, was hardly sophisticated and should have been easily detected, investigators found.  Moreover, Mr. Snowden succeeded nearly three years after the WikiLeaks disclosures, in which military and State Department files, of far less sensitivity, were taken using similar techniques.  Mr. Snowden had broad access to the N.S.A.’s complete files because he was working as a technology contractor for the agency in Hawaii, helping to manage the agency’s computer systems in an outpost that focuses on China and North Korea. A web crawler, also called a spider, automatically moves from website to website, following links embedded in each document, and can be programmed to copy everything in its path.  Mr. Snowden appears to have set the parameters for the searches, including which subjects to look for and how deeply to follow links to documents and other data on the N.S.A.’s internal networks. Intelligence officials told a House hearing last week that he accessed roughly 1.7 million files.  Among the materials prominent in the Snowden files are the agency’s shared “wikis,” databases to which intelligence analysts, operatives and others contributed their knowledge. Some of that material indicates that Mr. Snowden “accessed” the documents. But experts say they may well have been downloaded not by him but by the program acting on his behalf.  Agency officials insist that if Mr. Snowden had been working from N.S.A. headquarters at Fort Meade, Md., which was equipped with monitors designed to detect when a huge volume of data was being accessed and downloaded, he almost certainly would have been caught. But because he worked at an agency outpost that had not yet been upgraded with modern security measures, his copying of what the agency’s newly appointed No. 2 officer, Rick Ledgett, recently called “the keys to the kingdom” raised few alarms.  “Some place had to be last” in getting the security upgrade, said one official familiar with Mr. Snowden’s activities. But he added that Mr. Snowden’s actions had been “challenged a few times.”  Image Officials say Mr. Snowden used “web crawler” software. Credit... Channel 4/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images In at least one instance when he was questioned, Mr. Snowden provided what were later described to investigators as legitimate-sounding explanations for his activities: As a systems administrator he was responsible for conducting routine network maintenance. That could include backing up the computer systems and moving information to local servers, investigators were told. But from his first days working as a contractor inside the N.S.A.’s aging underground Oahu facility for Dell, the computer maker, and then at a modern office building on the island for Booz Allen Hamilton, the technology consulting firm that sells and operates computer security services used by the government, Mr. Snowden learned something critical about the N.S.A.’s culture: While the organization built enormously high electronic barriers to keep out foreign invaders, it had rudimentary protections against insiders.  “Once you are inside the assumption is that you are supposed to be there, like in most organizations,” said Richard Bejtlich, the chief security strategist for FireEye, a Silicon Valley computer security firm, and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “But that doesn’t explain why they weren’t more vigilant about excessive activity in the system.”  Investigators have yet to answer the question of whether Mr. Snowden happened into an ill-defended outpost of the N.S.A. or sought a job there because he knew it had yet to install the security upgrades that might have stopped him. “He was either very lucky or very strategic,” one intelligence official said. A new book, “The Snowden Files,” by Luke Harding, a correspondent for The Guardian in London, reports that Mr. Snowden sought his job at Booz Allen because “to get access to a final tranche of documents” he needed “greater security privileges than he enjoyed in his position at Dell.”  Through his lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, Mr. Snowden did not specifically address the government’s theory of how he obtained the files, saying in a statement: “It’s ironic that officials are giving classified information to journalists in an effort to discredit me for giving classified information to journalists. The difference is that I did so to inform the public about the government’s actions, and they’re doing so to misinform the public about mine.” The N.S.A. declined to comment on its investigation or the security changes it has made since the Snowden disclosures. Other intelligence officials familiar with the findings of the investigations underway — there are at least four — were granted anonymity to discuss the investigations. In interviews, officials declined to say which web crawler Mr. Snowden had used, or whether he had written some of the software himself. Officials said it functioned like Googlebot, a widely used web crawler that Google developed to find and index new pages on the web. What officials cannot explain is why the presence of such software in a highly classified system was not an obvious tip-off to unauthorized activity. When inserted with Mr. Snowden’s passwords, the web crawler became especially powerful. Investigators determined he probably had also made use of the passwords of some colleagues or supervisors. But he was also aided by a culture within the N.S.A., officials say, that “compartmented” relatively little information. As a result, a 29-year-old computer engineer, working from a World War II-era tunnel in Oahu and then from downtown Honolulu, had access to unencrypted files that dealt with information as varied as the bulk collection of domestic phone numbers and the intercepted communications of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and dozens of other leaders.

Michael Reynolds/European Pressphoto Agency Officials say web crawlers are almost never used on the N.S.A.’s internal systems, making it all the more inexplicable that the one used by Mr. Snowden did not set off alarms as it copied intelligence and military documents stored in the N.S.A.’s systems and linked through the agency’s internal equivalent of Wikipedia.  The answer, officials and outside experts say, is that no one was looking inside the system in Hawaii for hard-to-explain activity. “The N.S.A. had the solution to this problem in hand, but they simply didn’t push it out fast enough,” said James Lewis, a computer expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who has talked extensively with intelligence officials about how the Snowden experience could have been avoided.  Nonetheless, the government had warning that it was vulnerable to such attacks. Similar techniques were used by Chelsea Manning, then known as Pfc. Bradley Manning, who was convicted of turning documents and videos over to WikiLeaks in 2010.  Evidence presented during Private Manning’s court-martial for his role as the source for large archives of military and diplomatic files given to WikiLeaks revealed that he had used a program called “wget” to download the batches of files. That program automates the retrieval of large numbers of files, but it is considered less powerful than the tool Mr. Snowden used.  The program’s use prompted changes in how secret information is handled at the State Department, the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies, but recent assessments suggest that those changes may not have gone far enough. For example, arguments have broken out about whether the N.S.A.’s data should all be encrypted “at rest” — when it is stored in servers — to make it harder to search and steal. But that would also make it harder to retrieve for legitimate purposes.  Investigators have found no evidence that Mr. Snowden’s searches were directed by a foreign power, despite suggestions to that effect by the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan, in recent television appearances and at a hearing last week. But that leaves open the question of how Mr. Snowden chose the search terms to obtain his trove of documents, and why, according to James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, they yielded a disproportionately large number of documents detailing American military movements, preparations and abilities around the world.  In his statement, Mr. Snowden denied any deliberate effort to gain access to any military information. “They rely on a baseless premise, which is that I was after military information,” Mr. Snowden said. The head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, told lawmakers last week that Mr. Snowden’s disclosures could tip off adversaries to American military tactics and operations, and force the Pentagon to spend vast sums to safeguard against that. But he admitted a great deal of uncertainty about what Mr. Snowden possessed.  “Everything that he touched, we assume that he took,” said General Flynn, including details of how the military tracks terrorists, of enemies’ vulnerabilities and of American defenses against improvised explosive devices. He added, “We assume the worst case.” ",,2023-10-19 17:25:16.773520+00:00,True,True,False,,,Snowden Used Low-Cost Tool to Best N.S.A.

Here's something we  haven't seen before: security camera recorders hacked and used to mine bitcoin. The issue was  first reported  by Johannes Ullrich, an instructor at the SANS Technology Institute -- a computer security training organization. Last Friday, he discovered malicious software infecting the Hikvision DVRs used to record video from security cameras. The malware jumps from device to device, trying to infect any other machines it can find on the network. But it also tries to earn a little scratch for its creators by mining bitcoins, a processor-intensive activity that would probably slow down any infected DVR. Though this is a novel method, it's hardly the first time hackers have tried to bust their way into other people's hardware in order to make some bitcoin, the popular digital currency. The bitcoin system is run by independent machines spread across the globe, and if you contribute processing power to the system, you receive some bitcoin in return. This is called mining, and hackers often seek to mine using any machines they can gain control of -- including security camera DVRs. Most malicious software is written for Linux or Windows machines, but Ullrich has seen this new malware infect routers and DVRs in the past. That usually happens accidentally when a worm written for a Windows or Linux system spreads to strange devices that happen to be running the same operating system. But here, the malicious code ""was actually complied for the ARM processor that's running these devices, he says, ""so they kind of knew what they were into."" Since Friday, Ullrich has  also spotted the malware running on a router.  He couldn't immediately be reached for comment. The low-powered ARM chip is one of the worst possible processors you could pick for the crypto-heavy calculations that make up bitcoin mining. Last week, we  wrote about some Android malware  that was remarkably ineffective in making money in the crypto currency game. But the fact ARM is being targeted is a  side-effect of the phenomenon known as the Internet of Things . With increasingly powerful computers out on the network, recording video, running our mobile phones, and even operating as thermostats, it's giving hackers a lot of alternatives to their tried and true targets. Although the Hikvision malware could be used to spy on anyone it infects, it doesn't seem to do that. Apparently, all it wants to do is scan the network for other machines to infect and mine bitcoins, Ullrich says. The malicious software seems to spread using the  default  usernames and passwords for the Hikvision devices, which  most people do not change  after setting them up.",,2023-10-19 18:16:27.596682+00:00,True,True,False,,,Hackers Turn Security Camera DVRs Into Worst Bitcoin Miners Ever - WIRED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More than a million Android smartphones are mining cryptocoins without the owners' knowledge, via apps downloaded from Google Play which stealthily incorporate 'hashing' software.

Researchers at security company Trend Micro say they have found at least two apps on the Google Play store, Songs and ""Prized"", which contain code to join any phone that has them to a cryptocoin-mining ""pool"". Each app has had between 1m and 5m downloads, meaning that up to 10m phones might be affected. Songs was still available at the time of publication. An email to the developer had not been answered by time of publication.

The subverted apps seem to include a request to run the mining software within their terms and conditions - meaning that once the user clicks ""OK"" they have in effect given it permission to steal their processing time. Trend Micro criticised ""the murky language and vague terminology"" of the terms and conditions.

The company also discovered bitcoin-mining code hidden in repackaged versions of Football Manager Handheld and TuneIn Radio outside Google Play. There is no suggestion that the ones on the official store are affected.



Trend Micro was expanding on an initial report by security firm G Data International in February, detailing the malware ANDROIDOS_KAGECOIN.HBTB, which uses the modest processing power of individual mobiles to generate or mine bitcoin, dogecoin and litecoin without the knowledge of the owner of the devices it is running on.



ANDROIDOS_KAGECOIN.HBTB works by injecting legitimate cryptocurrency mining code from an existing app into ""repacked"" versions of Android apps.

""The miner is started as a background service once it detects that the affected device is connected to the Internet. By default, it launches the CPU miner to connect to a dynamic domain, which then redirects to an anonymous Dogecoin mining pool,"" explained Trend Micro in a blog post.

The research company Canalys commented that ""negative security PR continues to hurt Google Play's brand image."" Security researchers have continued to discover malware variants targeting Android. But Trend Micro's discovery is one of the most serious, because it involves apps with huge download numbers that are available on Google Play.

As the blog post points out, mining for cryptocoins in the background when a device is connected to the internet (i.e. throughout the day) saps its battery life, while charging it more often will wear it down in the long term.

""Users with phones and tablets that are suddenly charging slowly, running hot, or quickly running out of batteries may want to consider if they have been exposed to this or similar threats,"" suggested the company.

Both G Data and Trend Micro sell security software for Android, so have clear commercial reasons for highlighting malware on the platform in order to attract new customers. This also gives them a good reason to have a clear overview of emerging threats to Android devices.",,2023-10-19 18:20:14.463581+00:00,True,True,False,,,Millions of Android app downloads infected with cryptocoin-mining code - The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We already knew  that the NSA  has weaponized the internet , enabling it to ""shoot"" exploits at anyone it desires. A single web fetch, imitated by an identified target, is sufficient for the NSA to exploit its victim. But the Edward Snowden slides and story published yesterday at  The Intercept  convey a wealth of new detailed information about the NSA's technology and its limitations. First, it's clear that the NSA has settled on a system called QUANTUM as its preferred, if not near-universal, internet exploitation mechanism. QUANTUM is vastly more effective than just sending spam. But since its launch at NSA, the program has clearly suffered from both mission creep and target creep. If NSA only used QUANTUM to attack wannabee terrorists attempting to read Inspire, hardly anyone would object. But instead the agency expanded it greatly, not only in target scope (including its confirmed use against  Belgacom ) but also in functionality. [#contributor: /contributors/593269e39be5e55af6c24ada]|||Nicholas Weaver is a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute and UC Berkeley (though this opinion is his own). He focuses on network security as well as network intrusion detection, defenses for DNS resolvers, and tools for detecting ISP-introduced manipulations of a user's network connection. Weaver received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from U.C. Berkeley.||| Today QUANTUM packs a suite of attack tools, including both DNS injection (upgrading the man-on-the-side to a man-in-the-middle, allowing bogus certificates and similar routines to break SSL) and HTTP injection. That reasonable enough. But it also includes gadgets like a plug-in to inject into MySQL connections, allowing the NSA to quietly mess with the contents of a third-party's database. (This also surprisingly suggests that unencrypted MySQL on the internet is common enough to attract NSA attention.) And it allows the NSA to hijack both IRC and HTTP-based criminal botnets, and also includes routines which use packet-injection to create  phantom servers , and even attempting (poorly) to use this for defense. The reaching can be extensive. The most glaring example is  a QUANTUMDEFENSE  idea that has the NSA wiretaps look for DNS requests for NIPRnet addresses, and packet-inject a bogus DNS reply redirecting the attacker to a NSA controlled site. NIPRNET is the Defense Department's portion of the internet - it's unclassified, and reachable by the public. So QUANTUMDEFENSE is a classic case of ""if all you have is a hammer, all problems look like nails."" The DoD controls the DNS authority record that the attacker is looking up, and could directly send the attacker off on a wild goose chase. Moreover, for all its utility, QUANTUM has three limitations that come through in the slides: classification bureaucracy, a limited implementation, and weaknesses on defense. A previous mystery was how 100 ""tips"" (the wiretap detecting something of interesting and telling another computer about it) would result in only 5 successful ""shots"" (an exploitive packet received by the victim) in one test, and why previous QUANTUM slides showed an obviously broken design where the ""shot"" was executed by a remote computer, adding latency and reducing effectiveness. It turns out this is almost entirely due to classification. The wiretap itself lies on the internet, in  ""system low"" space . The logic behind the attack lives in the NSA's classified, ""system high"" land. It's easy to send data (tips in this case) from system low to system high - from the unclassified internet to the classified NSA network. But by design, going the other way is almost impossible. A special one-way ""diode"" gateway controls the communication to keep information from backwashing out of the classified network. This is the underlying reason for the split design and subsequent poor performance. NSA required the attack logic be in ""system high"" and the rest just flowed from that design decision. The ""system high"" systems needs high protection, may need to be located in a different secure location, and can't just send out requests to the internet. Rather than go through the bureaucratic fight to move the attack logic into ""system low"" (and co-located on the wiretap), the NSA sought to work around it in the case of QUANTUMHAND. Instead of targeting just any web connection for exploitation, it targeted persistent ""push"" connections from Facebook, where a user's browser would leave an idle connection open, waiting for a command from the server. This way, even the slow, broken, classified architecture could exploit Facebook users. Sadly for NSA and GCHQ (and FSB, and DGSE, and every other spy agency), Facebook turned on encryption a few months ago, which should thwart this attack. The second limitation is revealed in the description of  an experiment . The NSA/GCHQ was looking to add ""pwn by keyword"": check if a user's email through Hotmail or Yahoo mail contained any keyword and, if so, exploit them automatically. The agencies conducted and experiment to see if this attack would work. This experiment reveals that the QUANTUMTHEORY wiretaps only look at individual packets, not complete TCP streams, making it a surprisingly limited tool. QUANTUM, at heart, really is  airpwn without the goatse . The final limitation involves  QUANTUMSMACKDOWN , the NSA's plan to use packet injection to block attacks against DoD assets that they were testing. This seems like wishful thinking to me. In order for this to work, the wiretap needs to identify 'evil traffic' headed to a Pentagon network-- a hard problem further compounded by the wiretap's packet-only nature. Even when 'evil' is identified, QUANTUM can only block requests and terminate replies early: By the time QUANTUM decides to terminate a connection (a problem made worse by the classification structure), the damage is likely already done. QUANTUMSMACKDOWN can keep some bottom-feeders off the DoD networks -- but only that, the bottom feeders. Any DoD network infected by such low-level adversaries deserves to be infected, and the contractors responsible fired. Professional adversaries will breeze past the QUANTUMSMACKDOWN like it doesn't exist. Finally, there is the big guide of possible  selectors  an analyst can use for targeting. There has been much back and forth about private companies also doing NSA-like data collection. Yet this single slide shows just how serious this symbiosis has become, with both private companies and the NSA using and exploiting the same information. Most of the data is involved in some form of user tracking. Both the content networks like Google and Facebook as well as numerous ad networks have built a global network of user monitoring, so it's natural that the NSA not only piggybacks off this monitoring but uses it to guide attacks. Behind the scenes, the NSA also performs user-linking, which allows them to fully deanonymize the supposedly ""anonymous"" advertisement cookies. Everything we've seen about QUANTUM and other internet activity can be replicated with a surprisingly moderate budget, using existing tools with just a little modification. The biggest limitation on QUANTUM is location: The attacker must be able to see a request which identifies the target. Since the same techniques can work on a Wi-Fi network, a $50  Raspberry Pi , located in a Foggy Bottom Starbucks, can provide any country, big and small, with a little window of QUANTUM exploitation. A foreign government can perform the QUANTUM attack NSA-style wherever your traffic passes through their country. And that's the bottom line with the NSA's QUANTUM program. The NSA does not have a monopoly on the technology, and their widespread use acts as implicit permission to others, both nation-state and criminal.",,2023-10-19 18:25:37.816094+00:00,True,True,False,,,A Close Look at the NSA's Most Powerful Internet Attack Tool - WIRED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

¿Podrían técnicas matemáticas inspiradas en un clérigo británico del siglo XVIII ayudar a hallar fragmentos del vuelo de Malaysia Airlines MH370?

Este lunes, el primer ministro malasio, Najib Razak, confirmó que el vuelo MH370 ""acabó en el mar"" y descartó que haya sobrevivientes.

Sin embargo, la búsqueda de los restos del aparato y de la caja negra, que daría las claves de las circunstancias que llevaron a la desaparición del avión, continúa.

Una tarea difícil en la que las matemáticas podrían tener un papel importante, como ya sucedió en el caso del vuelo 447 de Air France, desaparecido durante su trayecto desde Río de Janeiro a París en junio de 2009.

¿Cómo ayudaron las matemáticas en aquel misterio? Y, ¿cómo podrían contribuir a resolver este?

Segmentos del Airbus 330 de Air France fueron hallados flotando en el Atlántico cinco días después, pero no podía resolverse el misterio del accidente sin hallar la caja negra y las grabaciones en la cabina.

Fuente de la imagen, AFP GETTY Pie de foto, El vuelo de Air France del 1 de julio de 2009 costó la vida a 228 personas.

Podría pensarse que tras localizar algunas partes de la aeronave sería fácil hallar el resto del avión, pero los objetos pueden desplazarse grandes distancias con las corrientes marinas.

El servicio de guardacostas de Estados Unidos utiliza frecuentemente diferentes tipos de software para simular el movimiento de posibles restos luego del impacto inicial.

Pero estos programas no servían en el caso del vuelo de Air France debido a las corrientes impredecibles que caracterizan la franja ecuatorial, especialmente en la época del año en la que ocurrió el accidente.

Buques y submarinos de Estados Unidos, Brasil y Francia buscaron el avión sin resultados.

La autoridad de investigación de accidentes de Francia, BEA por sus siglas en francés, decidió entonces pedir ayuda a un grupo de expertos en estadística de Estados Unidos con una reconocida trayectoria en la localización de objetos perdidos en el mar.

Fue así como Colleen Keller voló a Francia para contribuir en la búsqueda.

""BEA ya tenía varias teorías sobre los posibles sitios de impacto"", dijo la analista.

Para transformar toda esa información en números y probabilidades, Keller y su equipo de la empresa Metron Inc en Viriginia se basaron en el llamado Teorema de Bayes, desarrollado por un estadístico y clérigo presbiteriano británico llamado Thomas Bayes, quien falleció en 1761.

Todos los escenarios

Pie de foto, La técnica diseñada por Bayes es utilizada en muchos campos, desde las finanzas hasta la predicción del tiempo.

La técnica creada por Bayes permite evaluar al mismo tiempo varios escenarios, incluso contradictorios, para hallar la opción de mayor probabilidad.

Keller y sus colegas evaluaron el grado de incertidumbre de cada dato disponible para determinar el sitio más probable de localización del avión.

Los expertos dividieron el área de búsqueda en cuadrículas y usaron cifras para calcular en cada sección la probabilidad de que allí se encontrara la aeronave.

Para obtener esas cifras, Keller y su equipo analizaron las diferentes teorías sobre la causa del siniestro. Por ejemplo, evaluaron diferentes fallas mecánicas y llegaron a diferentes grados de probabilidad para cada escenario.

Los investigadores estadounidenses estudiaron luego datos históricos de accidentes previos y determinaron, por ejemplo, que los aviones fueron hallados frecuentemente muy cerca de su última posición conocida.

Por ultimo, Keller redujo la probabilidad para aquellos sitios donde ya se habían realizado búsquedas infructuosas.

""Hay dos componentes de la matemáticas de Bayes que la hacen única"", explicó Keller.

""Por un lado permite considerer toda la información incluyendo distintos grados de incertidumbre y combinar los datos, incluso posibilidades que se excluyen"".

""En el caso del vuelo MH370 de Malaysia Airlines se manejaba una posible trayectoria o arco hacia el norte y otra hacia el sur de la última ubicación conocida. El avión no pudo haber tomado ambos rumbos, fue hacia un lado o hacia el otro, pero el teorema de Bayes permite incluir y sopesar todas las teorías"".

La segunda ventaja es que la técnica desarrollada por Bayes es muy flexible, señaló Keller. Si hay nuevos datos, éstos se incorporan y el mapa de probabilidades se actualiza.

Hipótesis errada

Fuente de la imagen, Reuters Pie de foto, La agencia de investigaciones de accidentes de Francia anunció el hallazgo de la caja negra en 2011.

En el caso del vuelo de Air France, había certeza de que el avion había caído en un radio de 40 millas de la última localización transmitida por el sistema de seguridad de la aeronave.

Pero el área de búsqueda era tan enorme que los investigadores no sabían por donde comenzar.

El mapa de probabilidades diseñado por Keller permitió centrar el rastreo en una zona más limitada, pero aún así no fue posible localizar los restos del avión.

Por un momento pareció que la estadística no podia ayudar.

Pero varios meses después, Air France volvió a contactar a Keller para solicitarle un último intento de análisis de datos.

En esta ocasión, la analista y sus colegas cuestionaron una hipótesis asumida en un comienzo.

Datos históricos de otros accidentes indicaban que luego de la caída de un avión, la caja negra seguirá emitiendo una señal en el 90% de los casos.

Inmediatamente después de la desaparición del vuelo de Air France los equipos de búsqueda pasaron días barriendo con radares las áreas próximas a la última ubicacion conocida, intentando detectar señales o ""pings"" de los grabadores de voz o de la caja negra.

Puesto que no registraron ninguna señal, Keller y sus colegas habían concluido que la probabilidad de hallar el avión en esos sitios era muy baja.

¿Pero que sucedería si ni la caja negra ni los grabadores estaban enviando señales?

Los expertos de Metron adaptaron su modelo para incluir esa posibilidad y determinaron nuevas áreas de alta probabilidad. Un equipo de búsqueda retomó el rastreo con estas coordenadas y esta vez sí localizaron la aeronave.

""Áreas inmensas""

El misterio fue resuelto. La caja negra y el grabador de voz mostraron que una combinación de errores humanos y fallos técnicos fue lo que causó la caída del avión de Air France que se hundió en el Océano Atlántico en 2009.

El accidente del vuelo de Air France Río de Janeiro-París del 1 de julio de 2009 les costó la vida a las 228 personas que viajaban a bordo.

El informe final señaló que el piloto automático del Airbus dejó de funcionar por dos horas durante el turbulento vuelo nocturno y luego hubo fallas con el altímetro del avión y los sensores de velocidad de aire.

Los investigadores también dijeron que el capitán no cumplió con sus responsabilidades de gestión al no retomar el control de los copilotos después de un descanso.

""Fue un milagro encontrar los restos del avión,"" dijo Keller.

""Estaban en el fondo del mar, en una zona muy arenosa. Pero hay áreas en el fondo marino que parecen el Himalaya, con verdaderas montañas y valles"".

""Si el avión hubiera estado en una de esas zonas, tal vez jamás habría sido detectado"".

Keller no tiene certeza de que los restos del avión de Malaysia Airlines sean hallados algún día.

Aún si se encuentran partes de la aeronave, ello no quiere decir que pueda localizarse el resto.

""Han pasado tantos días desde que el avión desapareció que no creo que hallar algún objeto pueda ayudarnos demasiado"", dijo Keller.

""Estamos hablando de áreas inmensas. Sé que muchos pueden pensar, ¿cómo es posible no encontrar un Boeing 777?

""Pero si se encuentra en el fondo del Océano Índico, tristemente tal vez no sea hallado jamás"".",,2023-10-19 18:43:15.445939+00:00,True,False,,,,Cómo pueden las matemáticas ayudar a hallar los restos del MH370 - BBC.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adoption service under fire as it's revealed Davion Only - the boy who begged churchgoers to adopt him - is STILL not in a permanent home despite dozens of families being turned away

Davion Only, 16, - who captured the heart of the nation last year has still not been adopted

It was thought that he was being placed with a prospective family before Christmas - but he is no longer with them

Adoption agency Eckerd has been accused of ignoring many offers from couples to adopt Davion

The Florida teenager, has bounced around foster care his whole life

Despite a huge media blitz last year - the teen is now allegedly not allowed to speak to the media

Has no cellphone, email account or public Facebook profile



Six months after Florida teenager Davion Only asked a church full of strangers to help him find a real home - he still has not been adopted.



Criticism of Eckerd, the adoption agency charged with finding the now 16-year-old boy an adoptive family has grown - with many potential parents claiming that their phone calls have never been returned.



It is even alleged that the teenager who toured morning and national talk shows in September is no longer allowed to speak to the media, has no cellphone or email and has put his Facebook settings on private.

Indeed, the young-man - who captured the heart of the nation with his heart-breaking request last year - has grown despondent with those who know him saying that he 'just wants the whole process to be over'.

Still without a family: Davion Only, 16, who has spent his whole life in foster care and begged for anyone to adopt him at his church

The teenager made his stark, simple and emotional plea stood at the pulpit in September at the age of 15 wearing a donated suit and clutching a Bible he had borrowed from his boy's home.



'My name is Davion,' he said. 'And I’ve been in foster care since I was born.



He told the congregation: 'I'll take anyone. Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be really appreciative. The best I could be… I know God hasn't given up on me. So I'm not giving up either.'

Davion told the church he never knew his real family and that he hoped for a home.



He was featured on Good Morning America, Al Jazeera America and in People. Producers flew him in to speak with Barbara Walters in New York on The View. About 10,000 people around the globe called to ask about helping or adopting him.



Davion has since moved out of a group home and into a foster one as reported by the MailOnline in December, but sadly, he still does not have a permanent home or adoptive parents.

Now 16 - but still without a mother and father - Davion Only has not been found a permanent home and his former case worker Connie Going (right) said the teen is becoming despondent



Emotional plea: The orphan speaks before St Mark's Missionary Baptist Church to ask if someone would become his parent

Unstable childhood: Davion has been in the foster system his entire life, going from one temporary home to the next

'Something doesn’t seem right. I pray about it,' said his mentor, Richard Prince, 22.



'He’s changed schools and foster homes, and he’s not allowed to tell me certain things. People want to hear a happy ending, but it’s not too clear what’s going on.'



More than 300 people contacted the Times last fall saying they couldn’t get in touch with anyone at Davion’s foster agency, Eckerd.



The Tampa Bay Times contacted a sample of 40 of those potential parents. Of the 10 who responded, nine said they had not heard from Eckerd.



'We never received a response. This just breaks my heart,' wrote Marcy Theobald of Georgia to the Tampa Bay Times.



'What is wrong with the system?! Everyone deserves to be treated fairly and loved.'



'No one has contacted me regarding Davion,' Shelly Bergman wrote from Ohio.



'I just don't understand it, and I sure hope he does not lose his faith because of that. This sweet young man just wants to be loved by someone. Bring him here, I will welcome him with open arms.'





Inspiring: Davion Only at 15 with his case worker Connie Going in September before nervously making his speech before the congregation

Simple wish: Davion Only, the orphan whose plight gripped the nation, attended many interviews across the country about his plight

The paper were also contacted by Sharron Furno and her husband in Michigan. They run a license foster home and have four other adopted children.



Out of the 40 people the Tampa Bay Times contacted, she was the only one who had received any response from Ekcerd.



'I received an email stating that they were only considering families in the state,' Furno wrote.



'We offered to pay for his transportation. I offered to go to Florida and spend time with him. Why leave him there when they haven't been able to give him permanency in years?'



An Eckerd spokeswoman said Davion was meeting with prospective adoptive families and that the process would take time.



Some adoptions experts say they are not surprised that an adoption has taken so long, but other children’s advocates are appalled.



'The poor kid has got to be wondering, ‘Why, out of all those people, does no one want me?’ Dr. Gregory Keck, a psychologist who has spent 25 years working with foster and adopted children said.

Davion started to look for his mother, whom he had never met, using his birth certificate at a local library in June. He found her obituary and discovered that La-Dwina Ilene 'Big Dust' McCloud (left) had died aged 55 in Clearwater just weeks before

Biological family: Carolyn Ware, grandmother of Davion Only, spent time with her grandson over Thanksgiving Wanted him back: Davion's aunt Doris Barnes, pictured left in October, said Davion belongs with his biological family. She said she would take him in - but is not allowed because she has a criminal record

According to Florida's Department of Children and Families, adoption of a child from foster care should take between nine months and a year.



'I know Eckerd is committed to finding Davion the forever family that is perfect for him,' said interim Secretary Esther Jacobo.



'The relationship cannot be forced or rushed.'



In December it seemed that the teen was on the brink of a breakthrough.



He was introduced to a prospective adoptive family. Eckerd spokesperson Terri Durdaller said, 'He has moved from his group home placement at Carlton Manor to a foster home where he is enjoying getting to know the family. Davion is excited to be spending the holidays with a perspective adoptive family.'



However, still the teenage boy has not been found a permanent home. Durdaller said some media had misunderstood.



'The foster and adoptive parents are two separate systems,' said Durdaller.

Adorable: Davion, pictured at the age of seven, has been in foster care in Florida for his whole life

'He is in a foster home, things are more stable there. Sometimes a foster parent will adopt. But he is meeting with different perspective adoptive families. We have 15 years of his life to catch a family up on. That takes time.'



Indeed, some adoption experts said that they aren't surprised that Davion still hasn't been adopted.



'It isn't easy,' said Bob Rooks, who directs Explore Adoption, Florida's adoption referral center in Jacksonville to the Tampa Bay Times.



'Of all those 10,000 calls, probably only a small percentage already were qualified to adopt. And at his age, he has his own opinions. Maybe his needs were different from what those families wanted.'



Connie Going, the Eckerd adoptions specialist who took Davion to church back in September has called him 'a forgotten child.'



'I have to believe everything is going to be okay in the long run,' said Going. 'I think he just wants it all to be over.'

Looking for a family: 15-year-old Davion spoke to the church congregation about how badly he wanted a family to care about him

Indeed, Going now alleges that Davion is not allowed to speak to the media anymore - despite the huge publicity tour that Eckerd allowed him to go on in September.



For their part, Eckerd said that Davion has so far met with four prospective families and that they are hopeful the right fit has been found.



'It was decided that one family has the skills needed to care for him,' she wrote in an email to the Tampa Bay Times.



'All qualified families that did express an interest in adopting Davion were explored,' Durdaller wrote in February.

26207,https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/apr/10/eight-reasons-taxes-april-internal-revenue-service,2014-04-10 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2014-04-10 00:00:00. No one in America likes doing their taxes – except our colleague Emma Brockes, who calls it ""time travel for the soul"". For the rest of us earthbound mortals, the rule is procrastination. And you know what? That's perfectly natural and in, some cases, even justified.

Here's why you're absolutely right to dread your taxes.

1. You have no idea whether you owe money

The problem with taxes is that it's impossible to get an estimate. You fill out your documents, send them off and hope you don't get whopped with a giant bill. This tends to cause people to put off the pain.

""A lot of people determine when to file based on whether or not they are getting money back or whether or not they have to pay it out,"" says Lindsey Buchholz, principal research analyst at H&R Block.

The general rule of thought is that if you are getting money back, people usually file earlier so that they can get the money faster. And if they owe, they kind of try to push it off as long as possible.""

The majority of people do expect to get money back from the IRS: about 73% of refund returns are received before 1 April. To help these early filers track the progress of their refund, IRS has launched ""Where is my refund?"" site. In the first three months of 2013, the web site has logged 8.7m requests, says the IRS.

The money owed to the government, however, begins to roll in later than that. According to the IRS, the agency receives about 61% of the balance-due returns after 15 April, the filing deadline. That's a bad idea, by the way – if you hated the idea of paying your tax bill, it's going to be even worse with penalties.

2. You don't have any money lying around to pay the IRS

For some Americans, tax avoidance boils to something much more simpler: fear.

While some people are just overwhelmed by the process, some are genuinely afraid of not being able to pay their tax bill. Take Mr V, interviewed by the New York Times, who hasn’t filed his taxes in more than 30 years now.

I have theories, but none have helped me get past the fear of filing and doing it on time. I rationalize. I think I’m just a small guy and the IRS wouldn’t be interested in me. I do intend to file.”

For those Americans, who are afraid of not being able to pay, not filing is a pretty bad way to handle it. The amount they owe is only going to increase.

3. The IRS wants you to go into debt to pay your taxes

If you do owe money to the IRS, and you can't immediately afford it, you're likely to go into debt.

The IRS's own advice to those who owe it money include some unsavory options: instalment agreement, paying it off with a credit card, or even taking out a loan from a bank. In fact, the agency prefers that you go into debt rather than make instalment payments. Their advice is as follows:

“If you are unable to pay the amount due, it is often in your best interest to get a loan to pay the bill in full rather than to make instalment payments to the IRS.""



“You can pay your bill with a credit card. The interest rate on a credit card may be lower than the combination of interest and penalties imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.”

It turns out that the IRS charges the kind of interest that would make a bank blush.

“The penalty for filing late is normally 5% of the unpaid taxes for each month or part of a month that a tax return is late,"" according to the IRS. ""That penalty starts accruing the day after the tax filing due date.""

Here's how the math works: not paying your taxes comes to 6% per year, according to Gail Rosen, a CPA in New Jersey. That comes from a 3% failure-to-pay penalty, calculated at .25% times 12 months, plus 3% interest, Rosen calculates.

""My opinion is that it depends on where elsewhere you can go for a loan,"" she says. ""A credit card can be more expensive."" The trouble with the instalment payments is that not everyone qualifies: you have to be current with all your tax returns and payments, according to Buchholz.

There is yet another option: short-term extension. The short-term 120 day extension can be requested from the IRS, with no application fee – but the IRS would keep counting the failure-to-pay penalty and interest against you during the extension.

4. You're disorganized

We've all been there. You know you have that 1099, you just don't know where.

One of the main reasons that people tend to put off filing their taxes till the last minute can be attributed to the amount of paperwork that they have to compile. There are the W-2s, the 1099s, possible receipts for deduction, maybe a letter about your college loans or tuition.

""If you have a lot of documents that you have to get together, you may end up waiting longer because it takes you longer to get organized,"" says Buchholz.

The best way to avoid this is to designate some part of your house or apartment a dumping ground for all things IRS-related. Some people use a shoebox; others use a drawer. Others have perfectly matched file folders. Either way, resolve from now to keep things together.

And remember: if it's a lost cause, you can always request your tax documents from the IRS itself, including your W-2 information for the past 10 years. You can also ask your employer, or former employer, to run off another copy for you.

5. Genetics won't let you finish your taxes

Rather than blaming stray W-2s or 1099s, some Americans can now blame their genetics. A recent study revealed that procrastination was hereditary in about half of the study’s subjects. For the other half, it comes back to nature versus nurture, as the study also found that those leading busy stressful lives tend to procrastinate as well. In some cases, procrastination was a result of influences of friends.

""I’m too busy, I’ll get to it later"" will only get you so far. For most, that means scrambling to file come April. About 20% of Americans wait until the week before the deadline to file their taxes, says the IRS. In 2012, the number of the Americans filing at the last minute was 27.1 million.

6. It really is complicated

The current 1040 form – the main tax form filed by most Americans – has 77 line items as well as a 189-page appendix of instructions, reports Quartz.

In just the last 20 years, the length of the form has increased 21%, up from 65 lines in 1991.""

Urgh.

7. It takes too much time and costs money, too

“The IRS says it takes an average of four hours just to complete and submit a Form 1040. Add at least another hour if you also have to complete a state return,"" says John Ams, executive vice-president at the National Society of Accountants.

You have to ask, ‘How much is your time worth?’ Plus I haven’t met many people who enjoy preparing their taxes, so hiring a professional to prepare your tax return can take a very unpleasant task off your plate. That’s worth something.

Ams adds that if the accountant catches just one deduction or credit that you might have missed, that might cover his fee. To get a professional to file their 2013 1040 and a state tax return, Americans are looking at a bill of about $261.

8. You don't think taxes are fair

Join the club. You don't need to be an Idaho anti-society survivalist to resent the big hit from taxes.

Last year, 55% as Americans described their tax rate as fair. That's lowest since 2001, according to Gallup. It appears that this sentiment is shared by rich and poor alike.

Perceptions of income tax fairness, perhaps surprisingly, vary little by household income level. Fifty-seven percent of those whose annual household income level is below $75,000 say their taxes are fair, as do 54% of those whose income is $75,000 or above.

The biggest difference, of course, was based on political affiliation. While just 32% of Democrats described their taxes as not fair, for Republicans that number was 48%.

What we want to know is who – besides Warren Buffett – made up the 2% of Americans that described their taxes as too low. Seriously.

One good thing to remember, however, when things get dark, is that our taxes pay for things like national parks. Picture yourself writing that tax check to Old Faithful.",,2023-10-19 20:20:19.069128+00:00,True,False,,,,Eight reasons you're right to dread your taxes this April - The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lance Underwood, a Delaware father-of-two, has produced a series of photographs for his blog, QT Albums, in which he recreates famous album covers using his young sons as models.

Dressed in similar outfits and adopting identical poses, sons Amar, four, and Taj, seven, do an excellent job of imitating music legends such as Bob Dylan, Nat King Cole, Bill Cosby and Johnny Cash.

'I took all the photos with my cell phone,' Mr Underwood, who is an eye doctor and counts photography as a side hobby, tells MailOnline.

Striking resemblance: Lance Underwood, a Delaware father-of-two, created a whole series of album cover recreations starring his sons Amar, four, and Taj, seven (pictured)

'Sometimes getting Amar, who was three for most of the pictures, to co-operate was a challenge, but he always nails the pose,' he says fondly.

The talented father, also a musician, says the idea first struck him as he was admiring the album cover of Marvin Gaye's What's Going On, and 'the simple beauty' of its design.

'Then I thought, my son would look cool impersonating that cover,' he explains, adding that this sparked the whole series of subsequent imitations.

Cool kid: Mr Underwood, who is an eye doctor and counts photography and a side hobby, says he took all the snaps with his cell phone, including this Bob Dylan recreation, starring son Amar, four



Johnny Cash: The talented father says the photos themselves don't take too long, it's 'gathering up all the clothes' that is the most time-consuming aspect

Little joker: Amar (pictured far right) says his favorite part of the process is doing the 'silly poses,' and was only three years old when most of the photos were taken

The cover that started it all: Mr Underwood says it was in admiring this album art that he was first struck with the idea to draft in his sons and copy it

Mr Underwood says the photos themselves don't actually take too long to get right.' The longest part is gathering up the clothes for each of the albums,' he tells us.

And sure enough, everything from the rapper gear donned in the Outkast and Fresh Prince covers, to the sharp suits worn in the Joe Henderson and Andrew Hill examples, and the classic hounds-tooth fedora sported in the Nat King Cole cover - all match the original shots almost exactly.



'Taj says his favorite part is dressing up as the musicians,' Mr Underwood informs us, adding that Amar most enjoys doing the 'silly' poses.

He says he uses Gimp, free software similar to Photoshop, to edit and transform the photos into the album art; a process that takes him between about 30 minutes to a couple of hours.

And where a third model is required, Mr Underwood even makes a few cameo appearances himself. He can be seen crooning along with his sons in the Last Poets album cover, and striking a pose clad in sunglasses and a hoody in the Black Moon cover.

Not content with simply borrowing from his music idols, Mr Underwood has even recorded his own album, Beats by Q and Trey.

Otherworldly: The exceptionally cool father even makes a few cameo appearances in some of the examples, including this imitation of The Last Poets' cover (far left)

Musical fan: As if the covers themselves weren't enough, Mr Underwood (far right) has since recorded an 11-track album, entitled Beats by Q and Trey, inspired by and featuring his two sons

The 11 songs, which he says were inspired by his two treasured sons, is comprised of 'progressive hip hop' elements and carry mellifluous jazz undertones.

'These songs came about from playing around with my sons on my keyboard singing, dancing and being silly,' he says of the album.

Dropbox says it is committed to security and privacy, despite admitting that its services were vulnerable to the Heartbleed internet encryption flaw.

But while the company has assured users that a password change will protect their data, Dropbox vice president Ross Piper was today unable to give assurances that security had not been breached in the past.

Piper confirmed that the company was using the version of OpenSSL encryption affected by Heartbleed, but that all of its servers had been patched to address the problem.

Locating local internet providers

""We notified all of our users that this had occurred and updated that we had patched our services through our blog, and have suggested that users change their passwords,"" he said. ""We also have Perfect Forward technology – so any of the vulnerabilities that were open don't go into past access. Any past access that a key might have had, it doesn't allow it to be re-used...and that's been one of the technologies that has protected a lot of users.

""But we did patch all of our services, we rotated all of our keys, all of our encryptions, every user-facing aspect of the service.""

Locating local internet providers

Dropbox users are advised to change their passwords, though company has not issued an email notification to its customers. Instead, Piper said Dropbox has ""chosen to communicate through the [Dropbox] blog"".

Although Dropbox patched its servers to address the problem when it was discovered last week, it has emerged that the Heartbleed flaw has been leaving OpenSSL-encrypted websites vulnerable for two years, raising questions about potential data breaches that may have gone unnoticed in the past.

When asked whether users could be sure their data was not breached in the past, Piper said, ""We can only look forward and keep trying to protect them as best we can"".

""With security and privacy there is no finish line, and you can only keep striving to become better and better,"" he said. ""The moment we delved into this, we operated to close the vulnerability as fast as possible.""

It's not just Heartbleed that has some Dropbox users concerned about privacy – the company announced last week that it would be appointing former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to its board, spurring protest in some corners of the internet and calls for users to ""Drop Dropbox"".

A website dedicated to the Drop Dropbox movement admonishes the decision, saying ""Rice not only spoke in favor of the Bush administration's warrantless wiretap program and expansive domestic surveillance program, she authorized the warrantless wiretap of UN Security Council members.

""Given everything we now know about the US's warrantless surveillance program, and Rice's role in it, why on earth would we want someone like her involved with Dropbox, an organization we are trusting with our most important business and personal data?

""When a company quite literally has access to all of your data, ethics become more than a fun thought experiment.""

Speaking today, Dropbox's vice president said the company stood by its decision and believed Dr Rice was a good fit for the company's board.

""It doesn't change our privacy principles in any way,"" said Piper. ""Our reasons for bringing Dr Rice on the board really centre around her incredible experience managing very large scale organisations...as well as dealing with very highly-talented individuals, which suits our engineering culture very well.

""We think we've built a pretty good and trusting relationship with our users, and we want to maintain that through everything. We've made the decision about Dr Rice based on the reasons that I've described, and we think it's still our responsibility to earn that trust every day and we will continue to do everything to create clearer transparency and conform to the privacy requirements of our users.""",,2023-10-19 20:34:28.977649+00:00,True,True,False,,,"Dropbox stands firm on privacy, despite Heartbleed risk and board appointments - CNET",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Google is warning users of its search engine that if they visit filesharing website Demonoid, they could find malicious software being downloaded and installed on their computers.

Anyone searching for the site, which relaunched earlier this year after a lengthy period offline, sees a message warning that ""This site may harm your computer"".

If they decide to click through, they are taken to a Google ""Malware Warning"" page rather than the website, suggesting that they return to Google and pick another search result, or continue at their own risk. The page also points to a diagnostic report explaining why Demonoid has been blocked.

""Of the 78 pages we tested on the site over the past 90 days, 7 page(s) resulted in malicious software being downloaded and installed without user consent,"" explains that page, citing malicious software hosted on the adv-inc-net.com domain, as well as ""intermediaries for distributing malware"" tlvmedia.com and torrpedo.net.

The block goes beyond Google's search engine, too. Users of its Chrome web browser are also being warned off Demonoid. ""The website ahead contains malware!"" explained a warning page encountered by The Guardian today when trying to visit the site using Chrome.

""Google Chrome has blocked access to demonoid.ph for now. Even if you have visited this website safely in the past, visiting it now is very likely to infect your Mac with malware.""

Demonoid is still accessible through Apple's Safari browser, but is blocked by Mozilla's Firefox, which shows its own ""Reported Attack Page! This web page at demonoid.ph has been reported as an attack page and has been blocked based on your security preferences"" warning page when users try to access the site.

According to technology news site TorrentFreak, Demonoid is blaming advertisers on its site for the detected malware. ""We run content from a lot of ad networks in our ad banners, and a lot of banners from each,"" it explained in a statement.

""One of those banners started serving malware, so we disabled all ads until we are 100% sure of the culprit and get it removed. We are also taking the proper steps to get us out of all the blacklists.""





Piracy: UK ISPs close to deal with entertainment industry

Forget suing filesharers: in 2014, follow the money

Study: illegal downloaders more likely to pay for films





Anti-piracy campaigners will be rubbing their hands with joy at the news, though. A recent report by British film, TV and video body The Industry Trust claimed that 90% of the top piracy sites in the UK contain malware or credit card scams.

The City of London Police's PIPCU intellectual property crime unit, which is funded by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, backed the study, which also claimed that 77% of people who had visited a pirate website had found ""unwanted extras"" including malware, spyware and intrusive pop-up ads.

""People need to know that by visiting copyright infringing websites they are running the risk of having their personal details stolen and used fraudulently, as well as exposing their computer to malicious malware and viruses,"" said PIPCU head DCI Andy Fyfe at the time.

News of Google's Demonoid block also comes at a time when PIPCU – in partnership with various creative industries – is trying to squeeze the flow of advertising revenue to filesharing sites from respectable brands. In April, PIPCU launched an Infringing Website List of sites it believes brands and agencies should ensure aren't carrying their ads.

If this strategy is successful, then it may in turn force filesharing sites to look elsewhere for their banner ads: gambling and porn, for example. If this also brings more risk of malware-toting ads like those found on Demonoid, rightsholders will be sure to point this out regularly as an incentive for people not to frequent these sites.

Google's decision to block Demonoid could bring more pressure on the internet giant from those rightsholders, though. Music bodies like the BPI and IFPI have long lobbied Google to remove sites from its search index if they are consistently linked to piracy.

Until now, their strategy has focused on sending a barrage of takedown notices for infringing links on Google. The Demonoid news may encourage them to also conduct more research into malware on filesharing sites, and present those results to Google in an effort to get them blocked.",,2023-10-19 22:21:32.768116+00:00,True,True,False,,,Google blocks filesharing website Demonoid over malware downloads - The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26710,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airtraffic-bug-exclusive-idUSBREA4B02320140512,2014-05-11 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.reuters.com,,"Published on 2014-05-12 05:10:36+00:00. NEW YORK (Reuters) - A common design problem in the U.S. air traffic control system made it possible for a U-2 spy plane to spark a computer glitch that recently grounded or delayed hundreds of Los Angeles area flights, according to an inside account and security experts.

The air traffic control tower is seen through a window as construction workers work on the Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), in Los Angeles, California April 24, 2013. REUTERS/Patrick T. Fallon

In theory, the same vulnerability could have been used by an attacker in a deliberate shut-down, the experts said, though two people familiar with the incident said it would be difficult to replicate the exact conditions.

The error blanked out a broad swath of the southwestern United States, from the West Coast to western Arizona and from southern Nevada to the Mexico border.

As aircraft flew through the region, the $2.4 billion system made by Lockheed Martin Corp, cycled off and on trying to fix the error, triggered by a lack of altitude information in the U-2’s flight plan, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the incident.

No accidents or injuries were reported from the April 30 failure, though numerous flights were delayed or canceled.

Lockheed Martin said it conducts “robust testing” on all its systems and referred further questions about the En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) system to the Federal Aviation Administration.

FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said the computer had to examine a large number of air routes to “de-conflict the aircraft with lower-altitude flights”.

She said that process “used a large amount of available memory and interrupted the computer’s other flight-processing functions”.

The FAA later set the system to require altitudes for every flight plan and added memory to the system, which should prevent such problems in the future, Brown said.

COMPLEX FLIGHT PLAN

When the system went out, air traffic controllers working in the regional center switched to a back-up system so they could see the planes on their screens, according to one of the sources.

Paper slips and telephones were used to relay information about planes to other control centers.

The ERAM system failed because it limits how much data each plane can send it, according to the sources. Most planes have simple flight plans, so they do not exceed that limit.

But a U-2 operating at high altitude that day had a complex flight plan that put it close to the system’s limit, the sources said.

The plan showed the plane going in and out of the Los Angeles control area multiple times, not a simple point-to-point route like most flights, they said.

The flight plan did not contain an altitude for the flight, one of the sources said. While a controller entered the usual altitude for a U-2 plane - about 60,000 feet - the system began to consider all altitudes between ground level and infinity.

The conflict generated error messages and caused the system to begin cycling through restarts.

“The system is only designed to take so much data per airplane,” one of the sources said. “It keeps failing itself because it’s exceeded the limit of what it can do.”

CYBER ATTACK CONCERN

The sources said the circumstances would be difficult for an attacker to mimic, since they involved a complex flight plan, an altitude discrepancy and an input from the controller that added to the flight plan data.

Former military and commercial pilots said flight plans are generally carefully checked and manually entered into the air traffic control computers, which are owned by the FAA.

“It would be hard to replicate by a hostile government, but it shows a very basic limitation of the system,” said a former military and commercial pilot.

Cyber-attacks on aviation have been an area of increased concern for intelligence officials, who said earlier this year they will set up a new center in Maryland for sharing information on detected and possible threats.

Security experts said that from the description by insiders, the failure appeared to have been made possible by the sort of routine programming mistake that should have been identified in testing before it was deployed.

“That’s when you put in values anywhere that a human could put in a number, like minus one feet, or a million feet, to see what that would do,” said Jeff Moss, founder of the Black Hat and Def Con security conferences and an advisor to the Department of Homeland Security.

While it might be logical to limit the amount of data associated with one flight plan, anything exceeding that amount should not be able to render the system useless, they said.

Though they welcomed the FAA’s assurance that a fix was being rolled out, they said the incident suggested that similar failures could be found.

“If it’s now understood that there are flight plans that cause the automated system to fail, then the flight plan is an ‘attack surface,’” said Dan Kaminsky, co-founder of the White Ops security firm and an expert in attacks based on over-filling areas of computer memory.

“It’s certainly possible that there are other forms of flight plans that could cause similar or even worse effects,” Kaminsky said. “This is part of the downside of automation.”

Moss said many hackers have been studying aspects of a new $40 billion air traffic control system, known as NextGen, which encompasses ERAM, including its reliance on Global Positioning System data that could be faked.

At least two talks at this summer’s Def Con will look at potential weaknesses in the system.

“It’s very over-budget and behind schedule, so it doesn’t surprise me that it’s got some bugs - it’s the way it presented itself” that’s alarming, Moss said.

But air traffic controllers and pilots said ERAM is a vast improvement over past systems and that it is needed to fit growing plane traffic into the airspace safely.

Nate Pair, president of the Los Angeles Center for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said it was remarkable that ERAM was restored less than an hour after the outage, limiting the effect on travelers.

“We were completely shut down and 46 minutes later we were back up and running,” Pair said.

“That could have easily been several hours and then we would have been into flight delays for days because of the ripple effects.”",,2023-10-19 22:25:32.406996+00:00,True,True,True,,0.810919097504283,Exclusive: Air traffic system failure caused by computer memory shortage - Reuters,U-2 Spy Plane Triggers Computer Glitch Grounding LA Flights,"The software failure incident occurred on April 30, 2014, in the U.S. air traffic control system.

26808,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/28/spotify-hack-android-app,2014-05-28 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2014-05-28 00:00:00. Android users will now have to download a new Spotify app if they wish to continue using the service, as the company reacts to a break-in that led to one user’s data compromised.

Spotify reported on Tuesday that the company’s internal systems had been hacked. An investigation into the attack revealed that only one user’s data had been accessed, but that this did not include password or finical information.

“As a precautionary measure against any potential ongoing risk, we are going to guide Android app users to upgrade over the next few days. If Spotify prompts you for an upgrade, please follow the instructions,” said Oskar Stål, Spotify’s chief technology officer in a blog post.

The mandatory update applies to both free and subscription users.

Spotify is not requiring changes to another other app versions such as those for Windows, Mac, iPhone, iPad, or Windows Phone - which some have taken as an indication that the Android version was the target of the hack.



'Necessary precaution'

Spotify is now pushing out an update to the existing Spotify Android app, which disables the app forcing users to download a separate new app called “Spotify Music”.

Users then have to open the new app and re-download any music that was previously stored offline on the device. Users are not prompted to re-login to the new app, however.

Once the new app is installed and opened it will help users remove the old version of Spotify from their device, which is now listed as ""no longer supported"".

“This is a necessary precaution to safeguard the quality of our service and protect our users,” said Stål while asking for understanding. “We have taken steps to strengthen our security systems in general and help protect you and your data – and we will continue to do so. We will be taking further actions in the coming days to increase security for our users.”



Not quite as simple as it seems

“Had this been as simple as one user over-sharing their login credentials, it would not warrant an all-user notification,” said Dwayne Melancon, chief technology officer of security firm Tripwire. “Given that Spotify claims that only one user’s data has been compromised, I suspect this was achieved via a re-usable, broadly applicable attack method perhaps affecting older versions of the Spotify app.”

Both security experts and Spotify urge users to install the new Android app when prompted.

'Personal information is not their plaything'

The move comes just days after auction site eBay revealed that it had been attacked and that hackers had gained entry into its customer database, forcing it to issue password reset requests to its 145 million monthly active users.

Hackers stole encrypted passwords as well as customer names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers and dates of birth, which were not encrypted. Many security experts questioned the company’s handling of private user data and brought the storage of user data by companies under the spotlight.

“This sort of thing is going to go on and on and on until businesses wake up and realise that personal information is not their plaything; it’s our information and it needs to be protected,” said Christopher Graham the Information Commissioner, who is looking into the eBay hack.",,2023-10-19 22:27:58.919085+00:00,True,True,False,,,Spotify hack leads to rollout of new Android app - The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26855,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/12/sonys-project-morpheus-virtual-reality-console-gaming,2014-05-12 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2014-05-12 00:00:00. After 30 years in the geek wilderness, virtual reality entertainment is suddenly being taken extremely seriously.



In March, the independent manufacturer of a forthcoming VR gaming headset, the Oculus Rift, was bought by Facebook for $2bn. Later that month, Brendan Iribe, the Oculus CEO, claimed that the two companies would one day build an online multiplayer virtual reality game for one billion players. A few years ago, that would have been insanely hubristic. Now? Probably not.

Crucially, Oculus Rift isn’t the only one fighting for the future of virtual reality. Sony’s got its own add-on VR headset for the PlayStation 4 called Project Morpheus, and even though it is still in development, it is a convincing look at the future of gaming, virtual tourism and a whole new set of experiences.



Right now, Sony is actively researching what is possible, what works and what doesn’t in this new world of immersive entertainment. Lots of things are currently up in the air: such as how it will be used in the home, how it will fit into Sony’s greater consumer electronics lineup and when users will actually be able to get their hands on one. What is certain is that carbon-copying traditional 2D games and slapping them on a face-mounted 3D screen is not going to work.

Convincing virtual reality – a big leap ahead of what was available the last time VR raised its head in the 1980s – holds a lot of potential for new ways of interacting, playing and experiencing content; not just games.

“Games for the Morpheus are going to be very different,” said Jed Ashforth, a senior game designer with Sony, who has spent the past 18 months playing and experiencing everything virtual reality has to offer to discover what’s possible with the new headsets. “The sense of having a presence within the game is something totally new. It’s a very different experience.”

In the same way as the Nintendo Wii’s motion-oriented gaming opened up the industry to new users, from children to grandparents and casual gamers everywhere, VR could have a similar impact. Ashforth says: “I’ve tried it with my kids, my mum, everyone loves it. VR goes beyond the traditional shooting or running and jumping. You can use it to walk through a museum or experience something you could never normally do. If you want to take a quick tour of the surface of Mars, that’s possible, or perhaps a spin through the Louvre. VR can do that.”



Ashforth explained that Sony had been working on virtual reality for years, but only now were VR headsets becoming a viable option. Mobile phones have driven the development of small, high-resolution screens and brought their price down to affordable levels, a “perfect storm” combined with the advancement in sensors, motion controls, binaural 3D audio and the processing power to make it happen. He added: “Having the processors and equipment to power two high-resolution screens at 60 frames per second with very low latency [delay before the screen updates to the position of a user's head or view] is crucial, as lag is one of the biggest factors that makes a poor, nauseating VR experience, something we must avoid if we’re going to convince people to get onboard.”

Two screens strapped to your head

The Morpheus headset resembles most other head-mounted displays. Two screens are suspended in front of your eyes while a headband makes sure the whole thing doesn’t move. The current design allows users to add their own headphones, which strangely plug into the headset in a socket in the goggles, something Ashforth assured me wouldn’t be the case in the finished product. One cable connects the Morpheus headset to a processing unit that hooks up to the PlayStation 4.

The processing unit is needed to handle some of the computational duties the dual-screen headset demands, leaving as much of the processing power of the PS4 available for the game or experience.

It also means that in future Sony could upgrade the processing unit, providing enhanced functionality without having to change the PS4 or the headset itself. Sony has looked at trying to go wireless with a VR headset, but the power and processing requirements as well as wireless bandwidth have made it impossible at this stage. But, says Ashforth, “Never say never.”



Lights, camera, motion

The outside of the Morpheus headset is dotted with lights, which allow the PlayStation camera to track its position and orientation. PS Move controllers and the PS4's DualShock 4 joypad share the same lighting nodules for tracking their position, making the whole thing a one-camera system.

There are no two ways about it, the headset is heavy for something strapped to your head, but isn’t uncomfortable to wear. It is something you will notice as you move around, but the single cable is light enough not to cause a drag on your head as you do so.

Once inside the headset, the outside world is entirely obscured. The screens are crisp enough that you cannot see any pixelation, even at that minimal distance from your eyes, which combined with the fast refresh rate and 3D audio create a truly immersive experience. Other people in the room with you will be able to see what you see through the headset in 2D on a normal television, which allows social elements to be introduced to what appears on the surface a very solitary gaming experience.

The Deep

Ashforth explained how other players could interact with the virtual world and play other parts of the story concurrently. The Deep, one of the demos on offer at a recent PlayStation press event, enables the player to be (virtually) locked in a diving cage and sent into the ocean – less a game and more of an example of a tourist-style experience.

At one stage a shark attacks the cage, ripping parts off. Other players can introduce fish and other events into the depths via second screen apps on tablets and smartphones, while watching what happens on a regular television. The “in player” experience of the Deep is really convincing. You can spin around, see your shoulder, look down and see your flippers, and even see your knees bend as you crouch in real life.

The sensory deprivation, flowing underwater sounds and voices over the radio add to the experience, as well as the shock as a shark burst out and attacks your cage. A flare gun is in your hand, controlled by a DualShock 4 controller, which helps to anchor your vision. In fact, I expected my ears to pop and to feel the pressure as the cage sinks.

The Castle

One of the other demos cooked up by internal Sony game developers is The Castle. It showed how the Morpheus headset can be used with Sony’s PS Move controllers.

Here, two of the controllers become your hands in the game, allowing you to rotate your wrists and grip in a very natural way. The trigger buttons close your fists allowing you to punch a mannequin, much like boxing as part of Wii Sports on the Nintendo Wii, except this time with a more direct connection between your actions and what happens on screen.

The experience is convincing enough that it really feels as if the onscreen hands are your own, moving within your vision in precise co-ordination with your real hand movements.

The demo then progresses to swords, two of which are stuck in the ground forcing the player to reach over and grab them, pulling them out of the ground and into a fighting position. It all feels very natural and intuitive, holding the trigger button to grip the swords and then swinging them the way you would a real sword.

It is perhaps only when you make a connection with the mannequin and don’t feel any resistance as the sword passes through that you suddenly become aware that you aren’t really holding a sword – your brain expects physical resistance.

The final stage of the demo gives you a crossbow, which immediately had me shutting one eye to aim down the iron sights. Shutting one eye made no difference at all, of course, but such an instinctive reaction shows how immersive the experience is.

At the end of the Castle, a dragon appears, swooping down over the player's head. In my demo, it growled and then ate me, ending the game. The fact that you can hear and then see the dragon take off and then fly over head, turning your vision and looking over your shoulder, adds to the experience dramatically, but also illustrates that it is possible to miss some interactions entirely if you happen not to look in the right direction at the time.

Throughout the Castle demo you can walk forwards and backwards to adjust your striking distance for the swords or punches, which to me felt relatively natural, although I was aware that real-world objects like a table lay in my path and there was no way to know whether I was about to hit it. All perception of your real-world surroundings become removed as you place the headset on and are instantly transported to another world.

The final demo shown off was space combat game, Eve Valkyrie. Originally designed and programmed with the Oculus Rift in mind, and now taking advantage of the Morpheus headset, it was the only demo on offer that was not produced by Sony and was much more of complete game.



As a result, the experience is leagues above the other demos. Players are puts inside a star fighter, and the seated-only playing position utterly suits the experience of using the Morpheus.

Controlling the ship is pretty much like any 2D space flight game using the DualShock 4 joypad, but it is the fact that you can look all around your ship that makes the empty void of space feel so much more real.

With the system tracking your head movements, you can lean to the side and peer down the side of your pilot’s seat inside your cockpit. The team from CCP joked that they should stick a chocolate bar wrapper or two around the cabin to make the experience a bit more authentic.

You can lean out and peer over the edges of your cockpit, too, twist your head and view space and ships fly by through the windows, and look up as you pitch your ship, tracking the enemy in your vision. In fact, the experience of putting on the headset they way you would a helmet and being able to see every bit of the inside of the cockpit, including your hands, arms, legs and chest, makes it so immersive that on launch I felt as if my head was being thrown back as the ship rocketed out of the docking bay.

John Nejady, a quality assurance analyst with Eve Valkyrie's developer, CCP, says: “The low latency and high frame rate boost the 'in-person' experience. But we still need to think about unpredictable events. With the kind of player-focused vision that VR provides, you need to make sure events are anchored in the reality and physics of the game. Things that happen too quickly or come from out of nowhere look like bugs, even if they aren’t.”

Nejady, one of the 26-man team in Newcastle working on the VR-only title, adds: “The connection we have between the virtual and real world – sitting in the pilots seat and playing seated – helps prevent the discomfort that can occur with VR.”

In the game, I didn’t feel any motion sickness or nausea until I intentionally pulled a very heavy and fast barrel roll and looked straight into it. At that point, there was a little queasiness, but it would certainly have been the same in a real life in a fighter jet, for instance. It seems that in the coming world of virtual reality entertainment, the most important limits might not be those of the hardware, but those of the player.

PARIS (Reuters) - David Luiz became the world’s most expensive defender on Friday when he completed his move from Chelsea to Ligue 1 champions Paris St Germain.

“Paris St Germain is delighted to announce the transfer of Brazilian international David Luiz from Chelsea for the next five years,” read a statement on the club’s website (www.psg.fr).

No financial details were disclosed but media reports estimate the fee for the 27-year-old World Cup center back is worth between 40 ($67.16 million) and 50 million pounds.

That surpasses the 36 million pounds PSG paid AC Milan in 2012 for Luiz’s World Cup partner Thiago Silva.

PSG have now paid three of the four largest fees for defenders having also splashed out 27 million pounds last year on Brazilian Marquinhos from AS Roma.

Former England international Rio Ferdinand was the most expensive defender after moving from Leeds United to Manchester United for 29 million pounds in 2002 but that fee has since been surpassed by Silva and Luiz.

The mop-haired Brazilian arrived at Chelsea from Benfica in January 2011 and established himself as a fan favorite, making 143 appearances and scoring 12 goals.

Luiz was part of the team that won the Champions League and FA Cup in 2012 and the Europa League in 2013.

“Right from the very first contact I had with Paris St Germain I was very happy,” he said.

“It’s a big club with a great history ... it’s a new step in my life and I’m impatient to play for Paris and show what I can do,” added Luiz.

GREAT TIME

“I will be defending the colors of one of the biggest clubs in the world. It will be a great time for me, both professionally and personally. I want to enjoy myself and, if possible, win as much as possible.”

Luiz follows England pair Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole in leaving Stamford Bridge during the close season.

“David Luiz has today completed his transfer to Paris St Germain,” Chelsea said in a statement.

“The Brazilian leaves with the best wishes of everybody at Chelsea Football Club and we would like to thank him for his fantastic service.”

Luiz joins an expensively-assembled squad at the Parc des Princes that includes Sweden’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Uruguay’s Edinson Cavani and Brazilian team mate Lucas Moura.

Thiago Silva and Luiz were central defensive partners when the host nation kicked off the World Cup on Thursday with a 3-1 victory over Croatia.

PSG boast a squad that ranks among the best in Europe. The club reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League in each of the last two campaigns. They came within minutes of qualifying for the semi-finals this season before being knocked out by Luiz’s Chelsea but the defender has now set his sights on bringing European success to his new club. “I want to win the French League, all the cups and, most of all, the Champions League which is every player’s dream,” he said. “I want to win it a second time. Rest assured we will be doing everything we can to give the supporters the chance to celebrate a European triumph.”

Imagine driving down the highway at 70 miles per hour, when suddenly the wheel turns hard right. You crash. And it was because someone hacked your car.

It's not far-fetched science fiction. It's the near-term future today's hackers are warning about.

Most people aren't aware their cars are already high-tech computers. And now we're networking them by giving them wireless connectivity. Yet there's a danger to turning your car into a smartphone on wheels: It makes them a powerful target for hackers.

Interviews with automakers, suppliers and security advisers reveal a major problem with the new wave of ""connected"" cars: The inside of your car has ancient technology that presents a security risk.

The 50 to 100 tiny computers that control your steering, acceleration and brakes are really dumb. They rarely conduct authentication, checking whether that message is really coming from you. An outsider can send them commands.

The computer code in cars is outdated. It's similar to the on/off switches used in industrial controls. It's easily manipulated.

Much like the human central nervous system, every electronic part inside a car is connected to a central spine. Tap one part, you can likely reach any other.

""The protocol and internal parts of the car were never meant to be connected to anything,"" said Joe Klein, a researcher at security firm Disrupt6.

Cars' computers were built safely enough back in the 1990s, when the car was a closed box. But their architecture won't hold up as we hook them up to the Internet.

Consider the level of complexity of modern day cars -- and the chance for a screw up. The space ship that put humans on the moon, Apollo 11, had 145,000 lines of computer code. The Android operating system has 12 million. A modern car? Easily 100 million lines of code.

""Auto manufacturers are not up to speed,"" said Ed Adams, a researcher at Security Innovation, a company that tests the safety of automobiles. ""They're just behind the times. Car software is not built to the same standards as, say, a bank application. Or software coming out of Microsoft.""

The nightmare scenario: Hackers access your car's core controls by breaching its Internet-connected entertainment system and tamper with your brakes.

Hackers have already proven that scenario can happen. Security engineers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek demonstrated last year how they could hijack control of a car by connecting laptops to the dashboard.

But cars are going wireless. The next generation of Audi and Tesla (TSLA) automobiles are connected to the AT&T (T) network. Wires won't be needed to hack them.

Related: Cybersecurity: How safe are you?

Meanwhile, there's a growing potential for car malware. Makers of ""infotainment"" systems -- dashboards that function like a tablet -- are racing to add fun apps. But if automobiles' internal electronics remain insecure, downloading a malicious app to your car could spell big trouble. That's why auto suppliers are taking initiative.

Harman (HAR) makes Bluetooth audio devices that end up in BMWs, Hyundais, Mercedes-Benzes and others. The company is adding its own layers of security by using software to virtually separate the entertainment system from the car's network. It raises the bar of difficulty for a hacker to use a music app to worm his way into your steering controls.

Sachin Lawande leads Harman's infotainment division and justifies its initiative: ""The assumption we're making is that it'll take a while for the auto industry to move to a more secure internal network than what we have today.""

Continental, one of the world's three major auto parts suppliers, is partnering with IBM (IBM) and Cisco (CSCO) to make firewalls that control the information flow between the car's devices. Until it gets security all figured out, the German company is holding back from adding full Internet connectivity features, such as real-time information from the engine that alerts the local car shop ahead of time.

""Without having a good firewall or security in place, I can't go to the auto manufacturer and say, 'Let me have access to information from engine management,'"" said Tejas Desai, Continental's head of interior electronics for North America.

Related story: Half of American adults hacked this year

For their part, car manufacturers are working on these problems too.

Ford (F) hardware has built-in firewalls to prevent malicious tampering, and the company has a team of noble hackers constantly probing for weaknesses.

Toyota (TM) does all that too, plus it embeds security chips in the tiny computers throughout the car, narrowing how they communicate and lessening the chance of outsider interference. The company even has forward-thinking plans this year to visit the world's largest hacker conference, Black Hat.

It should be no surprise that Tesla (TSLA) is ahead of the pack. The Model S is the most advanced and connected car currently available. It's worth noting the company's mature approach to addressing vulnerabilities. Instead of hunting down hackers who spot weaknesses, they reward them with an ""Information Security"" badge that works like a Willy Wonka golden ticket, granting exclusive access to Tesla's factory in Fremont, Calif. The company recently sent one to a British hacker who goes by Jon of Bitquark.

But there remains a glaring, three-prong problem beneath all of these security approaches. The car's many little computers will continue to be connected to one another. All auto makers are moving toward Internet-connected cars. And no one is willing to physically separate the core controls from the car's wireless communication hub.

That's partly because federal regulators will soon demand that cars automatically relay information wirelessly to one another as part of the U.S. government's vehicle-to-vehicle communication program. Those car-to-car messages will one day be able to engage brakes -- or your steering wheel.

If decades of computer hacking has shown us anything, it's that smart people will find a way to break in and bounce around.

Scott Morrison, who oversees automotive app engineering at CA Technologies (CA), acknowledged all of these problems exist and said the industry knows what's on the line.

27620,https://www.wired.com/2014/06/hospital-networks-leaking-data/,2014-06-25 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.wired.com,,"Published on 2014-06-25 10:30:00+00:00.  Two researchers examining  the security of hospital networks have found many of them leak valuable information to the internet, leaving critical systems and equipment vulnerable to hacking. The data, which in some cases enumerates every computer and device on a hospital's internal network, would allow hackers to easily locate and map systems to conduct targeted attacks. In at least one case, a large health care organization was spilling info about 68,000 systems connected to its network. At this and every other facility that was leaking data, the problem was an internet-connected computer that was not configured securely. Quite often, the researchers found, these systems also were using unpatched versions of Windows XP still vulnerable to an exploit used by the Conficker worm six years ago. ""Now we know all the targeted info and we know that systems that are publicly connected to the internet are vulnerable to the exploit,"" says Scott Erven, one of the researchers, who plans to discuss their findings today at the Shakacon conference in Hawaii. ""We can exploit them with no user interaction... [then] pivot directly at the medical devices that you want to attack."" Attackers could, for example, infect one of these systems and use it as a launchpad to find and hack the control system that manages embedded pacemakers. Such systems, Erven says, generally require no authentication to administer test shocks to patients or to configure thresholds that determine when a shock is automatically administered. An attacker could therefore alter the settings that determine when a patient is going into cardiac arrest in order to administer shocks when they aren't needed or prevent life-saving shocks from occurring. The data leak that makes it possible for hackers to locate vulnerable systems is the result of network administrators enabling Server Message Block, or SMB, on computers facing the internet and configuring it in such a way that allows data to broadcast externally. SMB is a protocol commonly used by administrators to help quickly identify, locate and communicate with computers and equipment connected to an internal network. With SMB, each system is assigned an ID number or other descriptor to help distinguish, say, the PC in a doctor's office from surgical systems in an operating room or testing equipment in a lab. This kind of information should only be available to network staff. But the researchers found many hospitals had misconfigured the SMB service, allowing outsiders to see it as well. ""Health Care Organizations Are Very Sloppy"" ""It goes to show that health care [organizations are] very sloppy in configuring their external edge networks and are not really taking security seriously,"" Erven says. The vulnerability was uncovered by Erven and Shawn Merdinger, an independent health care security researcher and consultant, expanding on work Erven has done identifying  vulnerabilities in medical devices and hospital equipment . Erven is head of information security for Essentia Health, which operates about 100 facilities–--including clinics, hospitals and pharmacies–--in four states. He and his staff recently completed a two-year investigation into the security of all of Essentia's medical equipment. Among other problems, they found drug infusion pumps---for delivering morphine drips, chemotherapy and antibiotics---that could be remotely manipulated to change dosages delivered to patients; Bluetooth-enabled defibrillators that could be manipulated to deliver random shocks to a patient’s heart or prevent a medically needed shock from occurring; and temperature settings on refrigerators storing blood and drugs that could be reset to cause spoilage. At the time Erven's team conducted their research, they didn't know how many vulnerable medical devices were directly connected to the internet as opposed to simply being connected to internal networks accessible via the internet. Erven and Merdinger set out to scan the internet to answer this question. They scanned for any systems using port 445---the port the SMB protocol uses to transmit data---and filtered for hospitals and other health care organizations while using keywords like ""anesthesia"" and ""defibrillator."" Within half an hour, they discovered a health care organization that was leaking information on 68,000 systems. The organization, which Erven would not identify, has more than 12,000 employees, 3,000 physicians and large cardiovascular and neuroscience institutions associated with it. Among the systems with exposed data, the researchers easily identified at least 32 pacemaker systems in the organization, 21 anesthesiology systems, 488 cardiology systems, and 323 PACS systems---radiology systems for reading X-Rays and other images. They also identified telemetry systems, high-risk systems that are often used in infant-abduction prevention systems as well as for monitoring the movement of elderly patients throughout a hospital to ensure they don't wander off. The problem went beyond this one organization. Because the health care organization's network was connected to third-party networks, data from those networks was exposed as well. Hospital networks often are connected to those of other providers, pharmacies and laboratories. Systems belonging to these other organizations can also be exposed to SMB data leaks if the hospital doesn't configure its own systems properly. Although this organization was the largest one they identified with problems, they soon found others. A Global Healthcare Issue ""We started running organization searches to identify hospitals, clinics, and other medical facilities and we quickly realized this is a global health care organization issue,"" Erven says. ""This is thousands of organizations [that are leaking this information] across the world."" Most hacks involve multiple stages of reconnaissance and varying levels of penetration to reach critical systems and identify vulnerabilities. But in this case, the SMB data would allow an attacker to home in on vulnerable machines quickly instead of having to scan a hospital's entire network, searching for something interesting---an activity that runs the risk of getting them noticed. On some of the networks that were leaking data, the system administrators had assigned names to the systems on their network---such as ""Dr. Armstrong's office,"" or ""cardiology defibrillator in OR1"" making it even easier for hackers to identify specific systems for attack. Armed with this information, as well as the research Erven had previously done to identify vulnerable hospital equipment, an attacker could craft a custom payload to target a specific brand of defibrillators or oncology equipment and send it to a hospital worker via a phishing email. The payload could then seek out the equipment on the network---using the SMB data---and execute its attack only on these specific devices. The attack could even be conducted to target a specific patient. ""The doctor's name doesn’t necessarily help an attacker,"" Erven says. ""But when you know that this patient has an appointment with this doctor and I know this doctor uses this system, you could build a case for a major targeted attack and have more certainty of where you want to target."" Erven says the SMB problem is just one security issue that health care organizations are facing. He says the problems exist because the security teams at these organizations are too often focused solely on HIPAA compliance---checking off boxes to meet government regulations for protecting data---while failing to conduct penetration testing and vulnerability maintenance to really test their systems and secure them the way the security teams at banks and other financial organizations do. In this case, the vulnerability could be easily fixed by simply disabling the SMB service on external-facing systems or reconfiguring it so that it only broadcasts data internally on the hospital's local network instead of broadcasting it out to the internet for hackers to see.",,2023-10-20 04:25:34.026081+00:00,True,True,True,,0.822475452922928,"Hospital Networks Are Leaking Data, Leaving Critical Devices Vulnerable - WIRED",Hospital Networks Leak Valuable Information to the Internet,"The software failure incident occurred when two researchers discovered that many hospital networks were leaking valuable information to the internet, making critical systems and equipment vulnerable to hacking.

The closest any  of us who might have participated in  Facebook's huge social engineering study  came to actually consenting to participate was signing up for the service. Facebook's Data Use Policy warns users that Facebook “may use the information we receive about you…for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement.” This has led to charges that the study violated laws designed to protect human research subjects. But it turns out that those laws don’t apply to the study, and even if they did, it could have been approved, perhaps with some tweaks. Why this is the case requires a bit of explanation. #### Michelle N. Meyer ##### About [Michelle N. Meyer](http://www.michellenmeyer.com/) is an Assistant Professor and Director of Bioethics Policy in the Union Graduate College-Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Bioethics Program, where she writes and teaches at the intersection of law, science, and philosophy. She is a member of the board of three non-profit organizations devoted to scientific research, including the Board of Directors of [PersonalGenomes.org](http://personalgenomes.org/). The Study: Unpredictable and Overstated Results For one week in 2012, Facebook altered the algorithms it uses to determine which status updates appeared in the News Feed of 689,003 randomly selected users (about 1 of every 2,500 Facebook users). The  results of this study were just published  in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). As the authors explain, “[b]ecause people’s friends frequently produce much more content than one person can view,” Facebook ordinarily filters News Feed content “via a ranking algorithm that Facebook continually develops and tests in the interest of showing viewers the content they will find most relevant and engaging.” In this study, the algorithm filtered content based on its emotional content. A post was identified as “positive” or “negative” if it used at least one word identified as positive or negative by software (run automatically without researchers accessing users’ text). Some critics of the experiment have characterized it as one in which the researchers intentionally tried “to make users sad.” With the benefit of hindsight, they claim that the study merely tested the perfectly obvious proposition that reducing the amount of positive content in a user’s News Feed would cause that user to use more negative words and fewer positive words themselves and/or to become less happy (more on the gap between these effects in a minute). But that’s *not *what some prior studies would have predicted. Previous studies both  in the U.S.  and  in Germany  had found that the largely positive, often self-promotional content that Facebook tends to feature has made users feel bitter and resentful---a phenomenon the German researchers memorably call “the self-promotion-envy spiral.” Those studies would have predicted that reducing the positive content in a user’s feed might actually make users  less  sad. And it makes sense that Facebook would want to determine what will make users spend more time on its site rather than close that tab in disgust or despair. The study’s first author, Adam Kramer of  Facebook, confirms  ---on Facebook, of course---that they did indeed want to investigate the theory that seeing friends’ positive content makes users sad. To do so, the researchers conducted two experiments, with a total of four groups of users (about 155,000 each). In the first experiment, Facebook  reduced the positive content  of News Feeds. Each positive post “had between a 10-percent and 90-percent chance (based on their User ID) of being omitted from their News Feed for that specific viewing.” In the second experiment, Facebook  reduced the negative content  of News Feeds in the same manner. In both experiments, these treatment conditions were compared with control conditions in which a similar portion of posts were randomly filtered out (i.e., without regard to emotional content). Note that whatever negativity users were exposed to came from their own friends, not, somehow, from Facebook engineers. In the first, presumably most objectionable, experiment, the researchers chose to filter out varying amounts (10 percent to 90 percent) of friends’ positive content, thereby leaving a News Feed more concentrated with posts in which a user’s friend had written at least one negative word. The results: [f]or people who had positive content reduced in their News Feed, a larger percentage of words in people’s status updates were negative and a smaller percentage were positive. When negativity was reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results suggest that the emotions expressed by friends, via online social networks, influence our own moods, constituting, to our knowledge, the first experimental evidence for massive-scale emotional contagion via social networks. Note two things. First, while statistically significant, these effect sizes are, as the authors acknowledge, quite small. The largest effect size was a mere two hundredths of a standard deviation (d = .02). The smallest was one thousandth of a standard deviation (d = .001). The authors suggest that their findings are primarily significant for public health purposes, because when the aggregated, even small individual effects can have large social consequences. Second, although the researchers conclude that their experiments constitute evidence of “social contagion” ---that is, that “emotional states can be transferred to others”--- this overstates what they could possibly know from this study. The fact that someone exposed to positive words very slightly increased the amount of positive  words  that she then used in her Facebook posts does not necessarily mean that this change in her News Feed content caused any change in her  mood . The very slight increase in the use of positive words could simply be a matter of keeping up (or down, in the case of the reduced positivity experiment) with the Joneses. It seems highly likely that Facebook users experience (varying degrees of) pressure to conform to social norms about acceptable levels of snark and kvetching---and of bragging and pollyannaisms. Someone who is already internally grumbling about how United Statesians are, like, such  total posers  during the World Cup may feel freer to voice that complaint on Facebook than when his feed was more densely concentrated with posts of the “human beings are so great and I feel so lucky to know you all---group hug! feel any worse than they otherwise would have, much less for any increase in negative affect that may have occurred to have risen to the level of a mental health crisis, as some have suggested. Was the Facebook Study ""Human Subjects Research""? One threshold question in determining whether this study required ethical approval by an Internal Review Board is whether it constituted “human subjects research.” An activity is considered “ research ” under the federal regulations, if it is “a systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.” The study was plenty systematic, and it was designed to investigate the “self-promotion-envy spiral” theory of social networks. Check. As defined by the regulations, a “human subject” is “a living individual about whom an investigator... obtains,” inter alia, “data through intervention.” Intervention, in turn, includes “manipulations of the subject or the subject’s environment that are performed for research purposes.” According  to guidance issued by the Office for Human Research Protection s (OHRP), the federal agency tasked with overseeing application of the regulations to HHS-conducted and –funded human subjects research, “orchestrating environmental events or social interactions” constitutes manipulation. I suppose one could argue---in the tradition of choice architecture---that to say that Facebook manipulated its users’ environment is a near tautology. Facebook employs algorithms to filter News Feeds, which it apparently regularly tweaks in an effort to maximize user satisfaction, ideal ad placement, and so on. It may be that Facebook regularly changes the algorithms that determine how a user experiences her News Feed. Given this baseline of constant manipulation, you could say that this study did not involve any incremental additional manipulation. No manipulation, no intervention. No intervention, no human subjects. No human subjects, no federal regulations requiring IRB approval. But… That doesn’t mean that moving from one algorithm to the next doesn’t constitute a manipulation of the user’s environment. Therefore, I assume that this study meets the federal definition of “human subjects research” (HSR). Why the Facebook Study Was Not Subject to Federal Research Regulations Importantly---and contrary to the apparent beliefs of some commentators---not all HSR is subject to the federal regulations, including IRB review. By the  terms of the regulations themselves , HSR is subject to IRB review only when it is conducted or funded by any of several federal departments and agencies (so-called  Common Rule  agencies), or when it will form the basis of an  FDA marketing application . HSR conducted and funded solely by entities like Facebook is not subject to federal research regulations. But this study was not conducted by Facebook alone; the second and third authors on the paper have appointments at the University of California, San Francisco, and Cornell, respectively. Although some commentators assume that university research is only subject to the federal regulations when that research is funded by the government, this, too, is incorrect. Any college or university that accepts any research funds from any Common Rule agency must sign a  Federalwide Assurance (FWA) , a boilerplate contract between the institution and OHRP in which the institution identifies the duly-formed and registered IRB that will review the funded research. The FWA invites institutions to voluntarily commit to extend the requirement of IRB review from funded projects to  all  human subject research in which the institution is engaged, regardless of the source of funding. Historically, the vast majority of colleges and universities have agreed to “check the box,” as it’s called. If you are a student or a faculty member at an institution that has checked the box, then any HSR you conduct must be approved by an IRB. As I recently had  occasion to discover , Cornell has indeed checked the box ( see #5 here ).  UCSF appears to have done so , as well, although it’s possible that it simply requires IRB review of all HSR by institutional policy, rather than FWA contract. But these FWAs only require IRB review if the two authors’ participation in the Facebook study meant that Cornell and UCSF were “engaged” in research. When an institution is “engaged in research” turns out to be an important legal question in much collaborative research, and one the Common Rule itself doesn’t address. OHRP, however, has issued (non-binding, of course)  guidance  on the matter. The general rule is that an institution is engaged in research when its employee or agent obtains data about subjects through intervention or interaction, identifiable private information about subjects, or subjects’ informed consent. According to the author contributions section of the PNAS paper, the Facebook-affiliated author “performed [the] research” and “analyzed [the] data.”  The two academic authors merely helped him design the research and write the paper.  They would not seem to have been involved, then, in obtaining either data or informed consent. (And even if the academic authors had gotten their hands on individualized data, so long as that data remained coded by Facebook user ID numbers that did not allow them to readily ascertain subjects’ identities, OHRP would not consider them to have been engaged in research.) >Because the two academic authors merely designed the research and wrote the paper, they would not seem to have been involved, then, in obtaining either data or informed consent. It would seem, then, that neither UCSF nor Cornell was ""engaged in research"" and, since Facebook was engaged in HSR but is not subject to the federal regulations, that IRB approval was not required. Whether that’s a good or a bad thing is a separate question, of course. (A  previous report  that the Cornell researcher had received funding from the Army Research Office, which as part of the Department of Defense, a Common Rule agency, would have triggered IRB review, has been retracted.) In fact, as this piece went to press on Monday afternoon, Cornell’s media relations had  just issued a statement  that provided exactly this explanation for why it determined that IRB review was not required. Did an Internal Review Board Review the Facebook Experiment, and if So, How Could It Have Approved It? Princeton psychologist Susan Fiske, who edited the PNAS article, told a Los Angeles Times reporter  the following : But  then Forbes reported  that Fiske “misunderstood the nature of the approval. A source familiar with the matter says the study was approved only through an internal review process at Facebook, not through a university Institutional Review Board.” Most recently, Fiske  told  the Atlantic that Cornell's IRB did indeed review the study, and approved it as having involved a ""pre-existing dataset."" Given that, according to the PNAS paper, the two academic researchers collaborated with the Facebook researcher in designing the research, it strikes me as disingenuous to claim that the dataset preexisted the academic researchers' involvement. As I suggested above, however, it does strike me as correct to conclude that, given the academic researchers' particular contributions to the study, neither UCSF nor Cornell was engaged in research, and hence that IRB review was not required at all. >It strikes me as disingenuous to claim that the dataset preexisted the academic researchers' involvement. But if an IRB  had  reviewed it, could it have approved it, consistent with a plausible interpretation of the Common Rule?  The answer, I think, is Yes,  although under the federal regulations, the study ought to have required a bit more informed consent than was present here (about which more below). Many have expressed outrage that any IRB could approve this study, and there has been speculation about the possible grounds the IRB might have given. The  Atlantic suggests  that the “experiment is almost certainly legal. In the company’s current terms of service, Facebook users relinquish the use of their data for ‘data analysis, testing, [and] research.’” But once a study is under an IRB’s jurisdiction, the IRB is obligated to apply the standards of informed consent set out in the  federal regulations , which go well,  well beyond  a one-time click-through consent to unspecified “research.” Facebook’s own terms of service are simply not relevant. Not directly, anyway. >Facebook’s own terms of service are simply not relevant. Not directly, anyway. According to Prof. Fiske’s now-uncertain report of her conversation with the authors, by contrast, the local IRB approved the study “on the grounds that Facebook apparently manipulates people’s News Feeds all the time.”  This  fact actually  is  relevant to a proper application of the Common Rule to the study. Here’s how. Section 46.116(d) of the regulations provides: An IRB may approve a consent procedure which does not include, or which alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set forth in this section, or waive the requirements to obtain informed consent provided the IRB finds and documents that: 1. The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects; 2. The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; 3. The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration; and 4. Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation. The Common Rule  defines  “minimal risk” to mean “that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life.”  The IRB might plausibly have decided that since the subjects’ environments, like those of all Facebook users, are constantly being manipulated by Facebook, the study’s risks were no greater than what the subjects experience in daily life as regular Facebook users, and so the study posed no more than “minimal risk” to them. That strikes me as a winning argument, unless there’s something about this manipulation of users’ News Feeds that was significantly riskier than other Facebook manipulations. It’s hard to say, since we don’t know all the ways the company adjusts its algorithms---or the effects of most of these unpublicized manipulations. Even if you don’t buy that Facebook regularly manipulates users’ emotions (and recall, again, that it’s not clear that the experiment in fact did alter users’ emotions), other actors intentionally manipulate our emotions every day. Consider “ fear appeals ”---ads and other messages intended to shape the recipient’s behavior by making her feel a negative emotion (usually fear, but also sadness or distress). Examples include “scared straight” programs for youth warning of the dangers of alcohol, smoking, and drugs, and singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan’s ASPCA  animal cruelty donation appeal  (which I cannot watch without becoming upset—YMMV--and there’s no way on earth I’m being dragged to the “ emotional manipulation ” that is, according to one critic, The Fault in Our Stars). Continuing with the rest of the § 46.116(d) criteria, the IRB might also plausibly have found that participating in the study without Common Rule-type informed consent would not “adversely effect the rights and welfare of the subjects,” since Facebook has limited users’ rights by requiring them to agree that their information may be used “for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement.” __Finally, the study couldn’t feasibly have been conducted with full Common Rule-style informed consent--which requires a statement of the purpose of the research and the specific risks that are foreseen--without biasing the entire study. __Of course, surely the IRB, without biasing the study, could have required researchers to provide subjects with  some  information about this specific study beyond the single word “research” that appears in the general Data Use Policy, as well as the opportunity to decline to participate in this particular study, and these things should have been required on a plain reading of § 46.116(d). In other words, the study was probably eligible for “alteration” in some of the elements of informed consent otherwise required by the regulations, but not for a blanket waiver. Moreover, subjects should have been debriefed by Facebook and the other researchers, not left to read media accounts of the study and wonder whether they were among the randomly-selected subjects studied. Still, the bottom line is that---assuming the experiment required IRB approval at all---it was probably approvable in some form that involved much less than 100 percent disclosure about exactly what Facebook planned to do and why. Two Ways of Viewing “Minimal Risk” Bootstrapping There are (at least) two ways of thinking about this feedback loop between the risks we encounter in daily life and what counts as “minimal risk” research for purposes of the federal regulations. One view is that once upon a time, the primary sources of emotional manipulation in a person’s life were called “toxic people,” and once you figured out who those people were, you would avoid them as much as possible. Now, everyone’s trying to nudge, data mine, or manipulate you into doing or feeling or not doing or not feeling something, and they have access to you 24/7 through targeted ads, sophisticated algorithms, and so on, and the ubiquity is being further used against us by watering down human subjects research protections. There’s something to that lament. The other view is that this bootstrapping is entirely appropriate. If Facebook had acted on its own, it could have tweaked its algorithms to cause more or fewer positive posts in users’ News Feeds even *without *obtaining users’ click-through consent (it’s not as if Facebook promises its users that it will feed them their friends’ status updates in any particular way), and certainly without going through the IRB approval process. It’s only once someone tries to learn something about the effects of that activity and share that knowledge with the world that we throw up obstacles. >Would we have ever known the extent to which Facebook manipulates its News Feed algorithms had Facebook not collaborated with academics incentivized to publish their findings? Academic researchers’ status as academics already makes it more burdensome for them to engage in exactly the same kinds of studies that corporations like Facebook can engage in at will. If, on top of that, IRBs didn’t recognize our society’s shifting expectations of privacy (and manipulation) and incorporate those evolving expectations into their minimal risk analysis, that would make academic research still harder, and would only serve to help ensure that those who are most likely to study the effects of a manipulative practice and share those results with the rest of us have reduced incentives to do so. Would we have ever known the extent to which Facebook manipulates its News Feed algorithms had Facebook not collaborated with academics incentivized to publish their findings? We can certainly have a conversation about the appropriateness of Facebook-like manipulations, data mining, and other 21st-century practices. But so long as we allow private entities to engage freely in these practices, we ought not unduly restrain academics trying to determine their effects. Recall those fear appeals I mentioned above. As one social psychology doctoral candidate noted on Twitter, IRBs make it impossible to study the effects of appeals that carry the same intensity of fear as real-world appeals to which people are exposed routinely, and on a mass scale, with unknown consequences. That doesn’t make a lot of sense. What corporations can do at will to serve their bottom line, and non-profits can do to serve their cause, we shouldn’t make (even) harder---or impossible---for those seeking to produce generalizable knowledge to do This post originally appeared on The Faculty Lounge under the headline  How an IRB Could Have Legitimately Approved the Facebook Experiment—and Why that May Be a Good Thing .*",,2023-10-20 04:25:49.082998+00:00,True,False,,,,Everything You Need to Know About Facebook's Controversial Emotion Experiment - WIRED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28634,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/02/isp-gchq-mass-surveillance-privacy-court-claim,2014-07-02 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2014-07-02 00:00:00. Internet service providers from around the world are lodging formal complaints against the UK government's monitoring service, GCHQ, alleging it uses malicious software to break into their networks.

The claims from seven organisations based in six countries – Germany, the Netherlands, South Korea, the UK, the US and Zimbabwe – will add to international pressure on the government after Edward Snowden's revelations about mass surveillance of the internet by UK and US intelligence agencies.

The claims are being filed with the investigatory powers tribunal (IPT), the court in London that assesses complaints about the agencies' activities and misuse of surveillance by government organisations. Most of its hearings are held at least partly in secret.

The IPT is already considering a number of related submissions. Later this month it will investigate complaints by human rights groups about the way social media sites have been targeted by GCHQ.

The government has defended the security services, pointing out that online searches are often routed overseas and those deemed ""external communications"" can be monitored without the need for an individual warrant. Critics say that such a legal interpretation sidesteps the need for traditional safeguards.

The latest claim is against both GCHQ, located near Cheltenham, and the Foreign Office. It is based on articles published this year in the German magazine Der Spiegel, which alleged that GCHQ had carried out an attack codenamed Operation Socialist on the Belgian telecoms group Belgacom, targeting individual employees with malware (malicious software).

One technique was a ""man in the middle"" attack, which, according to the documents filed at the IPT, bypasses encryption software and ""operates by interposing the attacker [GCHQ] between two computers that believe that they are securely communicating with each other.

""In fact, each is communicating with GCHQ, who collect the communications, as well as relaying them in the hope that the interference will be undetected.""

The complaint alleges that the attacks were a breach of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and an interference with the privacy rights of the employees under the European convention on human rights.

The organisations targeted, the submission states, were all ""responsible and professional internet service providers"".

The claimants are: the Chaos Computer Club in Germany; Greenhost in the Netherlands; Jinbonet in South Korea; GreenNet in the UK; Riseup Networks and May First/People Link in the US; and Mango Email Service in Zimbabwe.

Their complaint follows articles about mass surveillance in the Guardian based on material released by Snowden.

Among the programs said to have been operating were Turbine, which automates the injection of data and can infect millions of machines, and Warrior Pride, which enables microphones on iPhones and Android devices to be remotely activated.

The action has been supported by Privacy International, a UK charity that defends and promotes the right to privacy across the world. It points out that: ""While the claimants were not directly named in the Snowden documents, the type of surveillance being carried out allows them to challenge the practices in the IPT because they and their users are at threat of being targeted.""

Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International, said: ""These widespread attacks on providers and collectives undermine the trust we all place on the internet and greatly endangers the world's most powerful tool for democracy and free expression.

""It completely cripples our confidence in the internet economy and threatens the rights of all those who use it. These unlawful activities, run jointly by GCHQ and the NSA [National Security Agency], must come to an end immediately.""

Cedric Knight of GreenNet said: ""Snowden's revelations have exposed GCHQ's view that independent operators like GreenNet are legitimate targets for internet surveillance, so we could be unknowingly used to collect data on our users.

""Our long-established network of NGOs and charities, or simply individuals who value our independent and ethical standpoint, rely on us for a level of integrity they can't get from mainstream ISPs. Our entire modus operandi is threatened by this illegal and intrusive mass surveillance.""

Devin Theriot-Orr of Riseup.net said: ""People have a fundamental right to communicate with each other free from pervasive government surveillance. The right to communicate, and the ability to choose to do so secretly, is essential to the open exchange of ideas which is a cornerstone of a free society. GCHQ must stop its illegal monitoring activities.""

Yeokyung Chang, ICT policy activist at Jinbonet, said: ""We are all equal users and citizens in the internet. The right to privacy of users all over the world should be protected equally and should not be infringed by any government.""

Sacha van Geffen, CEO of Greenhost, said: ""Outsider intrusion such as that of the GCHQ criminalises all the users of the network without legal ground and causes damage to fundamental processes that keep the network running. This illicit activity is not only a blatant violation of human rights but also endangers innocent lives. It must stop at once.""

Alfredo López, co-founder of May First/People Link, said: ""Using the internet for surveillance and violations of privacy is an obscene betrayal of the reasons for the internet's creation and development.""

Jan Girlich at the Chaos Computer Club in Germany said: ""The GCHQ's dragnet surveillance takes away all citizens' privacy rights indiscriminately. Thus, not only lawyers, doctors, journalists, and many more people are robbed of their working basis, but everybody is stripped of his or her ability to object to their government's opinion without fear of retribution.

""Monitoring all communications secretively and without any effective control nor checks and balances breaks the foundations on which our modern democracies are based. We are heading towards a police state and the only way to stop this is to bring mass surveillance to an end.""",,2023-10-20 06:44:28.084483+00:00,True,True,False,,,ISPs take GCHQ to court in UK over mass surveillance - The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29062,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/21/soundcloud-ads-musicians-major-labels,2014-08-21 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2014-08-21 00:00:00. With 175 million monthly listeners, SoundCloud is the second biggest streaming music service in the world behind YouTube. Yet it hasn’t paid royalties to the creators and rightsholders of that music for their plays on its site and apps.

Artists and labels that have uploaded songs to SoundCloud have by and large accepted that they’re getting something else out of it: a way to build an audience of fans, and get data on how and where their tracks are being listened to.

But as SoundCloud has grown and raised more funding – its $60m round in January 2014 valued the company at $700m – the company has faced more pointed questions about when it plans to start paying royalties, including from major labels and publishers.

Today, SoundCloud is taking its first step along that road, albeit in a carefully-controlled way with a select group of invited partners in the US for its new “On SoundCloud” initiative.

Those creators will have advertising shown or played alongside their music (or other audio content), and will get “the majority” of the money paid to SoundCloud by that advertiser – it’s a share of revenues rather than a set per-stream payment.

Carefully-controlled? The ads will only be seen and heard in the US for now, on SoundCloud’s own website and mobile apps – not in tracks embedded elsewhere on the web and/or listened to elsewhere in the world.

“We see the program as something for all creators. We’re launching with a small set, but ultimately we want to get all creators, whether music or audio, big or small, all over the world to be able to make use of it,” SoundCloud chief executive Alexander Ljung told The Guardian.

“It’s almost the third chapter for SoundCloud. We started off building great tools for creators to be able to make use of the web, then our second chapter was making it much more accessible for listeners, so those creators could build a much larger audience. This third chapter is about allowing people to start monetising that audience.”

Ljung was keen to stress that the control that creators have under the new program, once they’re part of it: including the ability to turn on advertising for certain tracks, rather than having to have ads on everything they upload.

What will the ads be? A mixture of radio-style audio ads, display advertising on mobile, “native advertising” including promotion of SoundCloud tracks and profiles, and sponsorships and contests where brands work with individual creators. Launch advertisers will include Red Bull, Jaguar and Comedy Central.

“We wanted to avoid this being a bunch of unthought-through ads in your face. You won’t open the site up and see a bunch of banner ads plastered everywhere. It’s elegant,” said Ljung. “Our set of launch advertisers have done a really great job: the experience around the ads feels good.”

Note, introducing advertising will be followed in the nearish future by the introduction of a subscription option for SoundCloud listeners, who’ll be able to pay an (as yet undisclosed) monthly fee not to encounter the ads.

What hasn’t been announced today are any licensing deals with major labels, despite reports in July that Universal Music, Sony Music and Warner Music were all in talks with SoundCloud to take stakes of between 3% and 5% in the company and start getting royalties from streams of their catalogues.

Those talks, it seems, are still ongoing. “We are in a lot of other conversations with both big and small creators, and there will be a lot more that will join On SoundCloud over the next weeks and months,” was Ljung’s comment today.

The challenge for SoundCloud and its music industry partners alike is finding the right balance. On the one hand, there’s the positive and important step of musicians and songwriters getting paid for streams of their work.

On the other, the prospect of the major labels squeezing the company until its pips squeak by taking equity stakes, large “advance” payments and per-stream payouts on top that SoundCloud’s advertising income may not be able to keep pace with.

The latter prospect is clouded further by a growing debate about how (or even whether) advance payments to labels and any profits they make from their equity stakes when these digital services go public or get bought are passed on to artists and songwriters.

According to Ljung, SoundCloud wants to be paying all levels of the music industry, from individual artists uploading their own music through to the largest majors – two publishers, Sony/ATV and BMG, are already partners for On SoundCloud.

“I think this is a huge moment for the industry, and a huge opportunity for the industry to not just reach more people, but to monetise it and make that a core part of the overall business,” he said.

“We’re starting it today with a select group of partners, but it’s clear to everybody that the ambition is to get everyone on there. That would be a huge deal for the industry and for creators.”",,2023-10-20 08:44:42.668070+00:00,True,False,,,,SoundCloud introduces ads so it can pay musicians and other creators - The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following reports of more than 100 private celebrity photos being stolen and leaked online, experts have voiced their concern over how hackers managed to access the images.

The hackers claim they stole the photos from the iCloud accounts of the celebrities involved, which includes Jennifer Lawrence, Kelly Brook and Rihanna.

Now a variety of theories - including a flaw in the 'Find My iPhone' service as well as 'social engineering' techniques - have begun to circulate in a bid to explain what might be to blame for the hack.

Scroll down for video



These images were reportedly stolen from iCloud accounts and include private images of Jennifer Lawrence and Kelly Brook. It is not clear how the hacker gained access to the images, although reports state a flaw was discovered in the Find my iPhone service that would have left it open to a 'brute force' attack

PHOTO LEAK: THE THEORIES

Find My iPhone flaw

Reports suggest a specific flaw in the 'Find My iPhone' service may have been to blame. Code was spotted on software development site Github, that would have allowed malicious users to use ‘brute force’ to gain an account’s password on Apple iCloud, and in particular its Find my iPhone service. Social engineering The hackers may have also used ‘social engineering’ techniques to obtain Apple IDs and passwords based on other information.

This includes email address, a mother’s maiden name, a date of birth, and more - all of which is easier to find out about celebrities than the everyday user. If a celebrity uses the same password across accounts, this would be then make it relatively easy for someone to hack if they had the right information. Google Drive hack In June, Google announced its Drive service had a flaw that meant private information was at risk from hackers.

Google patched the flaw in June, but the large number of victims in the 4chan leak also suggests that the hack may have begun months ago – at the time of this flaw. Dropbox flaw Similarly, in May, a flaw was found in Dropbox accounts that could have given unauthorised access to accounts.

The phone photos, reportedly obtained through the widely-used online service, were published on 4chan, the anonymous image-sharing forum.

A list of the alleged victims - 101 in total - posted by the hacker has also appeared.

Apple has not commented on the leak, but has previously stressed how important its customers’ privacy is.



The firm's iCloud service secures data by encrypting it when it is sent over the web, storing it in an encrypted format when kept on server, and using secure tokens for authentication.

This means that data is protected from hackers while it is being sent to devices and stored online.

This suggests the hackers were able to obtain the login credentials of the accounts, and pretend to be the user, in order to bypass this encryption.

Earlier today The Next Web spotted code on software development site Github, that would have allowed malicious users to use ‘brute force’ to gain an account’s password on Apple iCloud, and in particular its Find my iPhone service.

Brute force, also known as 'brute force cracking', is a trial-and-error method used to get plain-text passwords from encrypted data.

Just as a criminal might break into, or 'crack' a safe by trying many possible combinations, a brute-force cracking attempt goes through all possible combinations of characters in sequence.

In a six-letter attack, the hacker will start at 'a' and end at '//////'

Find My iPhone helps users locate and protect their iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Mac - if it’s ever lost or stolen.

The hackers may have also used ‘social engineering’ techniques to obtain Apple IDs and passwords based on other information they could find.

This includes email address, a mother’s maiden name, a date of birth, and more - all of which is easier to find out about celebrities than the everyday user.

The flaw was spotted by The Next Web on Github (screengrab pictured). Brute force, also known as brute force cracking, is a trial-and-error method used by to get plain-text passwords from encrypted data. It was live for two days before Apple patched the vulnerability

Actress Mary E Winstead confirmed photos on 4Chan were hers, but stressed that she had deleted them ‘long ago.’ But, when photos that have been uploaded to iCloud are deleted from a phone, they are not necessarily deleted from the online storage. They would also appear on the photo streams of any synced devices

WHAT IS A BRUTE FORCE ATTACK? Earlier today The Next Web spotted code on Github that would have allowed malicious users to ‘brute force’ an account’s password on Apple iCloud, and in particular its Find my iPhone service. Brute force, also known as brute force cracking, is a trial-and-error method used by to get plain-text passwords from encrypted data. Just as a criminal might break into, or 'crack' a safe by trying many possible combinations, a brute-force cracking attempt goes through all possible combinations of characters in sequence. In a six-letter attack, the hacker will start at 'a' and end at '//////' The hackers may have also used ‘social engineering’ techniques to obtain Apple IDs and passwords based on other information they could find. This includes email address, a mother’s maiden name, a date of birth, and more - all of which is easier to find out about celebrities than the everyday user. If a celebrity uses the same password across accounts, this would be relatively easy for someone to hack if they had the right information.

If a celebrity uses the same password across accounts, this would be then make it relatively easy for someone to hack if they had the right information.

But, the sheer number of names on the list makes this unlikely – unless a large number of hackers were taking part, and a large number of celebrities had poor password management.

Rob Cotton, CEO at web security experts NCC Group said: 'People often point the finger at technology when they've been the victim of a cyber attack, but poor password choices or naivety in the face of a seemingly innocent email is regularly to blame.""

Human error, in a variety of ways, said Mr Cotton, often play a part.

‘Last year NCC Group successfully compromised the iCloud account of a journalist as part of an authorised demonstration using a mixture of social engineering techniques and subterfuge - and the amount of information we were able to access was shocking,’ he continued.

Separately, Wired reporter Mat Honan had his iCloud account breached and his devices wiped after hackers used a mixture of public information and social engineering when contacting Apple technical support, in order to gain access.

Raj Samani, EMEA CTO, McAfee, part of Intel Security told MailOnline: 'Almost every service used online requires a password, and to ensure your passwords are secure, they must be complex.



'Making a strong password isn’t hard, but practising safe browsing can be. Take the time to take stock of your passwords and your password habits.

'If storing sensitive content on the cloud, ensure that you are using ultra-secure cloud storage that uses a form of biometric authentication. This provides a seamless way to interact securely, adding another layer of protection to keep your personal data secure online.'

The victims included actress Jennifer Lawrence (pictured) who was said to have had 60 nude selfies stolen from her account. A spokesman for Lawrence confirmed the photos were genuine and said 'the authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence'

iCloud secures data by encrypting it when it is sent over the web, storing it in an encrypted format when kept on server, and using secure tokens for authentication (explained above). This suggests the hackers were able to obtain the login credentials of the accounts, and pretend to be the user, in order to bypass this encryption

In May, iPhone and iPad users were being targeted by hackers who were remotely locking their devices and demanding ransom money in return.

Ransomware attacks, in which criminals remotely gain access to a device and hold it hostage, aren’t new, but they have traditionally targeted laptops and PCs.

In this latest mobile attack, the hackers were controlling gadgets by breaking into customers' iCloud accounts and remotely locking the devices using the Find My iPhone feature.



AM I AT RISK? If a flaw in the iCloud service was to blame, any customer could have been at risk. iCloud’s My Photo Stream feature uploads new photos to the cloud as soon as the device is connected to Wi-Fi; this is to keep photos synchronised across all your devices. Disabling this option prevents photos automatically being uploaded. Be aware that deleting a photo from a device does not mean it has been deleted from your online storage account. The photos may also appear in photo streams on other devices, and any phone or tablet that is synced with that iCloud account. This means you should delete photos from all of these areas if you want to get rid of them permanently. In order to make your private data more secure, you should cherry-pick the data you store in the cloud and know when the data is set to automatically leave your device. You should also choose a hard to crack password, and not use that password on any other account.

Stefano Ortolani, security researcher at Kaspersky Lab told MailOnline: ‘The leak is still under scrutiny, so it is not clear at this stage if cloud services are to blame, or if those are just files somehow leaked from a private collection.

‘The security of a cloud service depends on the provider.

‘However, it’s important to consider that as soon as you hand over any data, including photos, to a third-party service, you need to be aware that you automatically lose some control of it. This is also the case for when you upload something online.

‘In order to make your private data more secure, you should cherry-pick the data you store in the cloud and know when the data is set to automatically leave your device.’

For example, iCloud’s My Photo Stream feature uploads new photos to the cloud as soon as the device is connected to Wi-Fi; this is to keep photos synchronised across all your devices.

Disabling this option prevents photos automatically being uploaded.

Actress Mary E Winstead confirmed photos on 4Chan were hers, but stressed that she had deleted them ‘long ago.’

But, when photos that have been uploaded to iCloud are deleted from a phone, they are not necessarily deleted from the online storage.

Apart from iCloud, the photos also remain on the user’s Photo Stream, which would also be available on other devices with which the photos streams were share, such as an iPad or iPod touch, or devices synced with the same iCloud account.

Eduard Meelhuysen, VP EMEA at Netskope told MailOnline: 'We don’t know the exact details of this breach yet, but it would be interesting to know if the people caught up in this case observed good password hygiene.



'People need to choose their cloud storage tools carefully. If it’s a free tool, ask yourself: why is it free? And would your data be more secure with another provider? For very private or personal data, it might make sense to pay for a service which offers higher levels of security.



'It’s also important to actually read the terms and conditions for cloud storage solutions. Very few people do this and it’s not going to be anyone’s favourite job, but this process can help consumers understand where and how their data is being stored.'



If the leak didn’t come from compromised iCloud accounts, they may have originated from other cloud services such as Google Drive, Dropbox or similar.

If the leak didn’t come from iCloud accounts, they may have originated from other cloud devices such as Google Drive. In June, Google announced its Drive service had a flaw that meant private information was at risk. The flaw was patched, but the large number of 4chan victims suggests the hack may have begun months ago

WHAT IS FIND MY IPHONE? Find My iPhone helps users locate and protect their iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Mac - if it’s ever lost or stolen. With Find My iPhone set up on a device, it locates a device on a map, can play a sound to help users find their phone, use Lost Mode to lock and track it, or remotely delete all personal information. With iOS 7 or later, Find My iPhone includes a feature called Activation Lock, which is turned on automatically when Find My iPhone is switched on. Activation Lock makes it harder for anyone to use or sell an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch if it’s lost or stolen. With Activation Lock, the Apple ID and password are required before anyone can disable Find My iPhone, sign out of iCloud, or erase and reactivate the device.

In June, Google announced its Drive service had a flaw that meant private information was at risk from hackers.

The security flaw occurred when a file was uploaded to Google Drive, was stored in its original format and contained links to third-party websites.

In this instance, if a user clicked on the embedded link, the administrator of that site could potentially obtain information about the URL of the original document – exposing it to hackers.

Google patched the flaw in June, but the large number of victims in the 4chan leak also suggests that the hack may have begun months ago – at the time of this flaw.

Similarly, in May, a flaw was found in Dropbox accounts that could have given unauthorised access to accounts.

A bug in the processor that powers the popular Tesco Hudl tablet could be leaving private data at risk.

Investigations carried out by security researchers and the BBC discovered that they could retrieve ‘deleted’ data from second-hand models of the device.

Experts typically advise carrying out a factory reset to remove data from any gadget, but the investigation has revealed this technique may not always work on the supermarket’s tablet.

Investigations carried out security researchers and the BBC discovered that they could retrieve ‘deleted’ data from second-hand models of Tesco's Hudl tablet (pictured). Using free software, a security expert obtained unlock codes, Wi-Fi and site passwords, and browsing history

The investigations involved second-hand gadgets bought on auction sites, including eBay, and included 10 Hudls.

SECURITY FLAWS IN ANDROID Earlier this year, researchers from Avast found they were able to pull tens of thousands of photos, emails, text messages and more from used phones being on eBay that previous owners had thought they had 'wiped' clean. Aside from 40,000 photos and 250 ‘compromising’ selfies of men, the company was even able to discover the identity of several sellers, and one person’s completed loan application. Only one phone had third-party security software installed, and it actually gave up the most personal information of all. In response to the findings, Google said: 'This research looks to be based on old devices and versions (pre-Android 3.0) and does not reflect the security protections in Android versions that are used by the vast majority of users. 'If you sell or dispose of your device, we recommend you enable encryption on your device and apply a factory reset beforehand; this has been available on Android for over three years.'

The BBC, with help from Ken Munro, security expert at Pen Test Partners, said the Hudl was vulnerable because of a bug in its Rockchip processor’s firmware.

Using free software, Mr Munro discovered that the flaw in the firmware meant he could read data stored on it, as well as write to it.

He uncovered data including unlock codes, Wi-Fi and site passwords and browsing history.

Tesco said that devices returned to the stores have personal data wiped, and advised customers to use data wiping software, as well as carrying out a factory reset, to make sure the information is removed.

Sven Boddington, vice president of global marketing and client solutions at computer firm Teleplan told MailOnline: ‘To say it's worrying to find tablet devices are being sold with data still on them is an understatement.

‘This is not the first instance, we’re constantly seeing this kind of story in the news.

‘It’s not good enough to delete the personal data to only a ‘basic standard’ or worse still, not at all as there is an obligation to comply with data protection laws.’

The failure was discovered by security researchers and the BBC during investigations involving second-hand models of the device purchased from auction sites. The bug in the firmware allowed the retrieval of ""deleted"" data from these tablets. The impact of the failure was that personal data, including unlock codes, Wi-Fi and site passwords, and browsing history, could be accessed by unauthorized individuals. The responsible entity for the failure was the Rockchip processor's firmware, which had the vulnerability. The impacted entities were the users of the Tesco Hudl tablet, particularly those who sold or disposed of their devices without properly wiping the data. Tesco advised customers to use data wiping software and perform a factory reset to ensure the removal of personal information. The incident highlighted the importance of complying with data protection laws and properly deleting personal data from devices before selling or disposing of them. Google responded to similar findings by stating that the research was based on old devices and versions of Android, and did not reflect the security protections in newer versions used by the majority

Diaz said: 'If these guys can do it to this group then everyone's vulnerable'

Hollywood actress Cameron Diaz, who is currently promoting a new film about a homemade sex tape going public, has called the leak of nude and explicit images of dozens of female celebrities 'a major violation'.

She said members of the public should consider how they would feel if they had been targeted in the wake of the iCloud hacking which saw nude images of 101 famous faces circulated on the internet.

She spoke out after high-profile stars such as Hunger Games actress Jennifer Lawrence, model Cara Delevingne and former Downton Abbey star Jessica Brown Findlay were named among those who had compromising pictures posted online after their accounts were apparently hacked.

Hollywood actress Cameron Diaz (pictured on ITV's This Morning) said the apparent iCloud hacking which saw dozens of nude and explicit photographs of high-profile celebrities leaked on the internet was a 'major violation'

The actress, who appeared on the daytime show with co-star Jason Segel, was promoting new film Sex Tape

Diaz made the comments today as she attended several press calls for her new film Sex Tape – which follows a couple who make a homemade explicit film only for it be accidentally distributed to their friends and family.

Speaking on ITV's This Morning, Diaz said: 'Whoever has done it, they will be caught and made examples of. This can happen to anyone. If these guys can do it to this group of people then everyone's vulnerable to it.

'I think that people really need to look at... how would they feel if it happened to them?'

Her co-star Jason Segel said: 'What happened in real life is a terrible crime. And it's very easy when you use the word ""celebrity"" to take away the human aspect but there is an actual person with a life, you know.'

Technology giant Apple last night said the leaks were not a result of breaches in the security of its computer systems.

The US firm said none of the cases it had so far investigated were a result of its iCloud or Find my iPhone systems being hacked but as a result of a 'very targeted attack' on the security procedures of celebrity accounts.

Model Cara Delevingne (left) and Hunger Games actress Jennifer Lawrence were both victims of the hacking

The leaking of the private photos of famous female stars sparked initial suggestions that Apple's iCloud service had been compromised to access the images and leak them across the internet.

The photos have led to a backlash against the unknown hacker who is accused of violating the privacy of the women involved. A police investigation is under way to identify the culprit.

Spider-Man actress Kirsten Dunst, who is also reportedly a victim of the leak, seemed to point the finger of blame when she tweeted: 'Thank you iCloud.'

But in a statement Apple said: 'When we learned of the theft, we were outraged and immediately mobilised Apple's engineers to discover the source. Our customers' privacy and security are of utmost importance to us.

'After more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet.

'None of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of Apple's systems including iCloud or Find my iPhone.

'We are continuing to work with law enforcement to help identify the criminals involved.'

The film follows a couple who make a private sex tape only to find it has been accidentally shared to the public

FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said it was 'aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusions and the unlawful release of material involving high-profile individuals, and is addressing the matter'.

Other stars said to have been affected include Avril Lavigne, Cat Deeley and Rihanna, with actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whose movies include A Good Day To Die Hard, already acknowledging pictures in which she is featured are genuine.

A piece of computer code that repeatedly guesses passwords has been found online. The script was posted to software site GitHub, but a message has since appeared saying that Apple had fixed the bug.

According to the post, the script uses the top 500 most common passwords approved by Apple to try to gain access to user accounts. If successful, it would give the hacker full access to the iCloud account, including photographs.",,2023-10-20 11:07:23.435638+00:00,True,False,,,,Cameron Diaz calls iCloud hacking and leaked photos 'major violation' - Daily Mail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29838,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/17/sell-childs-tablet-ebay-privacy,2014-09-17 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2014-09-17 00:00:00. Parents understandably don’t want to spend excessive amounts of money on tablets for their children. Many choose to buy relatively low-cost Android devices from the supermarket, such as Tesco’s Hudl or Aldi’s Lifetab.

Once the kids are done with the tablet, mums and dads often flog them on eBay to recover some of the expense. But researchers have warned this could be a privacy nightmare in waiting, as wiping functions on these devices have been known to fail, leaving data accessible to their buyers.

Ken Munro, from security firm Pen Test Partners, told the Guardian that the Hudl, Lifetab and the Moshi Monsters-branded tablet all failed to properly delete information when using Android’s wipe feature.



After buying 20 devices from eBay, all of which cost less than £20 each, Munro discovered he was able to extract information including passwords for social networks, private photos and browsing history of minors. By looking at the apps, internet searches and passwords found across the 20 devices, the researchers determined six had been used by children.

Amongst the data recovered from the tablets were photos of children. There were also passwords to Twitter, Amazon and Steam accounts, as well as login tokens to Gmail, Google Play, Google Plus and YouTube accounts, meaning these accounts could have been compromised.

Parents would be horrified to learn their child’s data could be accessed so easily, Munro said. “Our most significant concern is that predators could buy cheap, used tablets from online auction sites and other sources. Using simple tools, they could recover children’s data and passwords,” he said.

“This could allow the predator to access their social networks directly, making for terrifying cyber-stalking from inside their social network account. They would have access to your child’s account.”

The problem lies in tablets with a range of Rockchip processors, which remain vulnerable today, though the manufacturer is planning to release a fix.

The flaw allowed anyone who acquired an affected tablet to read data that wasn’t successfully deleted by the factory reset option in Android settings. Munro’s team of researchers used the freely available ‘rkflashtool’ to get at memory in the chips on the device and read the data.

Whilst some blame lies with Rockchip, the vendors “should have been through an assurance process”, Munro added. “Given the tools have been around for 18 months, then you expect things to improve.”

Tesco recognised the issues earlier this year, saying it was able to wipe Hudl devices of all information if returned to them. “Customers should always ensure all personal information is removed prior to giving away or selling any mobile device. To guarantee this, customers should use a data wipe program,” a spokesperson told The Guardian.

Mind Candy, the creator of Moshi Monsters, said its device was no longer being made, but directed the Guardian’s enquiry on to Ingo, which made the tablet and creates various devices for children.

It had not provided comment at the time of the publication. Neither Rockchip nor Aldi had offered comment either.

“Rockchip is working on a fix right now,” noted Munro. “We’ve seen some code which suggests the new firmware will work correctly and fix the bug. Deploying it to the installed user base is another matter though.”

A spokesperson for the National Crime Agency, which runs the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), added: “Parents, carers and young people should be vigilant about the digital trail of information left behind when buying or selling a refurbished or second-hand device.

“As demonstrated in this example, it may still be very difficult to be sure that information is secure despite taking these precautions, as such it is also advisable to change passwords on social media profiles, accounts, games and apps.”

There are a number of steps concerned parents can take to ensure data is properly wiped. Here are Munro’s top tips:",,2023-10-20 11:09:50.543174+00:00,True,True,False,,,Why it's a bad idea to sell your child's cheap tablet on eBay - The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The agents from the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service showed up on Muneeb Akhter’s Springfield doorstep in mid-July, he said, soon after they learned that he claimed to have created a hack so powerful it was like printing virtual money. Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning. ArrowRight The cybersecurity expert and self-described hacker, who started college at 16, had casually told co-workers soon after starting work as a DHS contractor that he could add money to major retailers’ gift cards without spending a dime.

Now, as the 22-year-old and the agents sat around his family’s dining room table, the officials wanted to know how. Akhter thought they might arrest him as he explained the hack, but instead, he said, they extended an extraordinary offer: Work secretly as a hacker for the government.

“There is no university we can go to and just recruit people,” a man, who Akhter said is a DHS agent, is heard saying on an audio recording of the meeting that Akhter’s family made. “The people we’re looking for might be the people they have concerns about because you have special skills that we need.”

The would-be offer intrigued Akhter, who had first heard about the potential job the day he revealed his hack to DHS colleagues. But it also roused his suspicions: Were the agents recruiting him or simply creating a ruse to get him to turn over evidence that authorities could use to prosecute him?

The account of the case is drawn from interviews with Akhter and his family, an audio recording of that July meeting with agents and a search warrant filed in Fairfax County Circuit Court. Such warrants often are precursors to criminal charges.

A DHS spokesman said he would not comment on the investigation, so the meeting at Akhter’s home and the recording could not be independently verified. Two of Akhter’s relatives who were present confirmed his account.

For now, the case is one of classic D.C. intrigue: What were Akhter’s intentions in supposedly creating the code? Does it exist? And even more fundamental in a region full of federal workers: Would an agency really recruit this way?

Akhter admits to stepping over the line. He said in a signed, sworn statement given to authorities that he used one of his hacked gift cards to make purchases at a Dunkin’ Donuts and helped friends load gift cards that they used to purchase airline frequent-flier miles. He now denies the latter admission.

He also has dabbled with other “black hat” hacks, such as code that allowed him to win Web auctions with low-ball bids.

Still, he said his intentions in this case were motivated by curiosity, not criminality. He said he was exploring a major security vulnerability that could cost some of the nation’s largest retailers, from Kmart to Starbucks.

Some experts say it is not so far-fetched to think Akhter was being considered for a job. They say that the growing threat of complex cyberattacks has given people with his skills new cachet and that federal agencies have had difficulty hiring and retaining such talent, in part because of the cultural conflict between stodgy federal bureaucracy and the freewheeling hacker underground.

Last year, Janet Napolitano — then the DHS director — said she was seeking to hire 600 ""hackers for good"" to fend off those with malicious intent.

Gabriella Coleman, a professor at McGill University in Montreal and the author of a forthcoming book about the hacking group Anonymous, put it simply: ""American and British governments are hungry to hire hackers.""

Akhter said his trouble began in late June, after he obtained a security clearance and a job as a cybersecurity contractor with DHS. Over lunch, he said, he told colleagues about the gift card hack. He also showed them some of the cards.

Akhter said those workers alerted his company, General Dynamics, which told DHS. When Akhter showed up for work the next day, he said his security badge was confiscated and he was ushered into a small room.

He said a DHS agent asked him to explain the hack and, afterward, a second DHS agent told him he was going to verify its feasibility with his cybersecurity team.

When the agent returned, Akhter said, they dangled the offer for the first time. They were considering him for a position with a classified hacking unit. He was told he would make $155,700 a year and be stationed in Seattle.

There was one catch: Akhter said he was required to sign a statement saying he had created the hack and to show agents that he could actually do it.

Akhter was interested. They set up the meeting at his house. And he swore out the statement, which is included in the search warrant.

In the statement, Akhter said he loaded at least $495 onto a Kmart gift card, $480 onto a Whole Foods card, $700 onto a Shell gas card, $180 onto a Dunkin’ Donuts card and $100 onto a Starbucks card.

Akhter used the Dunkin’ Donuts card himself and helped acquaintances load gift cards that they used to purchase frequent-flier miles with US Airways and American Airlines, according to the statement. The statement does not say whether the other cards were used.

In an interview, Akhter said he used the one card to confirm that his hack worked. He now says he has never loaded cards for others and that law enforcement officials miswrote what he told them. He said he simply showed the code to friends.

“I just did it to see if it would work or not,” Akhter said. “I’m a researcher. I’m not using [the code] maliciously.” He said he planned to take his concerns to the retailers and see if they would hire him to fix the problem, but that he hadn’t yet taken that step.

If the hack is legitimate, it would be in keeping with early talent Akhter showed in computing. He was born in Maryland but in the mid-1990s moved to Saudi Arabia, where his father is an engineer. He attended a private high school there before returning to the United States for college.

Akhter and his twin brother, Sohaib, enrolled at George Mason University before they had their driver’s licenses. During their time there, they built a robot with a teleconferencing system that allowed them to communicate with friends. They outfitted it with speakers that blasted music and dubbed it the “partybot.”

The brothers were George Mason’s youngest graduates in 2011, and Muneeb completed his master’s in computer engineering at the school by the time he turned 20. While Muneeb was getting the advanced degree, the brothers received a $200,000 grant from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, or DARPA, in 2012. The program gave hackers seed money to try to solve cyberdefense problems.

The Akhters’ project involved creating a device that would assess a computer’s vulnerability to “side channel attacks.”

Skilled users can observe a device’s power, electromagnetic radiation, timing and even sounds to determine what encryption software it is running and then crack it, not unlike a safecracker listening to lock clicks with a stethoscope in a caper movie.

“These two guys were super smart,” said Dan Farmer, who also received a DARPA grant and is a pioneering cybersecurity expert.

Akhter said he discovered the gift card hack while researching a topic equally as esoteric as side channel attacks. It employs a technique called “bit squatting.”

Computers encode Internet addresses as 0s and 1s, but very rarely heat, hardware issues or even cosmic rays will randomly cause a digit to flip and a Web user will be sent to the wrong site — for instance, Micro2oft.com instead of Microsoft.com.

A hacker could register the faulty Web address and use it to exploit an unlucky Web user through malware or other attacks.

Cybersecurity researcher Artem Dinaburg first warned of hackers doing this in 2011, but he said that until now it had remained a hypothesis. ""This would be the first documented attack that I'm aware of using bit squatting,"" Dinaburg said.

Dinaburg is skeptical about Akhter’s claims, but Farmer thought such a hack was theoretically possible. For now, the truth lies on Akhter’s hard drive, which was seized by the DHS agents. Presumably, authorities are looking for the code to create the gift card hack.

***

Some experts said it was unlikely that DHS would hire anyone in this manner, but the need for hacking skills might make Akhter an appealing target.

Coleman, the McGill professor, noted that the former head of the National Security Agency has spoken at hacker conventions, and recently the FBI director floated the idea of relaxing the agency’s strict drug policy in order to hire more hackers. Coleman said British intelligence has created online puzzles to draw in more renegade technologists.

Coleman said there is another possibility: DHS is trying to turn Akhter into an informant.

Federal law enforcement officials have used some high-profile hackers who have run afoul of the law to infiltrate hacker networks. One of the key members of a hacking group called Lulzsec helped lead investigators to other members of his group. The hacker behind one of the largest cases of identity theft in U.S. history helped authorities orchestrate a sophisticated sting on credit card thieves called ""Operation Firewall.""

Akhter said that because of the hack he was fired by General Dynamics for unacceptable workplace conduct. When the federal agents visited his home, he said, the job they offered had changed somewhat from the original description. He said the agents wanted him to hack and work as an informant. That made him more skeptical about the supposed job.

On the audiotape, one of the men he identified as an agent tells him: “We have good toys the private sector doesn’t have.” And then later: “I want you to work with us.”

Akhter now believes the job offer probably was a trick.

“I’m surprised at how the intelligence community actually works,” Akhter said. “I expected them to see my skill set and think, ‘This guy could be used for a lot of things.’ Instead, I’m going to being charged with something.”",,2023-10-20 11:17:58.384001+00:00,True,False,,,,A Virginia hacker catches the attention of federal law enforcement - The Washington Post,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brian Fox drove  from Boston to Santa Barbara, with two tapes stashed in his trunk. These weren't music tapes or video tapes. They were computer tapes---two massive reels loaded with software code and data, the sort you can see spinning on furniture-sized computers in classic movies like  Dr. Strangelove  and  Three Days of the Condor . The year was 1987, and as Fox drove cross-country to his new home, the tapes held a software program called Bash, a tool that Fox had built for the UNIX operating system and tagged with a license that let anyone use the code and even redistribute it to others. Fox---a high school dropout who spent his time hanging out with MIT computer geeks such as Richard Stallman---was a foot soldier in an ambitious effort to create software that was free, hackable, and unencumbered by onerous copy restrictions. It was called the Free Software Movement, and the idea was to gradually rebuild all of the components of the UNIX operating system into a free product called GNU and share them with the world at large. It was the dawn of open source software. Brian Fox. 
 Wikipedia CC 3.0 Fox and Stallman didn't know it at the time, but they were building the tools that would become some of the most important pieces of our global communications infrastructure for decades to come. After Fox drove those tapes to California and went back to work on Bash, other engineers started using the software and even helped build it. And as UNIX gave rise to GNU and Linux---the OS that drives so much of the modern internet---Bash found its way onto tens of thousands of machines. But somewhere along the way, in about 1992, one engineer typed a bug into the code. Last week, more then twenty years later, security researchers finally noticed this flaw in Fox's ancient program. They called it Shellshock, and they warned it could allow hackers to wreak havoc on the modern internet. Shellshock is one of the oldest known and unpatched bugs in the history of computing. But its story isn't that unusual. Earlier this year, researchers discovered another massive internet bug, called Heartbleed, that had also languished in open source software for years. Both bugs are indicative of a problem that could continue to plague the internet unless we revamp the way we write and audit software. Because the net is built on software that gets endlessly used and reused, it's littered with code that dates back decades, and some of it never gets audited for security bugs. When Bash was built, no one thought to audit it for internet attacks because that didn't really make sense. ""Worrying about this being one of the most [used] pieces of software on the planet and then having malicious people attack it was just not a possibility,"" Fox says. ""By the time it became a possibility, it had been in use for 15 years."" Today, it's used by Google and Facebook and every other big name on the internet, and because the code is open source, any of them can audit it at any time. In fact, anyone on earth can audit it at anytime. But no one thought to. And that needs to change. How the Web Was Built In digital terms, Fox's Bash program was about the same size as, say, a photograph snapped with your iPhone. But back in 1987, he couldn't email it across the country. The internet was only just getting off the ground. There was no world wide web, and the most efficient way to move that much data across the country was to put it in the trunk of a car. More on Shellshock: Hackers Are Already Using the Shellshock Bug to Launch Botnet Attacks The Internet Braces for the Crazy Shellshock Worm Bash is a shell utility, a black-boxy way of interfacing with an operating system that predates the graphical user interface. If you've used Microsoft's Windows command prompt, you get the idea. That may seem like an archaic thing, but as the internet took off, fueled by web browsers and the Apache web server, the Bash shell became a simple yet powerful way for engineers to glue web software to the operating system. Want your web server to get information from the computer's files? Make it pop up a bash shell and run a series of commands. That's how the web was built---script by script. Today, Bash is still an important part of the toolkit that helps power the web. It's on the Mac, and virtually any company that runs the Linux operating system, the descendant of UNIX, uses it as a quick and easy way to connect computer programs---web server software, for example---with the underlying operating system. But the lead developer of the program doesn't work for any of these big names. He doesn't even work for a tech company. His name is Chet Ramey, and he's a coder at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. He works on Bash in his spare time. 'Quite a Long Time' In the late 1980s, Ramey took over from Brian Fox as the lead developer of Bash, and this September 12, he received an email from a security researcher named Stephane Chazelas that identified the Shellshock bug. It was a serious security vulnerability that the world learned about last week. Within hours, hackers had released code that could take over vulnerable machines and  turn them into a malicious botnet. Chet Ramey in an undated family photo. 
 Chet Ramey Ramey doesn't have access to the project's source code revision logs dating back to the early '90s, but he thinks that he probably wrote the buggy code himself, sometime around 1992. That would make it the oldest, significant-yet-unpatched bug what we've heard of here at WIRED. We checked with someone who would know---Purdue University Professor Eugene Spafford---and he couldn't top it. ""I can't recall any others that were [unpatched] quite as long as this,"" he says. ""There are undoubtedly a number that have been out there longer, but the combination of age and potential impact would not be as large."" But it's a situation that feels eerily familiar to people familiar with Heartbleed, which was discovered in an widely used open-source project called OpenSSL. 1  Like the OpenSSL software, Bash has never had a full-blown security audit, and it's developed by a skeleton crew with virtually no financial support. That, unfortunately, is the story of the internet. The Lie of 'Many Eyes' For Robert Graham, the CEO of consultancy Errata Security, Shellshock gives lie to a major tenet of open-source software: that open-source code permits ""many eyes"" to view and then fix bugs more quickly than proprietary software, where the code is kept out of view from most of the world. It's an idea known as  Linus's Law . ""If many eyes had been looking at bash over the past 25 years, these bugs would've been found a long time ago,"" Graham  wrote on his blog last week. Linus Torvalds---the guy that Linus's Law is named after and the guy who created the Linux operating system---says that the idea still stands. But the fallacy is the idea that all open-source projects have many eyes. ""[T]here's a lot of code that doesn't actually get very many eyes at all,"" he says. ""And a lot of open-source projects don't actually have all that many developers involved, even when they are fairly core."" This kind of issue comes up with any software code---whether it's open source or not. After all, it's even harder to tell how many bugs like this may lurk in closed-source software such as Oracle's database. About a decade ago, Microsoft faced serious security problem because parts of its software weren't properly audited. But after the Blaster worm tore though systems running Microsoft's Windows operating system in 2003, the company made security audits a priority. Over the course of the next decade, it improved the standards of its code. Microsoft spent millions on security audits and it hired white-hat hackers, called pen testers, to test out its software. Now, the open source community is starting to do the same thing. This May, not long after the public first learned about the Heartbleed vulnerability, the Linux Foundation amassed a $6 million war chest to shore up the security on a few widely used open source projects, including OpenSSL, OpenSSH, and the Network Time Protocol. But Bash wasn't on the list. ""This was not predicted,"" says Jim Zemlin, the Foundation's executive director. ""But certainly, my guys are reaching out to those folks to see how we can help as we speak."" That's all well and good. But the trick is to shore up the internet before the bugs are found. Hopefully, the Linux Foundation---and the Googles and the Facebooks---can do so. Even with Shellshock, Brian Fox is still proud of the project he once drove across the country. ""It's been 27 years of that software being out there before a bug was found,"" he says. ""That's a pretty impressive ratio of usage to bugs found."" 1 Correction: 13:10 EDT 09/29/14 An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified OpenSSH as the source of the Heartbleed bug. The name of the project is OpenSSL.",,2023-10-20 11:19:17.103168+00:00,True,True,False,,,"The Internet Is Broken, and Shellshock Is Just the Start of Our Woes - WIRED",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRESTED BUTTE, Colo. -- We still don't have hoverboards or flying cars, but in the glorious future we live in today, we do have flying robots that can bring us beer. Unfortunately for those in the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration won't yet allow drones for commercial use. That means that while it's OK to fly beers around to your buddies in your spare time, no paid or promotional delivery services are allowed just yet.

Beer drones ride again! Eric Mack/CNET

But that hasn't stopped brew titan Anheuser-Busch InBev from looking into how drones might be able to help keep the party going in the near future. The company brought some experimental prototypes to Whatever, USA -- a fictional town that Bud Light created in Colorado last weekend for the purposes of throwing a party for 1,000 contest winners and creating all kind of new promotional content -- where I got an in-person demonstration.

I spoke with Federico Treu and Roberto Navoni of an outfit based in California and Italy called XTrace about the Bud Light delivery system that they worked up for ""Whatever."" Essentially, it's a custom-built quadcopter that's a slave to a beacon that also functions as a very simple remote control. Push one button, and the drone comes to you; a different button and it returns to where it started. Push a third button and the drone will follow you at a safe distance.

The small, lightweight drone can only carry one bottle of beer at a time, but it's still an important proof of concept for lazy beer drinkers everywhere. The drone can easily function as a push-button bartender or a beer-caddy, following you down the street with refreshment just hovering a few feet away, just in case you need a drink (the fourth and last button on the remote tells the drone to land where it is).

""When we started this project, the idea was that, it's really difficult to fly drones,"" Treu told me outside the Crested Butte ""Whatever"" Visitors' Center. ""But drones nowadays are smart enough to follow you, so even people that have never tried can fly a drone -- just hold the beacon, press the button and go.""

For drone nerds, there are also some interesting things going on behind the scenes of what seems like a simple remote-controlled drone setup. For the prototypes in use at ""Whatever,"" Navoni is in charge of safety. He walks around wearing Google Glass running a custom-made Glass app that provides him with a view of what the drone is seeing, as well as all the relevant statuses for the drones current operation.

In other words, while it may seem almost like a simple toy, Navoni is able to monitor everything that's happening with the drone through Glass and take over control of the drone if need be.

Treu says the next challenge for their drones is to automate obstacle avoidance. He says the drone in use at ""Whatever"" only has a carrying capacity of about 1 pound, but other form factors could easily handle bigger loads.

The drones came to ""Whatever, USA"" as part of a partnership through the ""beer garage,"" a sort of skunkworks lab run out of San Francisco that looks at use digital tools and other innovations to promote brands like Bud Light.

An investigation has been launched by Saudi Arabia's religious police after a British businessman was reportedly attacked by some of its members for using a women-only cash till at a supermarket.

Video footage has emerged which appears to show Peter Howarth-Lees as he is jumped on by a member of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, also known as the Mutawa, outside the supermarket in Riyadh.

In the video, after a woman appears to intervene, Mr Howarth-Lees, can be heard shouting 'That's my wife, how dare you.'

Video footage has emerged which appears to show Peter Howarth-Lees as he is jumped on by a member of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice outside the supermarket

An investigation has now been ordered by the head of the Mutawa into the incident, it has been reported.

Mr Howarth-Lees, who is married to a woman from Saudi Arabia, was attacked after members of the Mutawa followed him out of the shop, The Telegraph has reported.

A statement apparently written by Mr Howarth-Lees and posted on to a local website describes how he and his wife were directed to the female cashier before three men approached them and objected.

He said the couple were harassed by the men, despite the cashier's assertion that the customers were a family, before the argument spilled out into the car park after they had paid for their goods.

He said he was thrown to the ground when he tried to take a picture of the Mutawa members as evidence for a complaint after noticing one of them taking pictures of his car.

He said: 'While I was on the ground all three of them proceeded to kick me repeatedly in the head and back and then one of them stamped hard on my face.'



Mr Howarth-Lees said he was thrown to the ground when he tried to take a picture of the Mutawa members as evidence for a complaint after noticing one of them taking pictures of his car

His wife then got out of the car before one of the men, apparently as seen in the video, climbed on to a car and jumped on to Mr Howarth-Lees.

The incident finally came to an end after the couple were driven away in a British Embassy car.

Mr Howarth-Lees has told The Telegraph that the head of the Mutawa had told him an investigation had been ordered.

The Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice is the Saudi Arabian government's religious police to enforce Sharia Law within the Islamic nation.

Altogether, it has 3,500 to 4,000 police officers who enforce a strict religious code among citizens.

The incident took place outside a supermarket in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia (file picture)

Members patrol the streets checking dress code, strict separation of men and women, salat prayer by Muslims during prayer times, and other behaviour it believes to be commanded by Islam.

The Mutawa are known for having full beards and wearing their headscarves (ghutrah or shemagh) loose without an agal and often come from Saudi Arabia's lower classes.

The body has widespread powers to detain and berate offenders and shut down businesses and are employed directly by the King. The organisation's 2013 budget was the equivalent of $390million.

In May this year it was reported that five Saudi men had been sentenced to 32 years in prison and 4,500 lashes by a criminal court in Saudi Arabia for holding a Valentine's Day party.

The men were caught at a rented rest house in the Al-Farouq area of Buraidah Qassim province and accused of holding a party with women who were unrelated to them, drinking and dancing.",,2023-10-20 11:42:19.347909+00:00,True,False,,,,British man and Saudi wife attacked at Riyadh supermarket for using women-only till - Daily Mail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact, numerous third-party apps like SaveSnap, SnapBox and SnapSpy offer users the ability to save incoming photos.

Their mere existence undermines Snapchat's purpose. And if these third-party apps are unsafe, Snapchat is too. An Internet storm brewing Friday offered a prime example.

One of those third-party services was supposedly hacked, according to Business Insider. Misfits on the image-sharing website 4chan.org claim they hacked into a third-party app and stole 100,000 photos and videos.

This collection, which might be published this weekend, is likely to include child pornography. Snapchat is popular as a tool for sending nude images. And half of its users are teenagers between the ages of 13 and 17.

""Everyone who sends a message using Snapchat's service could be at risk,"" said Patrick Wardle, research director at security firm Synack.

Snapchat is adamant that its servers were not hacked. But that doesn't matter, because there's a hole in their entire system.

Computer security experts already reject the Snapchat platform. Critics have previously noted that anyone can take a screenshot of an incoming photo -- or use a separate camera to take a picture of the screen.

But the hack of third-party apps reveals another flaw in Snapchat's platform -- and questions the company's commitment to security, according to computer security researcher Jonathan Zdziarski.

One, Snapchat isn't doing enough to protect its software. That's why third-party apps can essentially hack its platform. Two, Snapchat hasn't succeeded in convincing Apple and Google to keep what are essentially ""Snapchat hacks"" out of their app stores.

Neither Apple (AAPL) nor Google (GOOG) responded to questions about the matter.

Snapchat did not explain why others are so easily able to reverse engineer the company's software and thwart its privacy features.

Chris Wysopal, cofounder of security firm Veracode, said Snapchat should try to ban these third-party apps.

This is the kind of revelation that could question Snapchat's $10 billion valuation. (On a related note, the company turned down a $3 billion buyout offer from Facebook.)

This episode also drew criticism from Snapchat competitor Wickr, an app that offers self-destructing, encrypted messages.

Wickr CEO Nico Sell noted that if Snapchat sent encrypted messages -- that only get decrypted by the Snapchat app -- it could have blocked third-party apps and avoided this entire fiasco.

""They don't take security seriously,"" Sell said. ""They could have fixed this with a technical solution. For them to say, 'Oh our servers weren't breached' is irresponsible.""

Consider this incident a reminder: Nude selfies aren't private once they leave your possession.

""The whole idea of expiring messages is laughable,"" Zdziarski said.

30767,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/24/driveclub-car-crash-sony-playstation,2014-10-24 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2014-10-24 00:00:00. Driveclub, Sony’s much hyped socially connected driving game and a key PlayStation 4 exclusive, has broken down. Three weeks after it rolled from the showroom and out on to consoles all over the world, the internet functionality is shot, the game’s servers seemingly unable to cope with the numbers of players trying to get online.

Developer Evolution Studios has been forced to hold off the release of the planned PlayStation Plus version as well as the companion app, and has repeatedly assured players that the team is working non-stop to solve the issues, preventing them from meeting and playing socially. Yet despite a couple of patches, as well as evidence of behind-the-scenes tinkering, the situation has only improved marginally.



At the time of writing the online portion of the game is still not functioning satisfactorily. After no server access for the first 10 days, semi consistent multiplayer races have finally been possible this week, but the process continues to be laborious (just seven races in one hour is our best performance to date) and connection success rate in our experience has only improved to around 50%. When it works, the racing is mostly solid but compromises are evident – there has been no change to the only two types of available racing all week, for instance.

Elsewhere, the Challenges element continues to be offline, as are the Face Off segments, player’s stats, ghosts, and the Notifications. Even the Leaderboards aren’t behaving properly.

On forums, Facebook, and Twitter, Driveclub players have been expressing their frustration. “So far, Driveclub is no ‘socially connected’ racing game, it’s barely connected at all!” wrote Christian Pohl on the Driveclub Facebook page. “Sorry, after three weeks of ‘We’re fixing it, we’re fixing it’ and no discernible improvements on my end, I’m about done, as fun as the actual driving model is.”

Trawl through the comments, filter out the Xbox fanboy vultures predictably feasting on this all-too-perfect ready meal, and you’re still left with hundreds of accounts of similarly disappointing experiences. “I had the game a day or so after launch and the online aspect was not working, you could not connect to the servers at all so this meant you could not join a club or play online,” Andy Hill told the Guardian. “Over the past two weeks it has never worked properly once.”

Locked down



In the little communication since the problems began – requests to Evolution or Sony for comment were politely rebuffed, with the developer effectively on lockdown. Evolution has stated that it had no indication of the impending trouble from tests it ran ahead of the game’s release.

Indeed, prior to the launch, there were few signs of impending issues. While reviewing the game, the Guardian experienced just four or five occasions when online connectivity was interrupted, with the disruption momentary in all cases – and this was in fact expected as Evolution had communicated it would be playing with the servers while readying the game for release. Besides, so few blips during more than 14 hours of play seemed no cause for alarm, especially with hundreds of players already online.

The key issue is that, unlike a game that simply features a subsidiary multiplayer mode, the online connectivity in Driveclub is utterly central to the overall experience. Even in singleplayer, the ability to experience Face Off segments – the mini-challenges based on another player’s speed, powersliding, or cornering line through a particular section – contribute greatly to the vitality of the play experience. There are still thrilling moments to be had in offline singleplayer, but overall the game is comparatively lifeless when cut off from the internet.

When you consider the broader scope, the impact is stronger still. The challenges that clubs and individuals can issue each other, for instance, serve as the engine that keeps the momentum of player engagement going. Without them, Driveclub loses much of its drive.

Hill agrees. “On one occasion I was doing a time trial and the gods aligned and I had other people’s ghosts to race, in-game challenges to do and it made such a difference to the game; it really highlighted what an empty experience it is without all of these – 99% of the time unfortunately.”

The trouble with servers



There have been other high-profile online-related launch failures, of course, but this has only added to the bafflement some players have felt over Driveclub’s situation. “Sim City and Battlefield 4 had disastrous launches, and a year before that, Diablo III,” wrote Pohl. “By now, the established formula for server capacity at launch day should be ‘Whatever you’ve planned, double it and add 20% extra, just to be sure’.”

Of course, it’s not really that simple – most developers insist that it’s impossible to fully stress test a server network before a game’s full release. You can throw millions of test bots at the system, but in a real-world launch scenario, with hundreds of different stages in the delivery platform, often including rented server space outside of the direct control of the dev team, there will always be unforeseen bottlenecks and errors. Evolution has stated that it did run “large scale synthetic load tests” and that they worked well. “We had confidence everything was ready,” wrote the game’s director Paul Rustchynsky on Twitter. “These issues were unexpected.”

Vitally, there is so much riding on Driveclub’s success. Not only is it the PS4’s first focused driving title, in most respects it has been portrayed as the poster child for the console’s connectivity message. For it to have crashed so spectacularly is a worst-case scenario for Evolution and, particularly, for Sony.

Faulty goods?



But where does this leave disappointed consumers? Can they get a refund on a game when the online components aren’t working? Unfortunately the situation is ambiguous because consumer law hasn’t kept up with the evolution of video game features or with digital distribution practices.



“The Sale of Goods Act should apply,” says Alex Tutty at entertainment law specialist Sheridans. “This includes provisions that the good is as described and of satisfactory quality. The multiplayer functionality in Drive Club is arguably one of its core components and so as it is not working correctly may be considered a breach of the Act. If that’s the case the player can choose to reject it – in a reasonable time – and return it and obtain a refund.”

However, consumer protection law is made more complicated by software products which contain elements that can be patched at a later date. “If a game does not work as expected but the publisher is then able to remedy that, is there a claim?” says Jas Purewal, an interactive entertainment lawyer at Purewal & Partners. “If the game does not have certain functionality at launch due to factors outside the publisher’s control, is there a claim? If the game does have everything the publisher promised but sheer demand means the online functionality can’t work fully, is there a claim?

“We just don’t know the definitive answers to these questions yet. There are consumer protection rules which could be used, but they were not really designed with these issues in mind and, in any event, every case depends on its facts and circumstances [...] The court or regulator needs to strike a fair balancing act between the two sides.”

Driveclub itself will most likely eventually bounce back on to the track fully formed and regain a lot of the momentum it has lost – the experience, when firing on all cylinders, is exhilarating. However, the dent in Sony and Evolution Studios’ reputation will take a lot longer to buff out.

The failure happened three weeks after the game's release, when the game's servers were unable to handle the number of players trying to get online. The online functionality of the game was completely shot, preventing players from meeting and playing socially. The failure impacted the online portion of the game, including multiplayer races, Challenges, Face Off segments, player's stats, ghosts, and notifications. The failure also affected the Leaderboards. The developer, Evolution Studios, had to hold off the release of the planned PlayStation Plus version and the companion app. The cause of the failure was the inability of the game's servers to cope with the high number of players. The impact of the failure was that players were unable to fully experience the game's online features, which were central to the overall experience. The responsible entity for the failure was Evolution Studios, the developer of the game. The impacted entities were the players who purchased and played the game. The failure caused frustration among players, who expressed their disappointment on forums, Facebook, and Twitter. The failure also had a negative impact on the reputation of both Evolution Studios and Sony, as Driveclub was seen as a key game for the PlayStation 4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[-0.020274922251701355, -0.015137738548219204, 0.02120065689086914, -0.02881516143679619, -0.03144894540309906, 0.0005798073252663016, -0.006411699578166008,

With Apple's launch of its 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, it's clear that big phones are here to stay. This isn't news to Huawei, however, which already has a range of palm-stretching mobiles to tempt you with.

The Good The Huawei Ascend Mate 7 packs a huge battery that keeps going for ages, its screen is bright and bold, the camera is pretty decent and the fingerprint sensor actually works. The Bad It's running on an old version of Android, Huawei's software tweaks make it clunky to use and there's loads of bloatware installed as standard. The Bottom Line Although it's let down by its awkward software, the excellent battery life and big, bright screen help make the Huawei Ascend Mate 7 a decent choice for those of you looking for movies and games on the go.

The latest addition is called the Mate 7. It's not the seventh generation, nor does it have a 7-inch display, so I'm baffled as to the name. It actually has a 6-inch display with a full HD resolution, an octa-core processor, 4G LTE, a fingerprint scanner and a 13-megapixel camera.

The Ascend Mate 7 is due to go on sale later in October, although precise pricing or regional availability isn't yet known. With such an imposing lineup of specs, it's unlikely to go for pocket change, although Huawei has promised that it'll be very competitively priced. Keep your eyes on CNET over the coming weeks for further pricing and availability of this giant phone.

Design and display

Let's not beat around the bush here, the Mate 7 is huge. It has a 6-inch screen which has required the body to balloon out to 157mm (6.2 inches) long and 81mm (3.2 inches) wide. It's nigh on impossible to use with only one hand, unless you have palms the size of planets. One of the big ones. Jupiter, maybe.

It could be worse, though. By using an extremely narrow bezel around the display, the all-metal body, while big, is all being put to use -- there's no wasted space by simply having chunky bezels around the screen. Indeed, Huawei boasts that 83 percent of the face of the phone is screen.

As well as silver, the phone will be available in a dark grey colour as well as a light gold -- three colours I'm sure Huawei chose by complete accident, forgetting the iPhone 5S launched in exactly the same hues. iPhone aside, it's actually rather reminiscent of the HTC One Max , thanks partly to its size, but also the matte metal, the curved back, the lines crossing the back at the top and bottom, the camera and flash placement and of course the fingerprint scanner sitting directly below the camera. So not that similar really.

It feels pretty good to hold -- certainly much nicer than Huawei's slew of plasticky budget phones -- and the metal and narrow bezel help it look like a reasonably high end device. It's not the most interesting of designs though. You'll find a microSD card slot on the side (you'll need a SIM removal tool to access it) which you'll want to use to expand the 16GB of built-in storage.

Fingerprint sensor

The fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone is positioned precisely where your index finger will naturally rest when you pick the phone up. It's certainly comfortable to use, although it does mean you need to pick your phone up to unlock it, rather than jab at the screen when it's lying on your desk.

The sensor is very accurate, however, and can recognise your finger when placed in any direction. It rarely failed to recognise my own finger -- something I certainly can't say about the Galaxy S5 's scanner, which I found to fail more often than not, rendering it a little useless.

Holding your finger over the sensor will wake your phone from standby, too; you can use it to authenticate PayPal payments and you can even use it to take photos -- the position makes it very helpful for taking selfies.

Display

When Huawei initially told me about the phone ahead of its official unveiling, I was told that the phone would have a 2,560x1,600-pixel resolution, which would match the LG G3 's higher-than-full HD display. Huawei's had a change of heart since then, however, as the Mate 7 you'll find in the shops will have a lesser 1,920x1,080-pixel display.

That's a bit of a shame, as a screen that size would potentially benefit from the extra pixels in a way the G3 doesn't -- I couldn't see much benefit in its high resolution on a 5.5-inch screen. Still, the Mate has a pixel density of 367 pixels per inch, which is higher than that of the iPhone 6 and it does seem very crisp indeed. Icons have well-defined edges, high-resolution images look good and text is easy to read. I definitely don't think it's lacking in definition, but I'd like to see how a higher-definition panel looks on this phone, even just for curiosity's sake.

It's bright, almost painfully so at times and it has strong, vibrant colours that stop just short of looking unnatural. Viewing angles are excellent, too. Its overall high quality, coupled with its vast size makes it a great choice for the Netflix addicts among you.

Android software and Huawei additions

The Mate 7 arrives with Android 4.4.2 KitKat onboard, which is disappointing as that's a couple of versions out of date (version 4.4.4 is the most up to date version of Android around). I'm happy to forgive older software on budget mobiles, but on pricier, higher-end kit, it's far less excusable.

Huawei has changed the Android interface so much, however, that you probably won't immediately notice that you're on old software. It's visually very different from regular Android, mainly due to the fact that there's no app tray. Instead, all your apps and widgets are held across the multiple home screens.

I'm not keen on this personally as it's extremely difficult to keep any kind of order -- particularly if you enjoy using a lot of widgets, which will leave you having to swipe through many screens before finding that one app you need. Apple's iOS also doesn't have an app tray though so if you're moving over from an iPhone it might be more to your taste.

You can apply various themes to the phone, which change everything from the colour scheme and background images to the app icons themselves. It's nice being able to put your own stamp on things, but there's only six themes installed -- none of which I particularly like -- and for the life of me, I couldn't find an official Huawei store where you can find more themes to download. After googling, I found some forums where people had posted some, but installing software from unknown sources like this is potentially very risky and I really wouldn't recommend it.

Some of the tweaks are quite welcome, though. You can customise the order of the navigation buttons at the bottom of the phone as well as add a shortcut button that pulls down the notification bar for you -- something that can be tricky to with one hand on such a massive phone. The Phone Manager tool lets you quickly clear out unwanted files, kill background processes and even set up a ""Harassment Filter"", which can block calls from set numbers or from unknown callers -- a tool I'm quite keen on.

The phone is also let down by a vast amount of pre-installed software. You'll find games like Bubble Bash Mania, Dragon Mania and Real Football 2015 already on the phone, as well as software like Todoist and Bitcasa. Finding so much stuff onboard the first time you even turn it on is far from ideal. It makes the interface seem immediately cluttered and messy and makes it more difficult for new users to understand. ""What's this? Do I need this?"" are questions you should expect to hear if a non-techy relative gets a Mate 7.

Processor and battery performance

The Mate 7 has an octa-core processor, made up of two quad-core units. One, slightly less powerful, is used for basic tasks, while the phone switches to the more potent side of the silicon when it needs more power for stuff like gaming or image processing. The switchover is seamless -- you won't be alerted when it goes into the high-powered mode.

It's a very powerful processor. It scored 4,468 on the Geekbench benchmark test, putting it above the extremely capable Samsung Galaxy Alpha (4,350). On the Quadrant test, however, the Mate 7 only managed a score of 11,401 -- less than half the score the Samsung Galaxy S5 achieved (23,707). Benchmarks aren't always a reliable measure of performance though, and the vast difference between those tests shows that something else is at play here.

In general use, I found the phone's performance was decent. Gaming was handled well -- Dead Trigger 2, Asphalt 8 and N.O.V.A 3 all played smoothly -- while photo editing in Snapseed and Adobe Photoshop Express was a breeze. High-definition video playback and streaming was great and the interface is generally responsive, with apps and the camera quick to open.

That massive body has made room for a capacious 4,000mAh battery, which performed extremely well on my tests. From a full charge, it lasted 17 hours on our video looping test, making it one of the best performers we've seen. By comparison, the iPhone 6 lasted just over 10 hours on the same test, while the Galaxy S5 achieved 15 hours.

Your own times will vary considerably, of course. If you keep that bright screen on throughout most of the day, then you'll see the power ebb away fairly quickly. It holds its charge extremely well in standby -- I left it in standby for nearly a fortnight and found it still had power remaining -- so if you're careful about what you do, you could probably get a couple of days use out of it.

Camera

The Mate 7 has a 13-megapixel camera stuck to its back that's capable of taking some great shots.

My first shot of this scooter in Berlin looks great, with good colours, an even exposure and plenty of detail at full screen.

The colours are lovely too on this shot of sweet chestnuts hanging from a tree. Again, there's loads of detail at full screen.

Colours are far less impressive on this landscape scene; in fact I'd go so far as to say it's very drab. On the upside, it has a very even exposure, which isn't easy when there's such a bright sky to compensate for.

There's an HDR mode as well, which has helped bring up some of the shadows on this building, as well as tone down some of the brightness in the sky. It's dulled some of the colours however, particularly in the blue sky, so I'd want to give this shot a saturation boost in Snapseed before posting it online.

Conclusion

The Huawei Ascend Mate 7 has much to brag about. Its vast screen is sharp, bright and bold, making it brilliant for movies on the go, while its octa-core processor provides oodles of power. The real cherry on top, however, is the capacious battery, which will easily last a day, if not quite a bit longer.

Its size certainly won't appeal to everyone though, and Huawei's software is still mostly a confusing mess that needs to be removed. Even so, the Mate 7 has plenty going for it and if it ends up with a reasonable price tag attached too, it'll definitely be worth a look.",,2023-10-20 14:17:35.583864+00:00,True,False,,,,Huawei Ascend Mate 7 review: A huge metal phone with the battery life to match - CNET,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30975,https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/sketchy-snapchat-backup-services-leave-users-exposed/,2014-10-10 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnet.com,,"Published on None. Third-party services that let Snapchat users back up their photos and videos -- and that Snapchat claims it tried to shut down -- are at the center of the latest Snapchat hack.

An enormous, 13-gigabyte library of photos and videos from an estimated 200,000 accounts had been saved through apps and websites not affiliated with Snapchat has been hacked. Snapchat popularized ""ephemeral"" messaging services, which claim to delete messages after they are viewed.

A close read of Snapchat's privacy policy indicates that the service would not be in violation of any of its publicly-posted policies to keep messages long after users think they've been deleted. The policy states that ""there may be ways to access Snaps"" on your device even after the app has deleted them.

That appears to have been the case with the two third-party services that are suspected of being at the center of the hack, details of which were first reported by Business Insider on Friday. SnapSave, an Android app, and the similarly named SnapSaved, a website that closed down several months ago, allowed Snapchat users to read messages outside of Snapchat's app. They also appear to have created backups of messages.

It's not clear if the backups were created intentionally, or if the services were created with the express purpose of storing Snapchat messages without the knowledge or permission of Snapchat users.

Snapchat put the blame squarely on the shoulders of its users, and said, ""Snapchatters were victimized by their use of third-party apps to send and receive Snaps, a practice that we expressly prohibit in our Terms of Use precisely because they compromise our users' security. We vigilantly monitor the App Store and Google Play for illegal third-party apps and have succeeded in getting many of these removed.""

""What we do know is that our servers have not been breached and no Snaps have been leaked from our servers,"" Snapchat spokeswoman Mary Ritti told CNET.

The company did not answer questions about what steps it has taken to warn its users about these third-party services aside from its Terms of Service.

Chris Eng, vice president of research at computer-security research firm Veracode, said Snapchat has ""a history of not taking security seriously.""

""SnapSave was in the [Google Play Store] since 2013. That alone suggests to me that they're not being very aggressive"" about policing third-party apps, Eng said.

He added that Snapchat was slow to adopt encryption, a common tool to protect Internet traffic from snooping, and that Snapchat's initial implementation of encryption was weak because they used only a ""single encryption key.""

""I would bet that they've never had an independent security review,"" Eng said, referring to a common way for companies to evaluate how tough their security is.

Snapchat is best known for offering something Facebook and Twitter don't: A way to send messages without having to think about what they'll look like a few years from now. When customers send each other photo or video ""snaps,"" recipients can view them for a short amount of time before they disappear. Snapchat debuted in 2011.

The service has now become one of the titans of the social-networking industry, particularly attracting users aged 18 to 24. One estimate says that half of Snapchat users are teenagers between 13 and 17 years old.

Facebook reportedly attempted to buy the firm for $3 billion last year, in addition to fielding two apps of its own that attempt to offer similar functionality. In August, ComScore said the app had become the third-most popular social media app in the US, behind Facebook and its photo-sharing service Instagram.

The Snapchat-related breach comes a month after hackers cracked open Apple's iCloud service to steal celebrity photos, many of which depicted the celebrities in nude or sexual situations.

Actress Jennifer Lawrence spoke to Vanity Fair about the iCloud hack. ""It is not a scandal. It is a sex crime,"" she said, calling the hack a ""sexual violation"" and attacking the sites that host the photos as ""disgusting.""

Victims of the Snapchat hack are left with little recourse. While celebrities have used their star power to threaten Google with a lawsuit for linking to images stolen from iCloud, Snapchat users so far do not appear to be linked. Contacting the administrators of websites that are hosting the images may be the only way to get photos and videos from Snapchat removed, and there's no guarantee that will work.

Not all ephemeral messaging services are as open to third parties as Snapchat. Wickr, a similar service that not only can delete messages after they've been sent, but also encrypt them so that not even Wickr employees can see what users are sending to each other, prevents third-party services from accessing its servers.

Wickr's Android app is prevented from taking screenshots. But users can take screenshots in Wickr on an iPhone because Apple doesn't allow developers to disable screen-capturing in iOS.",,2023-10-20 14:23:07.068410+00:00,True,True,False,,,Sketchy Snapchat backup services leave users exposed - CNET,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can’t get a free Audi R8 car by liking a Facebook post. Which sounds like an obvious statement, but according to security firm Bitdefender, more than 200,000 users of the social network have fallen for a ‘Like-farming’ giveaway promising exactly that.

The company has reported a Facebook page to the social network that has been soliciting likes and shares for a competition supposedly ending on 20 November tha would reward two “lucky winners” with the R8 cars.

Entrants were asked to like the page and share its post on their own timelines, while saying what colour car they’d like if they won. Bitdefender claims that the page has attracted nearly 180,000 likes and more than 210,000 shares so far.

Some of its posts include links to videos, which is where the scam gets worrying: Bitdefender says that some of the sites hosting those videos are also running the JS:Trojan.JS.Likejack.A code that can be used for “clickjacking on hidden commercials”.

“Like-farming may not seem the worse things scammers can do on Facebook. However, it has repercussions for users and companies’ reputations and can even lead to identity theft,” said Bitdefender’s chief security strategist Catalin Cosoi in a statement.

“Like-farming Facebook pages use the high number of fans to launch other fraudulent activities such as malware and survey scams to a wide audience. The database of unwary users can also be sold on the black market and used for more targeted attacks.”

The Audi R8 scammers fit into a long line of such hoaxes on Facebook, including baits encouraging users to see “who viewed your profile”, as well as fraudulent giveaways and fake videos of celebrities and terrorist activities.

In 2014 alone, there have been high-profile scams including a link promising a video of a woman undressing on a webcam; a “Facebook colour changer” app that installed malicious software on user’s computers; and a tool offering to find out friends’ passwords that actually took control of the user’s account.",,2023-10-20 17:01:40.078461+00:00,True,False,,,,"No, you can't get free Audi R8 cars on Facebook – it's a scam - The Guardian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31603,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/17/steve-albini-at-face-the-music-how-the-internet-solved-problem-with-music,2014-11-16 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2014-11-17 00:00:00. Back in the 1990s, Steve Albini was the music industry’s resident and persistent cynic. At the time he was doing what he continues to do today: playing in bands (such as Shellac) and producing the music of other bands – although he prefers to call himself a recording engineer. In his mind, the word better captures the technical skill that all producers should, but often don’t, have. He has engineered more than 2,000 records – by bands you mostly won’t have heard of, although a few of them you will, including PJ Harvey, Joanna Newsom, Pixies, Fugazi and that little three-piece out of Seattle, Nirvana. In certain musical circles, he is nigh-on worshipped for his singularly independent spirit and approach to production.

On occasion Albini would write with eloquence and humour about the business of music and, more specifically, rail against its perceived inequalities. These were best summarised in his seminal essay, The Problem with Music, published in the Baffler in 1993. It memorably opened with the image of bands voluntarily swimming through a trench “filled with runny, decaying shit” in a race to reach a major label contract on the other side. Albini described them viciously fending off other competitors, only to get to the end and be told: “Actually, I think you need a little more development. Swim it again, please. Backstroke.”

Albini was 31 at the time and had considerable experience in the music world, as a musician, an engineer and perhaps most importantly as a consummate fan of, and evangelist for, talented musicians. His essay was not a broad anti-corporation rant – there’s no high-flying ideology – but highlighted specific gripes, illustrated by personal experiences. The industry, as it was then, was dominated by the big labels and the bloated middlemen who exploited the music of (generally) poorly paid musicians, resulting in a lack of choice for consumers.

More than 20 years later, it’s a vastly different place. As Albini said on Saturday in his keynote address at Melbourne’s Face the Music conference, he has consistently worked in music throughout the past two decades and is thus well-placed to speak about its changes. As someone who is now Albini’s age when he wrote The Problem with Music, I am accustomed to figures of his generation waxing lyrical about the past, too often declaring today’s scene nothing but the ashen heap of a once-glorious kingdom. Would the music industry’s biggest curmudgeon still have something to rail against?

As it turns out, no he doesn’t. That’s the thing about Albini – he was never rebelling for the sake of rebelling. Throughout the intervening years he has demonstrated moral consistency in the face of the digital revolution. Albini has always put the music first and in his mind the old paradigm, dominated as it was by labels, radio stations and a handful of mega-successful musicians, did not produce a healthy ecosystem. A wealth of talent not only failed to achieve sustainable careers, but were exploited by a multimillion-dollar industry, which flogged their music with virtually no financial risk to themselves and returned little in terms of royalties to the artists.

Back in 1993, Albini couldn’t have known – or at least gave no hint of knowing – that the internet would shake up the music world as it has. The fact that it has, providing solutions to the many challenges faced by both talent (how do we record and distribute music easily and cheaply?) and fans (how do we find and consume music easily and cheaply?) is to be celebrated.

Nor does he skirt around the issue of pay; his original essay famously included a financial breakdown of who gets paid what in the music industry. And if anything, Albini argues that for the vast majority of musicians the internet has provided comparable, if not superior, pay rates than the system of old.

We’ve published the entire address (with a few edits; I removed a throwaway jibe at Prince in case his highness’s lawyers come knocking) and it’s worth reading as a follow-up to his essay written 21 years ago. Albini explains in detail how major labels would carelessly spend money on promotion, thereby propping up record stores, radio stations and PR companies, safe in the knowledge that this money would be recouped at the artists’ expense.

It’s as if your boss, instead of giving your paycheck to you, could pay that money to his friends and associates Steve Albini

As he explains in his address: “It’s as if your boss, instead of giving your paycheck to you, could pay that money to his friends and business associates, invoking your name as he did. Since his net cost was the same and his friends and associates could return the favour, why would he ever want to let any of that money end up in your hands?”

In the eyes of Albini and his cohort of hard-working, indie bands – not to mention many musicians who had a brief (and largely financially unrewarding) time in the spotlight – the internet has offered a way of creating a sustainable career.

Albini has a knack for colourful imagery, such as this description of how the internet has provided music lovers instant access to a cornucopia from around the world: “Imagine a great hall of fetishes where whatever you felt like fucking or being fucked by, however often your tastes might change, no matter what hardware or harnesses were required, you could open the gates and have at it on a comfy mattress at any time of day. That’s what the internet has become for music fans. Plus bleacher seats for a cheering section.”

For every David Byrne or Taylor Swift critiquing the new pay model, there are acts such as Detroit’s Death who are experiencing a career renaissance, thanks to music obsessives who trawl through back catalogues and share them in a noisy, heaving, digital jungle. Or to provide an Australian context, young, new artists such as Courtney Barnett, who have the initiative to take advantage of this brave new world, selling music and T-shirts through Bandcamp and taking a higher per-piece profit as a result.

Albini has always been an outsider but today it’s his optimism that sets him apart. In the final third of his hour-long speech he dismantles a commonly uttered platitude: “We need to figure out how to make this digital distribution work for everyone.” Within this seemingly inoffensive statement are tacit assumptions, he explains, namely “the framework of an exploitative system that I have been at odds with my whole creative life”.

For Albini, the internet has placed us on a path to a democratic utopia which does not require the flailing, corrupt figures of a fading musical past. He leaves us with an even more radical idea in the area of copyright: that we should let go of all attempts to exert control over the distribution of works once they are released. He uses that word “release” in a literal sense – like “a bird or a fart”. As he says: “music has entered the environment as an atmospheric element, like the wind, and in that capacity should not be subject to control and compensation.”

In contrast to what almost anyone else will tell you, Albini believes there has never been a better time to be involved in music – as a fan and as a musician (excluding, perhaps, the megastars): “I see more bands and I hear more music than ever before in my life. There are more gigs, more songs available than ever before, bands are being treated with more respect, and are more in control of their careers and destinies.

“I see them continuing as a constellation of enterprises: some big, some small, most small but all of them with a more immediate response from their audience and a greater chance to succeed. It is genuinely exciting.”",,2023-10-20 17:01:42.746930+00:00,True,False,,,,Steve Albini: the internet has solved the problem with music - The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31766,https://www.wired.com/2014/11/darkhotel-malware/,2014-11-10 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.wired.com,,"Published on 2014-11-10 16:06:17+00:00.  The hotel guest  probably never knew what hit him. When he tried to get online using his five-star hotel's WiFi network, he got a pop-up alerting him to a new Adobe software update. When he clicked to accept the download, he got a malicious executable instead. What he didn't know was that the sophisticated attackers who targeted him had been lurking on the hotel's network for days waiting for him to check in. They uploaded their malware to the hotel's server days before his arrival, then deleted it from the hotel network days after he left. That's the conclusion reached by researchers at Kaspersky Lab and the third-party company that manages the WiFi network of the unidentified hotel where the guest stayed, located somewhere in Asia. __ Kaspersky says the attackers have been active for at least seven years, conducting surgical strikes against targeted guests at other luxury hotels in Asia as well as infecting victims via spear-phishing attacks and P2P networks.__ Kaspersky researchers named the group DarkHotel, but they're also known as Tapaoux by other security firms who have been separately tracking their spear-phishing and P2P attacks. The attackers have been active since at least 2007, using a combination of highly sophisticated methods and pedestrian techniques to ensnare victims, but the hotel hacks appear to be a new and daring development in a campaign aimed at high-value targets. ""Every day this is getting bigger and bigger,"" says Costin Raiu, manager of Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis Team. ""They're doing more and more hotels."" The majority of the hotels that are hit are in Asia but some are in the U.S. as well. Kaspersky will not name the hotels but says they've been uncooperative in assisting with the investigation. ""This Is NSA-Level Infection Mechanism"" The attackers' methods include the use of zero-day exploits to target executives in spear-phishing attacks as well as a kernel-mode keystroke logger to siphon data from victim machines. They also managed to crack weak digital signing keys to generate certificates for signing their malware, in order to make malicious files appear to be legitimate software. ""Obviously, we're not dealing with an average actor,"" says Raiu. ""This is a top-class threat actor. Their ability to do the kernel-mode key logger is rare, the reverse engineering of the certificate, the leveraging of zero days---that puts them in a special category."" >""Their targeting is nuclear themed, but they also target the defense industry base in the U.S."" Targets in the spear-phishing attacks include high-profile executives---among them a media executive from Asia---as well as government agencies and NGOs and U.S. executives. The primary targets, however, appear to be in North Korea, Japan, and India. ""All nuclear nations in Asia,"" Raiu notes. ""Their targeting is nuclear themed, but they also target the defense industry base in the U.S. and important executives from around the world in all sectors having to do with economic development and investments."" Recently there has been a spike in the attacks against the U.S. defense industry. The attackers seems to take a two-pronged approach---using the P2P campaign to infect as many victims as possible and then the spear-phishing and hotel attacks for surgically targeted attacks. In the P2P attacks thousands of victims are infected with botnet malware during the initial stage, but if the victim turns out to be interesting, the attackers go a step further to place a backdoor on the system to exfiltrate documents and data. Until recently, the attackers had about 200 command-and-control servers set up to manage the operation. Kaspersky managed to  sinkhole 26 of the command server domains  and even gained access to some of the servers, where they found unprotected logs identifying thousands of infected systems. A lot of the machines in the attackers' logs, however, turned out to be sandboxes set up by researchers to ensnare and study botnets, showing how indiscriminating the attackers were in their P2P campaign. The attackers shut down much of their command infrastructure in October, however, presumably after becoming aware that the Kaspersky researchers were tracking them ""As far as I can see there was an emergency shut down,"" Raiu says. ""I think there is a lot of panic over this."" Signs Point to South Korea That panic may be because the campaign shows signs of possibly emanating from an important U.S. ally: South Korea. Researchers point out that one variant of malware the attackers used was designed to shut down if it found itself on a machine whose codepage was set to Korean. The key logger the attackers used also has Korean characters inside and appears to have ties to a coder in South Korea.  The sophisticated nature of the key logger as well as the attack on the RSA keys indicates that DarkHotel is likely a nation-state campaign---or at least a nation-state supported campaign. If true, this would make the attack against the U.S. defense industry awkward, to say the least. Raiu says the key logger, a kernel-mode logger, is the best written and most sophisticated logger he's seen in his years as a security researcher. Kernel-mode malware is rare and difficult to pull off. Operating at the core of the machine rather than the user level where most software applications run, allows the malware to better bypass antivirus scanners and other detection systems. But kernel-mode malware requires a skillful touch since it can easily crash a system if not well-designed. ""You have to be very skilled in kernel-level development and this is already quite a rare skillset,"" says Vitaly Kamluk, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. ""Then you have to make it very stable…. It must be very stable and very well tested."" There's no logical reason to use a kernel-level keylogger says Raiu since it's so easy to write key loggers that hook the Windows API using about four lines of code. ""But these guys prefer to do a kernel-level keylogger, which is about 300 kilobytes in size---the driver for the key logger---which is pretty crazy and very unusual.  So the guy who did it is super confident in his coding skills. He knows that his code is top-notch."" The logger, which was created in 2007, appears to have been written by someone who goes by the name ""Chpie""---a name that appears in source code for the logger. Chpie is the name used by a South Korean coder who is known to have  created another kernel-level key logger  that Raiu says appears to be an earlier version of this one. The key logger in the DarkHotel attack uses some of the same source code but is more sophisticated, as if it's an upgraded version of the earlier keylogger. Aside from the sophisticated key logger, the attacker's use of digital certificates to sign their malware also points to a nation-state or nation-state supported actor. The attackers found that a certificate authority belonging to the Malaysian government as well as Deutsche Telekom were using weak 512-bit signing keys. The small key size allowed the attackers, with a little super-computing power, to factor the 512-bit RSA keys (essentially re-engineer them) to generate their own digital certificates to sign their malware. ""You very rarely, if ever, see such techniques used by APT (advanced persistent threat) groups,"" Raiu says. ""Nobody else as far as we know has managed to do something similar, despite the fact that these certificates existed for some time.... This is [an] NSA-level infection mechanism."" These sophisticated elements of the attack are important, but the most intriguing part of the DarkHotel campaign is the hotel operation. Unravelling the Mystery of DarkHotel The Kaspersky researchers first became aware of the hotel attacks last January when they got reports through their automated system about a cluster of customer infections. They traced the infections to the networks of a couple of hotels in Asia. Kamluk traveled to the hotels to see if he could determine how guests were being infected, but nothing happened to his machine. The hotels proved to be of no help when Kamluk told them what was happening to guests. But during his stay, he noticed that both hotels used the same third-party firm to manage its guest WiFi. Some hotels own and operate their network infrastructure; others use a managed services firm. The company managing the WiFi network of the two hotels Kamluk visited wishes to remain anonymous, but it was an unusually willing partner in getting to the bottom of the attacks. It acted quickly to provide Kaspersky with server images and logs to track down the attackers. Although the attackers left very few traces, ""There were certain command lines which should not have been there in the hotel system,"" a senior executive with the managed-services company says. In one case, the researchers found a reference to a malicious Windows executable in the directory of a Unix server. The file itself was long gone, but a reference pointing to its former existence remained. ""[T]there was a file-deletion record and a timestamp of when it happened,"" says Kamluk. Judging from traces left behind, the attackers had operated outside normal business hours to place their malware on the hotel system and infect guests. ""They started early in the morning before the hotel staff would arrive to the office and then after they leave the office they were also distributing the malware then,"" says the senior executive. ""This is not just something that happened yesterday. These are people who have been taking their time. They've been trying to access networks over the last years."" It's unclear how many other hotels they've attacked, but it appears the hackers cherry-pick their targets, only hitting hotels where they know their victims will be staying. When victims attempt to connect to the WiFi network, they get a pop-up alert telling them their Adobe Flash player needs an update and offering them a file, digitally signed to make it look authentic, to download. If the victims accept they download, they get a Trojan delivered instead. Crucially, the alerts pop up before guests actually get onto the WiFi network, so even if they abandon their plan to get online, they are infected the moment they hit ""accept.""  The malware doesn't then immediately go to work. Instead it sits quietly for six months before waking up and calling home to a command-and-control server.  Raiu says this is likely meant to circumvent the watchful eyes of IT departments who would be on the lookout for suspicious behavior immediately after an executive returned from a trip to Asia. At some of the hotels, only a few victims appear to have been targeted. But on other systems, it appears the attackers targeted a delegation of visitors; in that instance, evidence shows they tried to hit every device attempting to get online during a specific period of time. ""Seems like some event occurred or maybe some delegation visited the hotel and stayed there for a few days and they tried to hit as many members of the delegation as possible,"" Raiu says. He thinks the victims were ones the attackers couldn't reach through ordinary spearphishing attacks---perhaps because their work networks were carefully protected. Kaspersky still doesn't know how the attackers get onto the hotel servers. They don't live on the servers the way criminal hackers do---that is, maintain backdoor access to the servers to gain re-entry over an extended period of time. The DarkHotel attackers come in, do their deed, then erase all evidence and leave. But in the logs, the researchers found no backdoors on the systems, so either the attackers never used them or successfully erased any evidence of them. Or they had an insider who helped them pull off the attacks. The researchers don't know exactly who the attackers were targeting in the identified hotel attacks. Guests logging onto WiFi often have to enter their last name and room number in the WiFi login page, but neither Kaspersky, nor the company that maintained the WiFi network, had access to the guest information. Reports that come into Kaspersky's automated reporting system from customers are anonymous, so Kaspersky is seldom able to identify a victim beyond an IP address. The number of hotels that have been hit is also unknown. So far the researchers have found fewer than a dozen hotels with infection indicators. ""Maybe there are some hotels that … use to be infected and we just cannot learn about that because there are no traces,"" the network-management executive says. The company worked with Kaspersky to scour all of the hotel servers it manages for any traces of malware and are ""fairly confident that the malware doesn't sit on any hotel server today."" But that is just one network-management company. Presumably, the DarkHotel operation is still active on other networks. Safeguarding against such an attack can be difficult for hotel guests.  The best defense is to double check update alerts that pop up on your computer during a stay in a hotel. Go to the software vendor's site directly to see if an update has been posted and download it directly from there.  Though, of course, this won't help if the attackers are able to redirect your machine to a malicious download site.",,2023-10-20 17:06:10.668887+00:00,True,True,False,,,DarkHotel: A Sophisticated New Hacking Attack Targets High-Profile Hotel Guests - WIRED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Audi is recalling almost 102,000 A4 and S4 sedans and Allroad station wagons from the 2013-15 model years because a software problem could cause the front airbag to malfunction,  according to a report  the automaker posted Wednesday on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website. Regulators said that if those models were involved in a side-impact crash, the side airbags would deploy properly, but that if the vehicle continued to move and was involved in a secondary front-end impact, the front airbags might not work. Audi said it discovered the problem during “routine testing and ongoing field observations” and was not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the issue. In a separate action, regulators are investigating whether there should be a recall of about 20,000 Honda motorcycles for a stalling problem,  according to a report  posted on the safety agency’s website. It said the investigation was prompted by complaints from nine owners of 2011-13 CBR250R motorcycles.

The failure was related to a software problem that could cause the front airbag to malfunction. If these models were involved in a side-impact crash, the side airbags would deploy properly. However, if the vehicle continued to move and experienced a secondary front-end impact, the front airbags might not work. Audi discovered the issue during routine testing and ongoing field observations and stated that there were no accidents or injuries related to the problem.

The impact of the failure was that in the event of a secondary front-end impact, the front airbags may not deploy, potentially increasing the risk of injury to the occupants. The responsible entity for the software failure was Audi, as they discovered the problem during their testing and observations.

The impacted entities were the owners of the affected Audi vehicles, as they were at risk of the front airbags not deploying properly in certain crash scenarios. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was also involved as they posted the report about the recall on their website.

In summary, the software failure incident occurred with Audi vehicles from the 2013-15 model years, where the front airbags could malfunction in certain crash scenarios.

31883,https://money.cnn.com/2014/11/02/pf/resume-red-flags/index.html,2014-11-02 07:00:00+00:00,https://money.cnn.com,,"Published on 2014-11-02 00:00:00. When it comes to job hunting, your resume can make or break your chances ... very quickly.

Three-quarters of human resource professionals said it takes them less than five minutes to review a resume before deciding whether a job applicant makes it to the next round, according to a recent survey from the Society for Human Resource Management.

And that may be generous.

Five minutes sounded like an eternity to some of the recruiting managers who spoke to CNNMoney.

""I thought it would be a lot less. [Often] an initial screen takes 30 seconds,"" said Doug Arms, a vice president at staffing firm Kelly Services.

So, basically, think Tinder for talent.

Hiring managers and recruiters say there are telltale signs that help them weed out candidates at first glance. These are the resumes that can make an applicant seem, among other things, careless, immature or just not worth pursuing relative to the competition.

And here's the thing: Anyone, regardless of education or experience, can fall into these traps.

""I see it at every level for every type of job I've ever hired for,"" said Alison Green, an HR consultant in the Washington, D.C., area who runs AskAManager.org.

Here are seven of the biggest resume killers that hiring pros say they see all the time:

1. Using a ridiculous email address: Your college friends may know exactly why hairofthedogdude@yahoo.com is fitting for you, but recruiters and hiring managers may not be so amused.

""It just shoots your credibility,"" Arms said.

2. Making spelling errors and grammatical mistakes: Time to admit it, your mother was right. ""If you can't be trusted to proof your resume, why should I trust you with details once you're on the job?"" Arms said.

3. Including crazy fonts, colors and other graphics: Creativity is desirable in many jobs. But resumes that look like art projects are not.

""Keep the document simple and clear. If it takes too long for us to figure out where people work and what they do, they won't get too far,"" said Maryanne Rainone, managing director of Heyman Associates in New York.

Related: These resume lies are whoppers

One exception might be candidates for graphic arts jobs. Yet even in these cases the place for displaying your design skills is not the resume itself, but rather the link to the site displaying your portfolio or attachments to your work.

4. Not using keywords: Terms particular to the job you want and the relevant skills you have should feature prominently on your resume and LinkedIn profile.

Pay attention to the words in the job description, Arms said. ""Ask yourself first: 'Do I satisfy the criteria?' If so, is that reflected on your resume?""

Some employers use software to search for keywords when they are sorting through hundreds of applicants' resumes. Recruiters also use keywords to find potential candidates through LinkedIn (LNKD) and other sites.

Kelly Dingee, director of strategic recruiting at Staffing Advisors in Maryland, suggests thinking broadly about which words to use.

If she's trying to recruit for a development officer position, for instance, she'll search not just for that job title but for words like ""philanthropy,"" ""fundraising"" and ""major gifts.""

5. Stating everything but your accomplishments: Listing your day-to-day responsibilities (e.g., managing a Web site, organizing conferences) in your current and past jobs won't distinguish you from the pack.

Instead, hiring managers should be able to tell at first glance what you've accomplished (e.g., doubled sales, increased audience reach by 30%, negotiated the company's biggest deal, etc.).

6. Writing too much: Writing a book is an impressive feat, but your resume shouldn't read like one.

Recruiters won't read paragraph after paragraph. They'd much prefer short, bulleted points.

7. Forgetting to include dates: The years that you worked at every job you held should be easily scannable.

Otherwise, ""it looks like someone is trying to hide something,"" Rainone said.

Do you blend your vacations with working days? Not just sending a few emails, but putting in full 8-hour working days remotely from an exotic location, then taking a few days off? Share your story and you could be featured in an upcoming CNNMoney article.",,2023-10-20 17:09:48.877349+00:00,True,False,,,,What makes a recruiter reject your resume in seconds? - CNN.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31936,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/21/e-cigarettes-malware-computers,2014-11-21 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2014-11-21 00:00:00. E-cigarettes may be better for your health than normal ones, but spare a thought for your poor computer – electronic cigarettes have become the latest vector for malicious software, according to online reports.

Many e-cigarettes can be charged over USB, either with a special cable, or by plugging the cigarette itself directly into a USB port. That might be a USB port plugged into a wall socket or the port on a computer – but, if so, that means that a cheap e-cigarette from an untrustworthy supplier gains physical access to a device.

A report on social news site Reddit suggests that at least one “vaper” has suffered the downside of trusting their cigarette manufacturer. “One particular executive had a malware infection on his computer from which the source could not be determined,” the user writes. “After all traditional means of infection were covered, IT started looking into other possibilities.

“The made in China e-cigarette had malware hardcoded into the charger, and when plugged into a computer’s USB port the malware phoned home and infected the system.”

Rik Ferguson, a security consultant for Trend Micro, says the story is entirely plausible. “Production line malware has been around for a few years, infecting photo frames, MP3 players and more,” he says. In 2008, for instance, a photo frame produced by Samsung shipped with malware on the product’s install disc.

Even more concerning is a recent proof-of-concept attack called “BadUSB”, which involves reprogramming USB devices at the hardware level. “Very widely spread USB controller chips, including those in thumb drives, have no protection from such reprogramming,” says Berlin-based firm SRLabs, which released the code.

Combine the two, says Ferguson, “and a very strong case can be made for enterprises disabling USB ports, or at least using device management to allow only authorised devices.

“For consumers it’s a case of running up-to-date anti-malware for the production line stuff and only using trusted devices to counter the threat.”

Dave Goss, of London’s Vape Emporium, says that vapers can remain safe by buying from respected manufacturers such as Aspire, KangerTech and Innokin, and by checking for “scratch checkers” on the box, which mark out authentic goods from counterfeits.

“Any electrical device that uses a USB charger could be targeted in this way, and just about every one of these electrical devices will come from China,” he adds.

In early November, figures obtained by the Press Association revealed that e-cigarettes and related equipment, such as chargers, were involved in more than 100 fires in less than two years.",,2023-10-20 17:14:13.224840+00:00,True,True,False,,,Health warning: Now e-cigarettes can give you malware - The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DETROIT (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co 7201.T said on Tuesday it is recalling more than 14,000 hybrid Infiniti Q50 and Q70 luxury sedans globally due to possible software and transmission issues.

Nissan is recalling 14,438 Q50 and Q70 hybrid sedans from model year 2014 because the electric motor may stop running due to a communications error between the motor inverter and transmission control module, according to the company and documents posted online with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

Of the affected vehicles, 7,539 were sold in Japan, 5,412 in United States and territories, and the rest in other markets, Nissan said.

The stall-like condition can occur when the electric motor stops working and may increase the risk of a crash, according to the NHTSA documents. The issue does not occur when the car is operating at highway speeds while the internal combustion engine is in use, according to the NHTSA documents.

Nissan discovered the problem after a “field incident” in Japan in late August, according to the NHTSA documents. It found no incidents in the U.S. market, according to the NHTSA.

Nissan will reprogram the motor inverter software at no cost, according to the NHTSA. The recall is expected to begin in mid-November.

In a separate action, Nissan also is recalling 1,641 Q50, Q70 and Q70L hybrid sedans from the same model year because a small number have automatic transmission housings that may have cracks caused during manufacturing by the supplier, according to the NHTSA.

The recall affects 817 cars sold in the United States and its territories, 520 in Japan and the rest in other markets, Nissan said.

Over time, a crack could lead to a larger fracture, producing on-road debris and increasing the risk of a crash, according to the NHTSA. Nissan is not aware of any complaints, injuries or accidents related to this issue.

A new transmission assembly will be installed if any cracks are found by the dealers, according to the NHTSA. The recall is expected to begin in mid-November.

A Nissan spokesman said there may be overlap between the two recalls.

In Japan, the cars in both recalls are marketed as the Nissan Skyline, Fuga and Cima, the Japanese automaker said.",,2023-10-20 17:22:02.858422+00:00,True,True,True,,0.7682136611440094,"Nissan recalls Infiniti hybrid sedans for software, transmission issues - Reuters",Nissan Recalls Hybrid Infiniti Q50 and Q70 Sedans for Software and Transmission Issues,"The software failure incident occurred in late August and involved the hybrid Infiniti Q50 and Q70 luxury sedans from model year 2014.

The Shelby Mustang GT/SC has muscle in all the right places

Nov 3, 2014 Automobiles

[MUSIC] This is a Mustang. I've never driven a Mustang before. We don't get them in the UK, at least not. For now but I figured if I was gonna pop my Mustang cherry, I may as well do it with something a little bit silly. So this isn't any regular Mustang. No, this is a Shelby Mustang GTSC. The guys at Shelby thought the regular Mustang was just a little too staid. So they made this one a little bit special. [MUSIC] There's a rafter changes over the car you get from Ford. A fancy grill, stripes, a new bumper, a fiberglass bonnet, Ford racing springs, new wheels, upgraded exhaust, a short throw shift and much more besides. For the SC, they've also thrown in a supercharger, which means you can have 525 or 624 horsepower. Now that sounds like the kind of Mustang I should be starting with. [NOISE]. The Shelby badge on the back can't hurt either. Carroll Shelby was an automotive giant. You know the Cobra, that was his baby. He took the GT 40 and ran with it, turned it into a Le Mans winner. He helped develop the Ford GT and the Dodge Viper. Viper. Before he started making silly fast cars he was also an ace racing driver. Amongst his many achievements he can count winning Le Mans. So this should be quite good. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [NOISE] This generation of mustang is being phased out and the new one is coming in. That one is going to find it's way to Europe. It's going to have an EU-friendly engine and bits in it and what have you. So I figured now is the perfect time to take a bite of this soon to be extinct forbidden fruit. My first mustang experience. Well it has been interesting really, this car is mad. One of the first things that got me is just the size of the thing, the look of it, the beauty of it, it is a stunning looking car, what shall we do to it to differentiate it from the standard Mustang, it really sets off, especially that grill. Really, really like that. The power it [UNKNOWN] out is massive. The noise it makes is enormous. More on that later. But it still feels a little bit lazy. It's not super-high revving like you get from a Jag or anything like that. [NOISE] This thing is antisocially loud. Even a. Tick over is disgustingly noisy. That's brilliant in my book, that's absolutely brilliant. When it's at full chat, God the noise is glorious and it just fires its way out of the car and upsetting everything nearby. [NOISE] The amount of power it has if you do give it a little bit of a tickle the back end does get a little bit wiggly which is not a bad thing. The springs on this have been upgraded to give it a further more sporting ride and that it does [INAUDIBLE]. I don't jump in it and think, oh I can't wait to go [INAUDIBLE]. Bring about in this, today, instead of just, well I feel like I'm driving a rocket sled. When you compare this to cars with similar power you get back in the UK, well, this doesn't seem like a great deal. Because while it's, yes it's got massive power. And it makes a great noise when you're on it. Dynamically it's ok. And the interior's very plasticky and a bit tacky and these gauges look like they've come out of Halfords. Now compare that to the likes of the Jag S-Type. Beautiful car, [UNKNOWN], handles really well. XFR-S, BMW M5, big cars, similar power. They're just better. However if you then start comparing it to cars with similar fronts, well then this become a completely different proposition. Because you've got yourself big power, a great noise, and it looks like a Mustang. Mm. [NOISE] I kinda ike the sound of that. [NOISE] I've driven it today from L.A. to Vegas. And I cannot think of a more perfect car to do the driving. It's flaws just don't map. Sod the plastic. Sod the noise. There's a fuel station every 30 seconds. Fuel isn't that expensive and the roads are just straight lines. So you can just [UNKNOWN]. And listens to the noise at full chat. And this thing has so much torque that you can't just really leave it in six and cruise. [NOISE] This should be an alien concept to me. It's not got a smooth hyper design body like the V8s you find in German things it's. Not got super-advanced hyper tech and it doesn't have a badge on the nose that back home might associate with power like this. This is a Ford. A Ford that looks like many other Fords you see on the roads out here but that adds to its charm. [MUSIC] This car represents a really big bit of the culture I've been enjoying out here in the States. The desire to put your own stamp on a car. To make it your own. Road. This started out as Mustang GT. It's not an expensive car, and you get decent power to your money, about 420 horsepower. That's a proper slice [UNKNOWN] American muscle but for some the base car simply isn't enough. They want more to do more with it. To take the contextually mundane and make it something more. That's why they try to build cars like this, to make something bigger, madder, faster, noisier, what have you. To make it their own. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] Many people, myself included, are pretty down on US cars. They say they're big, they're loud, they're noisy, they're thirsty. They've got naff interiors and naff handling dynamics. And elsewhere in the world, that would be an apt thing to say. However, here in context. None of that really matters. The performance is cheap and you find yourself with an instant connection to one of the greatest American muscle cars ever made. Everywhere else in the world, this probably wouldn't make sense, but here on home soil. [MUSIC] So don't be special.

56255,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/16/amazon-compensate-sellers-1p-price,2014-12-16 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2014-12-16 00:00:00. Amazon has told selling partners who have lost tens of thousands of pounds after a software glitch led to their stock being sold for 1p that they will not get compensation from the online retailer.

The company, which had sales of more than $74bn (£48bn) last year, has emailed sellers to tell them that “as of now Amazon will not be providing any reimbursements for this issue”.

In an email seen by the Guardian, an Amazon “seller support” worker said: “I completely understand how stressful this time may be.

“As of now Amazon will not be providing any reimbursements for this issue. You will need to contact the third party software who are responsible for this error.”

The email to Go2Games, which estimates it lost £10,000 as a result of the glitch, signs off with “have a nice day”.

Sellers report that RepricerExpress, the third-party company behind the faulty software, has also not offered compensation. The Derry-based company has said it is “truly sorry for the distress this has caused our customers”.

Amazon would not say whether it carried out due diligence into RepricerExpress’s software reliability.

Daniel Pizzey, who said his baby clothing company Baby Best Buy has lost £25,000-£30,000 as a result of the glitch, said: “I am totally disgusted at the way Amazon has dealt with this matter.

“Their reactions have been so slow and they have not once cared about the financial situation facing their sellers, especially at the most important time of the year.

“For a company the size of Amazon, and also being one of the biggest companies in the world, they have failed as a company and not cared about our items in which they are meant to have a duty of care to look after them while they are in their possession.”

Pizzey said his company was swamped with 30-40 orders a minute during the 1p glitch on Friday night. “Customers were ordering like 40-50 of the same items and just paying 50p for it. Surely Amazon would have picked up on this and questioned it before sending it out?”

Amazon, which said on Monday it had “reached out to all the sellers that were affect”, declined to comment on Tuesday.",,2023-10-28 11:01:56.083633+00:00,True,True,True,,0.7852853330997455,Amazon refuses to compensate sellers for 1p price glitch - The Guardian,Amazon Refuses Compensation for Software Glitch That Sold Stock for 1p,"The software failure incident occurred on Friday night, resulting in a glitch that caused stock to be sold for 1p on Amazon. The system that failed was the third-party software called RepricerExpress, which is responsible for repricing products on the platform. The cause of the failure was a software glitch in RepricerExpress. The impact of the failure was significant financial losses for the selling partners, with some estimating losses of tens of thousands of pounds. The responsible entity for the failure was RepricerExpress, as stated in the email from Amazon's ""seller support"" worker. The impacted entities were the selling partners who lost money due to the glitch. Amazon informed the selling partners that they would not be providing any reimbursements for the issue and advised them to contact RepricerExpress for resolution. RepricerExpress also did not offer compensation to the affected sellers. The article does not mention whether Amazon conducted due diligence on RepricerExpress's software reliability. Some selling partners expressed their dissatisfaction with Amazon's handling of the matter, criticizing the company for its slow reaction and lack of concern for the financial situation of the sellers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[-0.0196988545358181, -0.02202983945608139, -0.00318826362490654, -0.011142922565340996, -0.013729912228882313, 0.008104556240141392,
