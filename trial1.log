2023-11-10 21:42:53,163 INFO: The software failure incident occurred during a presentation at the CanSecWest conference in Vancouver. The system that failed was the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) on multiple PCs from companies like Dell, Lenovo, and HP. The cause of the failure was the discovery of vulnerabilities in the BIOS code, which the researchers referred to as incursion vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities allowed the researchers to remotely infect the BIOS and gain escalated privileges on the system. They developed a malware called LightEater to exploit these vulnerabilities and demonstrated how quickly and easily they could compromise the BIOS.

The impact of this failure is significant, as it highlights the potential dangers of firmware hacking and the lack of security measures in place to protect against such attacks. The researchers noted that if a government agent or law enforcement officer were to gain physical access to a system, they could infect the BIOS in just two minutes. This demonstrates the ease with which a system can be compromised and the potential for unauthorized access and control.

The responsible entities for this failure are the researchers, Xeno Kovah and Corey Kallenberg, who presented the proof-of-concept attack. They uncovered the vulnerabilities and developed the malware to exploit them. The impacted entities are the PCs from companies like Dell, Lenovo, and HP, as well as specialized operating systems like Tails, which are used by journalists and activists for secure communications. These systems are at risk of being compromised and having their security undermined due to the vulnerabilities in the BIOS. [34475]

2023-11-10 21:43:36,519 INFO: The software failure incident occurred when personal information of users on the SanrioTown.com website, a community for fans of Hello Kitty, was left accessible due to a misconfiguration of a database. The failure occurred for nearly a month, and anyone who knew the internet address of the database could have accessed it. The cause of the failure was a simple misconfiguration, which left the database open to public access without a password or authentication.

The impact of the failure was that approximately 3.3 million accounts were vulnerable, with personal information such as names, ages, and genders being at risk. This information belonged to users of the SanrioTown.com website. However, there is no indication that any personal information was actually stolen.

The responsible entity for the failure was Sanrio Digital, a company part-owned by Sanrio Co Ltd, the Japanese owner of the Hello Kitty brand. They were notified of the issue by security researcher Chris Vickery and subsequently fixed the holes in the three servers. The impacted entity was the SanrioTown.com website and its users, who had their personal information exposed and at risk for nearly a month.

This incident is significant as it follows a similar breach of electronic toymaker VTech Holdings Ltd, where millions of records of parents and children were compromised. However, in this case, the hacker who found the vulnerability did not steal the data but shared some of it with a researcher and had no plans to sell it. A 21-year old man was arrested in connection with the VTech hack. [57308]

2023-11-10 21:44:06,725 INFO: The software failure incident occurred in the GSM network, which is a mobile communication system. The failure was caused by vulnerabilities in the network's encryption and security measures. The encryption key used to secure communication sessions could be easily decrypted and recorded within a few minutes. This vulnerability allowed the location of target phones to be more precisely identified by intercepting and manipulating SMS messages. The researchers were able to create a network sniffer by replacing the firmware of a Motorola GSM phone, enabling them to access raw data from the cell network. Additionally, the system messages exchanged within the network used a much older standard, making it easier for attackers to predict their content. The use of a precomputed encryption key table allowed for fast discovery of session encryption keys. The impact of this failure is significant as it compromises the security and privacy of GSM network users. Law enforcement agencies have traditionally had access to similar capabilities, but this research makes it more accessible to tech-savvy individuals. The responsible entity for the failure is the GSM network operators, as they did not adequately address the security flaws and shortcuts in their technology and operations. The entities impacted by this failure are the users of the GSM network, as their communication and privacy are compromised. [54198]

2023-11-10 21:44:36,423 INFO: The software failure incident occurred in the Chevrolet Impala sedans and Land Rover vehicles. The failure was related to the electronic airbag system in both cases. In the Impala sedans, the failure was suspected to be caused by a faulty software algorithm that controls the passenger-side airbag. On the other hand, in the Land Rover vehicles, a problem with the system's memory was believed to be causing faulty computer signals.

The failure impacted the passenger-side airbag deployment in both vehicles. In the Impala sedans, the investigation was prompted by a formal complaint filed by an engineer who discovered that the passenger-side airbag did not deploy in a crash, despite the passenger weighing 170 pounds. The Land Rover vehicles were recalled because the passenger-side airbag may fail to deploy in a crash due to a system issue that determines whether someone is sitting in the passenger seat.

The responsible entities for the failure are the manufacturers of the vehicles, including Chevrolet and Jaguar Land Rover. It is important to note that the failure was not reported to have caused any accidents or incidents at the time of the information provided.

The impacted entities are the owners and drivers of the affected vehicles, as their safety is compromised by the potential failure of the passenger-side airbag. Additionally, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an inquiry into the potential failure of the airbags in the Chevrolet Impala sedans based on a defect petition filed by an engineer at a California crash analysis company.

In summary, the software failure incidents affected the passenger-side airbag deployment in the Chevrolet Impala sedans and Land Rover vehicles. The failures were suspected to be caused by faulty software algorithms and problems with the system's memory. The responsible entities were the manufacturers of the vehicles, and the impacted entities were the owners and drivers of the affected vehicles. [28933]

2023-11-10 21:45:04,914 INFO: The software failure incident occurred when a security company, Lookout, discovered that over 50 apps in the Android Market were infected. The failure took place within the four days prior to Lookout's findings. The system that failed was the Android platform, specifically the infected apps that were downloaded by users. The cause of the failure was an injection of root exploit code into popular free apps by an entity called "Myournet". This code allowed the apps to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access to the user's phone. The impact of the failure was significant, with between 50,000 and 200,000 downloads of the infected apps during the four-day period. The failure compromised the security and privacy of the users who downloaded the apps, potentially leading to unauthorized access to personal data. The responsible entity for the failure was "Myournet", who injected the exploit code into the popular apps and republished them. The impacted entity was the users who downloaded the infected apps from the Android Market. Google took quick action by pulling the infected apps from the market, showing their efforts to mitigate the impact of the failure. [4722]

2. Enhanced security protocols within the Android operating system itself to detect and prevent privilege escalation attacks.
3. Regular security audits and inspections of apps available on the Android Market to identify and remove any malicious or unauthorized apps.
4. Improved user education and awareness about the risks of downloading and installing apps from unknown or untrusted sources.
5. Swift and efficient response and action from Google or relevant authorities to promptly remove and deactivate any infected apps from both the Android Market and devices to prevent further spread and damage. [4722]

2023-11-10 21:45:36,996 INFO: The software failure incident occurred during the first launch attempt of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket on Saturday morning, May 21, 2012. The system that failed was the combustion chamber of engine five, one of the nine Merlin engines used in the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket. The cause of the failure was a faulty valve, which led to higher than acceptable pressure in the combustion chamber.

The impact of the failure was an aborted launch, as the flight computer detected the high pressure and shut down the engines, preventing the rocket from lifting off. The failure occurred at the last-half-second before launch. The responsible entity for the failure was SpaceX, as they were the ones conducting the launch and operating the Falcon 9 rocket.

The impacted entities were SpaceX themselves, as they had to replace the faulty valve and plan for a second launch attempt. Additionally, the launch delay impacted the timeline for delivering the Dragon capsule to the International Space Station. However, the simulations showed that the launch may have been successful even with the high pressure, but SpaceX chose to stop and fix the issue rather than risking launching with a potentially faulty valve. This incident highlights the importance of conducting thorough testing and ensuring the reliability of software and hardware components in space exploration missions. [12053]

2023-11-10 21:46:45,710 INFO: The software failure incident occurred three months after the first fatal crash involving a Tesla driving in autopilot mode. Hackers were able to take remote control of a Tesla Model S from a distance of 12 miles, interfering with various electronically controlled features in the car. The system that failed was the car's controller area network (Can bus), which is a collection of connected computers that control different aspects of the vehicle. The cause of the failure was a vulnerability that allowed the hackers to gain control of the Can bus by exploiting the car's web browser when connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot. This required the car to be physically near the hotspot as well.

The impact of the failure was significant, as the hackers were able to manipulate the car's brakes, door locks, and dashboard computer screen, among other features. This compromised the safety and functionality of the high-tech vehicle.

The responsible entity for the failure was the hacking team, who targeted and exploited the vulnerabilities in Tesla's software. However, the researchers who discovered the vulnerabilities acted responsibly by disclosing them to Tesla. Tesla responded quickly by creating a software update that was delivered over-the-air to address the vulnerabilities.

The impacted entity was Tesla and its customers who owned the affected models, namely the Tesla Model S P85 and Model 75D. The risk to customers was deemed very low by Tesla, but the incident highlighted the need for prompt response and continued efforts to ensure the security of Tesla's software systems. [47732]

2023-11-10 21:47:26,362 INFO: The software failure incident occurred when researchers at a college engineering professor's team discovered flaws in the software of Internet-connected devices used by customers, including those in cars and ride-sharing services like Uber. The researchers presented their findings at the Usenix computer conference in Washington, D.C., but emphasized that the attacks they demonstrated had not been seen in real life yet. The system that failed was the software running on these devices, allowing them unfettered access to a car's internal controls. The cause of the failure was the lack of proper design and security measures in the software. The impact of the failure is that these devices pose a significant threat to the safety and security of vehicles, as they can be hacked and manipulated remotely. The responsible entities for the failure are the device makers who did not initially address the flaws in their software.

2023-11-10 21:47:56,440 INFO: The software failure incident occurred when researcher Billy Rios discovered four critical vulnerabilities in the management software of Hospira pumps. These vulnerabilities allowed hackers to install malware on the pumps and potentially distribute unauthorized drug libraries or alter their configurations. One of the vulnerabilities was a plaintext password hardcoded into the software, making it easy for attackers to exploit a SQL database. The incident was reported to the Department of Homeland Security's ICS-CERT and the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees the certification of the pumps.

The impact of the software failure was the potential for unauthorized access to the pumps, compromising the integrity and safety of drug delivery. This could lead to potential harm to patients if the drug libraries were altered or unauthorized drugs were administered. The vulnerability allowed hackers to remotely access the pumps without the need for the pump to contact a trusted server. The failure occurred in the management software of Hospira pumps.

The responsible entity for the incident was Hospira, the manufacturer of the pumps. They had hardcoded a plaintext password and failed to adequately secure the software. The impacted entity was the healthcare facilities using these pumps, as they were at risk of compromised drug delivery and unauthorized access to the pumps. [35057]

2023-11-10 21:48:39,631 INFO: The software failure incident occurred when MoboTap, the developer of Dolphin HD, a mobile web browser for Android devices, released an update that introduced a security vulnerability. The failure happened prior to the published statement on October 29 at 4 p.m. PT. The system that failed was the Dolphin HD browser itself. The cause of failure was a flaw in the design that allowed anyone with knowledge of a specific URL to take over a user's session. This was due to the browser checking the user's URL against a database of supported webzines without proper security measures. The impact of the failure was that users' sessions could be hijacked, potentially exposing their sensitive data. The responsible entity for the failure was MoboTap, the developer of Dolphin HD. The impacted entities were the users of the Dolphin HD browser who were vulnerable to session hijacking. The failure was criticized by Seth Schoen of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Lauren Weinstein of People For Internet Responsibility, both highlighting the lack of forethought and disregard for basic privacy practices shown by the developers. MoboTap released a subsequent update, version 7.0.2, to fix the security issues, but this incident raised concerns about the privacy and security practices of Dolphin HD. [8625]

The issue allowed someone who knew the URL to take over the user's session. The impact of the security snafu was downplayed by Alan Cooper, a spokesman for MoboTap, stating that they have never stored anyone's user data and have no intention to do so. However, it is mentioned that the Dolphin HD update notice in the Android Market did not specify what was actually changed in version 7.0.2, raising concerns about the authors' ignorance regarding basic privacy practices and disclosures. A hot fix was released, but it was mentioned that it did not fix the URL concern, so version 7.0.2 was then published to fix all URL issues. There seems to be some discrepancy regarding whether version 7.0.1 still forwards URLs, which Cooper said he would bring to the attention of the developers to double-check. Overall, the software failure incident led to a security vulnerability that allowed unauthorized access to user sessions. [8625]

2023-11-10 21:59:15,727 INFO: In this software failure incident, Chinese researchers announced that they discovered security vulnerabilities in the Tesla Model S. The failure occurred when the vehicle’s web browser was in use and connected to a malicious WiFi hotspot. The researchers were able to remotely take control of the vehicle's brakes and other functions.

The cause of the failure was a software bug that allowed unauthorized access to the vehicle's systems. The impact of the failure was potentially severe as it gave the researchers the ability to control critical functions of the car. However, Tesla stated that the risk to their customers was very low and the vulnerabilities would only be accessible under specific circumstances.

Tesla was the responsible entity and they responded quickly to the reported vulnerabilities. Within 10 days of being informed, Tesla deployed an over-the-air software update to fix the problem. They also acknowledged the researchers' findings and confirmed the hack. In response, Tesla plans to reward the researchers under their bug bounty program, which offers cash rewards for uncovering problems in the software.

While the researchers only tested their method on multiple varieties of the Tesla Model S, they suggested that it was reasonable to assume that other Tesla models were affected as well. Overall, this incident highlighted the security risks associated with sophisticated software and online connectivity in automotive systems. [47966]

2023-11-10 21:59:46,197 INFO: The software failure incident occurred on Apple devices running iOS 4 onwards, including both iPhones and iPads. The failure involved a misunderstanding in the wording of the settings regarding app downloads over cellular networks. James Morris, the victim of this flaw, reported that Apple ignored his complaints about it. He discovered that the flaw existed when Vodafone sent him frequent alerts for every 5MB downloaded, hindering his ability to turn off data in time. Apple has not made any official comment on the issue, but sources suggest that the misunderstanding lies in the wording of the settings on the iPhone. Morris pointed out that the manual Apple provides and the text on the settings page were misleading, and even Apple Care seemed to not fully understand the setting's functionality. The failure impacted the ability of users to control their data usage, leading to unexpected downloads over mobile networks. The responsible entity for the incident is Apple, as they developed and distributed the software with the misleading settings. The impacted entity is James Morris, along with potentially other Apple device users who may have experienced similar issues. The failure occurred consistently when users attempted to manage their app downloads over cellular networks, resulting in excessive data usage. [54517]

2023-11-10 22:00:17,274 INFO: The software failure incident occurred less than two weeks after a massive botnet attack using insecure web-connected home devices caused internet disruptions. Researchers discovered a security flaw in Philips Hue smart bulbs, as well as other ZigBee communication devices. The incident involved a hack where researchers were able to manipulate the Philips Hue smart bulbs using a drone. 

The cause of the failure was identified as a security vulnerability within the smart bulbs and the ZigBee communication protocol. The researchers were able to carry out the hack with a few hundred dollars worth of equipment, without intercepting a firmware update from Philips. This highlighted the difficulty in ensuring security, even for a large company implementing standard cryptographic techniques.

The impact of the failure was limited since the researchers disclosed their findings to Philips, who quickly responded with a security update. The company proactively addressed the issue before it became public, minimizing the risk to customers and the overall impact of the vulnerability. Philips Lighting representatives confirmed that the researchers did not release a virus or provide the necessary information for others to create one. Their findings assisted Philips in developing and releasing the required software update.

The responsible entity in this incident was the researchers who discovered the security flaw and demonstrated the potential attack. They worked in cooperation with Philips to address the vulnerability and improve security. The impacted entity was primarily Philips Hue smart bulb users who were exposed to potential attacks before the security update was implemented. However, the risk was considered low, and Philips recommended all customers install the latest software update to mitigate any remaining vulnerabilities. The incident emphasized the importance of regular software updates and the challenges faced by companies in preventing software failures and maintaining security. [49785]

2023-11-10 22:00:48,382 INFO: The software failure incident occurred when a utility company's SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system was compromised and experienced physical destruction. The exact timing of the failure is unknown, but it was discovered after two to three months of operators noticing glitches in remote access. The specific cause of the failure was due to the hacker using default usernames and passwords to breach the system. The impact of the failure was significant as it resulted in physical destruction and raised concerns about the potential compromise of other water utilities' networks. The responsible entity(s) for the attack are unknown as the report did not name the utility company or the software vendor that was initially hacked. The impacted entity(s) in this incident is the utility company whose SCADA system was compromised and experienced physical destruction. Additionally, there is a potential risk to other water utilities who may have their networks compromised but are currently unaware of the attack. Overall, this incident highlights the need for improved cybersecurity measures to detect and prevent similar software failures in critical infrastructure systems. [8964, 8870]

2023-11-10 22:01:24,212 INFO: The software failure incident occurred in March 2016 when Hewlett-Packard (HP) released an update that caused their printers to reject ink cartridges produced or refilled by third parties. This failure impacted the printer systems, specifically the printer software that verified the authenticity and compatibility of ink cartridges. The cause of the failure was a "ticking timebomb" left by the manufacturer in the update, which created a software code that prevented the printer from accepting non-HP cartridges.

The impact of this failure was twofold. First, it affected the affected users who were using third-party ink cartridges. Their printers would no longer recognize the ink cartridges and would refuse to print, forcing users to purchase HP-branded cartridges. Second, this failure had a delayed-action effect on the printers that received the software update six months prior. The delayed effect prevented affected users from informing others about the issue, potentially discouraging others from updating their own printers and avoiding the failure.

The responsible entity for this failure was Hewlett-Packard, as they had released the software update. However, the context also mentions the similarity between this incident and a previous one involving Lexmark printers. In that case, Lexmark (then an IBM division) had sued Static Controls for violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act by reverse-engineering toner cartridges. This contextual information suggests that other entities may have contributed to the failure, such as the manufacturer of the ink cartridges or potential legal constraints faced by HP.

Overall, this software failure incident occurred in March 2016, affecting Hewlett-Packard printers by rejecting third-party ink cartridges due to a software update. The failure caused an inability to print for users and potentially discouraged others from updating their printers. Hewlett-Packard was the primary responsible entity, but other factors, such as previous legal cases and the manufacturing of the ink cartridges, may have contributed to the failure. [47715]

2023-11-10 22:02:00,381 INFO: The software failure incident occurred with the original iPhone and continued for almost three years. The system that failed was the signal strength indicator on the iPhone, which displayed two more bars than it should have. The cause of the failure was a software glitch in the formula used to calculate the number of signal bars to display. This glitch led to incorrect signal strength representation in various signal conditions. The impact of the failure was reception problems reported by users and a drop in signal bars. Apple was responsible for the failure as they were the ones who developed the software and used the incorrect formula. The incident affected Apple as the developer of the software and the iPhone users who experienced the reception problems. [2321, 2375]

2023-11-10 22:12:32,476 INFO: The software failure incident occurred last Wednesday when the Curiosity rover experienced problems during its scheduled downtime. The system that failed was the active flight computer's solid-state memory, which suffered from data corruption. The cause of the failure was suspected to be space radiation, specifically a "single-event upset" where an energetic particle affected the memory addresses. The corruption was found in the memory's directory, which tracks data storage locations.

The impact of the failure was that Curiosity failed to send back expected science data and did not put itself to sleep during downtime. This disrupted the rover's operations and limited its ability to conduct scientific experiments. The affected entity was the Curiosity rover itself, which was unable to perform its intended functions due to the software failure.

The responsible entity for addressing the software failure is the computer experts at JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory). They are facing a catch-22 situation because allowing the software to boot up and write data could potentially destroy evidence that would help determine the cause of the initial failure. Therefore, they are cautious in proceeding with the B-side computer, as they want to understand the issues with the A-side memory before fully relying on the backup.

In summary, the software failure incident occurred on Wednesday, impacting the Curiosity rover's active flight computer's solid-state memory. The cause of the failure was suspected to be space radiation, leading to data corruption in the memory's directory. The responsible entity is the computer experts at JPL, while the entity impacted is the Curiosity rover itself, which experienced disruptions in sending data and functioning properly. [17558]

2023-11-10 22:13:05,339 INFO: Due to the software failure incident, the Curiosity rover failed to send back science data as expected and did not put itself to sleep during scheduled downtime. The engineers discovered data corruption in the solid-state memory used by the rover's active flight computer. As a result, science operations were interrupted, and the flight controllers had to put the craft in a low-activity "safe mode" while implementing a computer swap. The limited science operations were expected to resume shortly. [17558]

2023-11-10 22:13:26,600 INFO: The software failure incident occurred on March 20, 2013, at 2pm local time. The system that failed was the Microsoft Windows machines belonging to banks and broadcasting companies in South Korea. The cause of failure was a logic bomb embedded in the malware code, which dictated the date and time for the attack to begin. The logic bomb triggered the wiping of the hard drives and master boot record of the affected machines. As a result, at least three banks and two media companies experienced data loss and disruption. Some ATMs were also put out of operation, preventing South Koreans from withdrawing cash. The responsible entity for the attack was a threat researcher from FortiGuard Labs, the research division of Fortinet, a security firm based in Vancouver. The impacted entities were the banks, broadcasting companies, and the South Korean population who were affected by the disrupted ATM services. The malware used in the attack consisted of four files, with one called AgentBase.exe triggering the wiping process. The malware was likely introduced through a malicious email attachment, posing as a message from a bank, which downloaded additional files from various URLs. The incident highlights the damaging impact of cyberattacks and the need for robust security measures to protect sensitive systems and data. [17638]

2023-11-10 22:14:37,240 INFO: In this software failure incident, Mazda is recalling 2014 Mazda 3 and 2014-2015 Mazda 6 cars due to a problem with the regenerative engine braking system. The failure occurs in heavy rain or deep puddles where the generator belt can get wet, causing the engine to cut out without warning. This results in a loss of power assist for the steering and brakes. The failure occurred after Mazda knew about the problem last summer and was asked by the agency why it didn't recall the vehicles sooner.

The impact of this failure is significant as it can lead to a loss of power assist for steering and brakes, resulting in a potential loss of control and an increased risk of accidents. The impacted entity is the driver of the affected Mazda vehicles.

Mazda initially argued that no recall was needed because a warning light was illuminated, indicating the failure. However, the automaker ultimately decided to issue a recall in the United States after government safety officials in Japan insisted on a recall in their country. Therefore, Mazda is responsible for the software failure and the subsequent recall.

The failure occurred in the regenerative engine braking system and was caused by the generator belt getting wet in heavy rain or deep puddles. The failure impairs the functionality of the engine, resulting in a loss of power assist for the steering and brakes. [26371]

2023-11-10 22:15:01,624 INFO: Based on the given context, the software failure incident occurred on August 26, 2011, during a fated flight in Missouri. The specific software system that failed is not mentioned in the context provided. The cause of the failure was attributed to an overtired pilot who failed to perform adequate preflight safety checks, which would have revealed that the helicopter was low on fuel. The pilot's decision to continue the flight without sufficient fuel led to the crash. The impact of the software failure was the loss of four lives, including the pilot, nurse, paramedic, and the patient being transported to the hospital. The responsible entity for the failure is the pilot, who neglected to perform the necessary safety checks. The impacted entities include the people on board the helicopter and their families, as well as the broader aviation industry, which may face changes in training and regulations as a result of the incident. The specific software failure or any direct involvement of software in the incident is not mentioned in the given context. [18017]

2023-11-10 22:15:57,963 INFO: The software failure incident occurred during the launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Nine Merlin rocket engines had started, but engine five was experiencing high pressure. As a result, the launch software took over and aborted the liftoff. The failure occurred due to a lack of sufficient fuel in the combustion chamber, although the root cause of the high pressure is not yet determined. The failure impacted the launch schedule, causing a delay until the next opportunity on Tuesday at 3:44 a.m. EDT. The responsible entity for the failure was not the software, but rather the engine itself. In a post abort press conference, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell stated that it was not a failure because they intentionally aborted the launch instead of proceeding with an engine trending towards failure. The incident did not result in a setback for SpaceX, except for a few days on the schedule. The impacted entity was the Falcon 9 rocket, and further inspection is required to determine if the engine can be fixed or if it needs to be swapped out for another engine. [11798]

2023-11-10 22:16:32,057 INFO: The software failure incident occurred on Wednesday when the TweetDeck Chrome plugin experienced a security vulnerability. The vulnerability allowed attackers to insert computer code into tweets. Once these tweets appeared on TweetDeck, the code could run actions and be re-tweeted to other accounts, spreading the problem. Users of the Chrome browser version of TweetDeck reported receiving random pop-up windows with unsafe messages.

The incident was caused by an Austrian programming teenager named Florian, who discovered that using '&hearts' created a heart symbol in HTML. This created an opening in TweetDeck's software, enabling someone to inject computer program commands via a tweet, leading to a software bug.

The impact of the failure was significant, as users experienced unwanted pop-up windows containing unsafe messages. Additionally, the incident raised concerns about data compromise. It is unknown if any data was actually compromised, but experts warned of the possibility.

Responsibility for the failure lies with the TweetDeck software and its security vulnerabilities. Florian inadvertently discovered the vulnerability and disclosed it by posting a tweet about it. Twitter was also responsible for the failure, as they pushed out a code fix earlier in the day that was intended to address the security hole but ended up being ineffective.

The impacted entity was TweetDeck, as its software was compromised and users experienced the effects of the vulnerability. Twitter, as the parent company of TweetDeck, was also impacted by the incident. Overall, the failure highlighted the importance of robust software security and the potential risks associated with software bugs and vulnerabilities. [27574]

2023-11-10 22:16:41,178 INFO: The software failure incident in this context could have been prevented by implementing proper input validation and sanitization techniques. By not allowing special characters like "&hearts" to be interpreted as commands, the vulnerability could have been avoided. Additionally, regular security audits and testing could have detected the vulnerability before it was exploited. [27574]

2023-11-10 22:16:44,355 INFO: The software failure in this incident was due to both system design and operation faults. The system design fault was the vulnerability in TweetDeck's software that allowed someone to inject computer program commands via a tweet. The operation fault was the action taken by the Austrian programming teenager to exploit this vulnerability by making a heart symbol that caused the software to crash. Both of these factors contributed to the software failure incident. [27574]

2023-11-10 22:17:05,613 INFO: The software failure incident occurred over the last few weeks, impacting companies globally. The specific system that failed was the print servers, which were experiencing the issue of emptying paper trays by printing endless pages of meaningless characters. The cause of this failure was identified as a malware known as Trojan.Milicenso. This malware primarily targeted Windows-based computers and spread through malicious email attachments or visiting websites hosting malicious scripts.

The impact of this failure was twofold. Firstly, the intended purpose of the malware was to direct computers to pages with advertisements. However, as a side effect, it triggered massive print jobs, resulting in the garbled printouts. This suggests that the author of the malware did not specifically intend for the print server failure, but it was an unintended consequence. Additionally, this malware caused infections primarily in the United States and India, but also spread to other countries in Europe and South America.

The responsible entity for the malware was not explicitly mentioned in the given context. However, Symantec, a cybersecurity company, provided information about the malware and its impact. They conducted an investigation and shared their findings. Their telemetry data suggested that the United States and India were the hardest-hit regions.

The impacted entities were the companies and organizations that had print servers affected by this malware. These entities experienced the issue of paper trays being emptied by continuous printing of meaningless characters. This would have disrupted their printing operations and could have led to a waste of resources such as paper and ink.

In summary, the software failure incident involved print servers being affected by the Trojan.Milicenso malware, resulting in continuous printing of garbled characters. This occurred over the last few weeks and impacted companies globally. The cause of the failure was the malware, primarily targeting Windows-based computers through malicious email attachments or malicious scripts on websites. The impact included disruptions in printing operations and resource wastage. The responsible entity for the malware was not explicitly mentioned, but Symantec provided information and conducted an investigation on the incident. [13033]

2023-11-10 22:27:22,245 INFO: Based on the given context, it is difficult to determine a specific measure that could have prevented the software failure incident. However, some possible preventive measures could include:

1. Robust cybersecurity measures: Implementing strong antivirus and anti-malware software, regularly updating security patches, and conducting regular security audits can help prevent malware infections.

2. User education and awareness: Providing training and education to users about phishing attacks, malicious email attachments, and visiting suspicious websites can help them identify and avoid potential malware vectors.

3. Network segmentation: Implementing network segmentation can help contain the spread of malware within the network and limit its impact on critical systems.

4. Regular system updates: Keeping operating systems and software applications up to date with the latest security patches can minimize vulnerabilities that malware can exploit.

5. Email and web security measures: Implementing robust email filters to block suspicious email attachments and using web filtering tools to prevent users from accessing potentially malicious websites can reduce the risk of malware infections.

6. Backup and disaster recovery plans: Regularly backing up critical data and having a disaster recovery plan in place can help minimize the impact of a software failure incident by allowing for quick restoration of systems.

7. Incident response planning: Having an incident response plan in place can help organizations respond effectively to a software failure incident, minimizing its impact and facilitating a swift recovery.

It is important to note that the specific preventive measures will vary depending on the organization's infrastructure, security policies, and industry best practices. [13033]

2023-11-10 22:27:52,633 INFO: The software failure incident occurred on 2016-03-30. The system that failed was Apple's iOS on the iPhone and iPad, specifically the core system called Universal Links. The failure was caused by an error in the travel planning app Booking.com, which overloaded the Universal Links system. The impact of the failure was that links and web addresses did not work, and iPhones crashed. Thousands of Apple smartphone and tablet users were affected by this bug. The responsible entity for the failure was Apple, as the bug was caused by an error in the Booking.com app that overloaded Apple's core system. The impacted entities were the iPhone and iPad users who experienced the inability to use links and web addresses, as well as the crashing of their devices. Apple acknowledged the problem and stated that they would release a fix in a software update soon, but as of the incident's publication date, the fix had not been released yet. Enraged users blamed Apple and the recent iOS 9.3 update for the problem, with some experiencing terrible battery life and others finding their iPhones practically unusable. [41561]

2023-11-10 22:28:26,087 INFO: The software failure incident occurred after installing the OS X 10.7.5 update for Lion. The system that failed was Time Machine and Spotlight, which experienced slow running and updating of their indexes. This issue affected a number of users with various Mac models and backup setups, including local drives and Apple's Time Capsule devices.

The cause of the failure is believed to be a fault with the existing Spotlight index on the hard drive. Some users tried reverting to the previous OS version, 10.7.4, and noticed immediate improvement in the performance of Time Machine and Spotlight. This suggests that the issue lies specifically with the OS X 10.7.5 update.

The impact of the failure was that Time Machine backups took an extremely long time to complete, with backups running at only a few kilobytes per hour. Users reported that the backups would take anywhere from days to weeks to finish.

The responsible entity for this failure is Apple, as it is their OS X 10.7.5 update that caused the issue. The impacted entities are the users who installed the update and experienced the slow performance of Time Machine backups and Spotlight indexing.

To potentially resolve the issue, users were advised to remove the existing Spotlight index by running a command in the Terminal utility and then rebuild the index to see if it improves system response. The specific commands to remove and re-enable Spotlight indexing were provided in the context.

Overall, the software failure incident occurred after the installation of the OS X 10.7.5 update, resulting in slow performance of Time Machine backups and Spotlight indexing for affected users. Apple is the responsible entity, and the impacted entities are the users who installed the update. An existing fault with the Spotlight index is believed to be the cause of the failure. [15285]

2023-11-10 22:38:58,764 INFO: The software failure incident occurred after the release of Apple's latest operating software, iOS 9.3, and affected hundreds of iPhone and iPad users. Users of older devices such as iPhone 5S or earlier models and iPad Air and earlier models found that updating to iOS 9.3 would lock their devices in an unusable state if they couldn't remember their Apple ID password. 

The problem was isolated to the Booking.com app, which had a 2.3MB Universal Links file listing every link on the Booking.com site. The sheer size of the file, combined with issues within iOS's Shared Web Credentials system, caused iPhones and iPads to enter a crash loop, rendering them unresponsive and draining their batteries faster than normal.

Another bug, also related to Apple's Universal Links feature, was discovered, causing apps such as Mail, Messages, and Safari to crash when a link was tapped. This bug was not confined to iOS 9.3, but users complained in larger numbers after the update.

The impact of the software failure was that users experienced locked and unusable devices, as well as crashes and unresponsiveness when using certain apps. This had a significant negative impact on user experience, productivity, and device performance.

Apple acknowledged the problems and stated that a permanent fix would likely require an update to iOS. The responsible entity for the software failure incident was Apple, as it was their operating software that had the bugs.

2023-11-10 22:39:30,218 INFO: The software failure incident occurred on a sunny Saturday when the servers of the popular mobile game Pokemon Go crashed multiple times due to overwhelming demand. The cause of the failure was the unexpected and high volume of requests for information from users, which overwhelmed the servers. This incident resulted in frustrated fans taking to Twitter to express their disappointment and to document their inability to play the game. The impacted entity was the players who were unable to access and play the game. The responsible entity for the failure was Niantic, the company behind Pokemon Go. Niantic's servers were already vulnerable, and the incident highlighted this vulnerability. The impact of the failure was widespread frustration and disappointment among the game's user base, as documented on social media platforms. Niantic acknowledged the server issues on their Twitter account and assured users that they were working to resolve the problem. The incident occurred shortly after the game was launched in 26 new countries in Europe, indicating that the surge in new users may have contributed to the server crashes. [45689]

2023-11-10 22:50:03,450 INFO: Based on the given context, the software failure incident occurred in the 911 emergency system. The researchers at Ben Gurion University in Israel discovered a vulnerability in the system that could be exploited for Telephony Denial of Service (TDoS) attacks. The researchers shared their findings with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), who confirmed the accuracy of their characterization of the problem.

The vulnerability allowed attackers to flood the 911 system with a high volume of calls, overwhelming the call centers and routers that operate at near capacity under normal circumstances. The attackers used this method as part of an extortion plot, demanding money and launching the TDoS attacks when their demands were not met. As a result, the system was unable to receive legitimate calls during the attack.

The impact of the failure was significant, as it could cause up to 33 percent of legitimate callers to give up in reaching 911. This means that a significant number of people in need of emergency assistance would be unable to connect with the emergency services. The responsible entity for the failure was not explicitly mentioned in the given context, but the researchers at Ben Gurion University were responsible for identifying and reporting the vulnerability. The impacted entity was the 911 emergency system, which faced the risk of being overwhelmed by TDoS attacks, potentially endangering lives in emergency situations. [47969]

2023-11-10 23:00:40,549 INFO: The software failure incident occurred on November 11 at Lucky Supermarkets, a chain owned by Save Mart, in northern California and northern Nevada. During routine maintenance on a self-checkout machine, an employee discovered an extra computer board that had been placed inside the checkout machine, recording customers' financial information. This incident was caused by a fraudster who tampered with the credit and debit card readers at self-checkout lanes in more than 20 supermarkets operated by the California chain.

The impact of the software failure was significant. Lucky Supermarkets received over 1,000 calls from customers reporting that they had been victims of compromised machines. Additionally, there were approximately 80 reports of compromised account data from both employees and customers. Due to the severity of the situation, Lucky Supermarkets issued a consumer advisory, urging customers who used self-checkout lanes to close their bank and credit card accounts.

The responsible entity for the software failure incident was the fraudster who tampered with the credit and debit card readers. Lucky Supermarkets took immediate action, working with local, state, and federal law enforcement to find those responsible. They also launched an investigation into the incident and began inspecting the rest of their 234 stores in northern California and northern Nevada to ensure the safety of their customers' financial information.

In summary, the software failure incident occurred on November 11 at Lucky Supermarkets, caused by a fraudster tampering with the credit and debit card readers in self-checkout lanes. The impact of the failure included compromised customer account data and financial losses. Lucky Supermarkets took responsibility for the incident and worked with law enforcement agencies to find the perpetrators. Customers who used self-checkout lanes were advised to close their bank and credit card accounts for their own protection. [54621]

2023-11-10 23:11:15,468 INFO: Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of a software failure incident. The incident being described involves the failure of an armed drone, specifically an MQ-9 Reaper. The primary cause of the incident was the failure of the generator, which, along with the depleted backup batteries, led to the crash of the aircraft. It is stated that the decision to crash the aircraft was made due to a delay in uploading software for the launch and recovery element, as well as the decision to not lower the landing gear earlier. 

The impact of the failure resulted in the destruction of the MQ-9 Reaper, leading to a loss of $14.1 million. Thankfully, there were no injuries or damage to civilian property as a result of the crash. The responsible entity for the incident would be the Air Force, as they conducted the investigation and released the accident report. The impacted entity is the 432nd Attack Squadron at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota, as they were the crew responsible for flying the MQ-9 Reaper during the incident.

It is important to note that although the incident involved a drone, generator failure, depleted batteries, and decision-making factors, there is no explicit mention of a software failure. Therefore, the information provided does not allow for a comprehensive summary of a software failure incident. [39478]

2023-11-10 23:11:51,140 INFO: The software failure incident occurred with Google Flu Trends (GFT) in 2009. GFT is a system that uses big data to forecast flu trends. The failure was caused by the flawed methodology used in GFT, which involved finding matches among 50 million search terms to fit 1,152 data points. This led to the inclusion of unrelated search terms, resulting in inaccurate predictions. The failure was also attributed to changes made by Google to its search algorithm, as well as the introduction of the "autosuggest" feature in November 2009. 

The impact of the failure was significant, as GFT's inaccurate predictions and flawed methodology hindered scientific research and undermined its credibility. The broader lesson from this incident is the danger of "big data hubris," where organizations rely too heavily on flawed analyses without realizing their limitations.

The responsible entity for the failure is Google, as it made the changes to its search algorithm and introduced the "autosuggest" feature that affected GFT's performance. The impacted entity is the scientific community, as GFT's failure blocked scientific research and hindered the progress in flu trend forecasting. [25033]
