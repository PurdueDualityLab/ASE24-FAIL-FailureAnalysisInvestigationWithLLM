"British teen arrested in hacking of top U.S. intelligence officials"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/british-teen-arrested-in-hacking-of-top-us-intelligence-officials/2016/02/12/7b87351e-d1a5-11e5-b2bc-988409ee911b_story.html

The emails of the CIA director and the Director of National Intelligence
were the victims of email hacking, and a British teenager has been arrested
for it.  The investigation of the exploit has focused on "Crackas With
Attitude", and they are suspected of leaking government employee information
(see the preceding news item).

The exploit may have been "old school" because it is rumored to have been
based on convincing Verizon workers that they were talking to the victims.
The hackers got the account access information changed so that they could
login to the victims' email accounts.  They also claimed to have changed
voice forwarding on one of the phones.

  The Justice Department asked a judge on Monday to postpone a hearing
  scheduled for the next day about whether Apple should be compelled to help
  unlock an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.  The surprise
  last minute filing said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation would try
  to access the data stored on the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook through
  alternate means, without specifying exactly how. It raises the possibility
  of a truce between the federal government and Apple, which have waged a
  public war over the propriety of the company helping law enforcement
  access the data.

Subject: Canadian Implementation of Chip and Pin and NFC

In the US, some retailers do not ask for a signature if the purchase was
below some amount.  Before chip and pin in Canada, that was also sometimes
the case, especially in grocery stores and that was implemented by the card
company.

Chip and PIN credit and debit cards in Canada now include a tap facility and
while it physically is a chip in the card, the technology is NFC similar to
that used in smartphones and tablets rather than read only RFID so it is
supposed to be much more secure.
http://canada.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/contactless-payment-myths-1264.php

If you want to use the tap method and it has been implemented by the
retailer, you simply tap and hold the card against part of the retail
terminal. Again, this is usually done by grocery stores and Walmart.

This has also been implemented for bank/credit union debit cards where there
is a limit of a $100 per transaction and after every $200 of transactions,
you have to enter your PIN.

As alternative for the customer, or if it isn't implemented then the card
can be inserted in a slot in the terminal and you have to enter the PIN.

Paying at the gas pump is a bit weird. At some pumps you can tap the card.
Most haven't implemented this, so after swiping any loyalty card, you insert
your chip and pin card. The terminal locks your card and then you pick a
maximum authorization amount in $20 increments and enter the PIN.  Your card
is then released and you remove it and pump the gas.  This method ensures
you pay for the gas.

Crooks have found yet another way to steal your banking info. They can
hijack info via ethernet cable of a cash machine's phone or Internet jack,
to gather your card information.  This risk is probably on many devices
which accept our debit and credit cards.  Long before this is fixed, the
crooks will have found other exploits.

  If space was the final frontier for Captain Kirk and the Enterprise,
  digital-app experiences are the heavily explored frontier for a host of
  entities. Because apps are a key link between the public and a business,
  the accessibility of apps to individuals with disabilities, especially
  those individuals who are blind or have low vision, is unfortunately
  likely to become the newest contested cyber battleground for claims under
  the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and similar state and local
  laws.

Accessibility matters.

Subject: Fifth Amendment does not cover Domestic Staff, Human or Electronic

An interesting, yet not particularly well-explored question is "What happens
when your device knows EVERYTHING?"

The Electronic assistants inherently need to acquire a large volume of data
about their owners and connections. The problem is "What is the status of
that information?"

Those who viewed British historical drama Downton Abbey got a refresher on
how much information domestic staff see about their principals. It does not
matter if the domestic help is human or machine. The servant knows
everything. Domestic habits, social activities, travel, health data, dietary
data, and many other data items.

I wonder aloud whether we have the proper legal regime to manage and protect
this data from fishing expeditions. In the United States, a principal can
assert the 5th Amendment right not to testify against oneself. However, if
the personal electronic servant is in possession of the information, I
suspect that a simple subpoena or search warrant can obtain the information.

This a serious question which needs to be addressed at the soonest possible
opportunity.

The referenced Bloomberg article says: "Over Saturday and Sunday, Bangladesh
Bank failed to reach officials in New York by phone. But by that time it was
also a weekend in the U.S., and nobody was available."

Really? The Bangladesh Central Bank had $28 Billion on deposit with the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and didn't have 24x7 emergency contact
information? Or they couldn't reach the US Embassy to have someone call
them?

One can easily hypothesize why alternative means of contacting the NY Fed
weren't used, but "nobody was available" doesn't pass the laugh test.

Subject: Re: Ukraine Electric SANS Report (RISKS-29.37)

Earlier I wrote <http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/29.37.html#subj10> that I
was unable to locate the SANS / NERC E-ISAC lessons learned report, that the
Dark Reading article was about.
<http://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/lessons-from-the-ukraine-electric-grid-hack/d/d-id/1324743?_mc=RSS_DR_EDT>

Here it is (PDF 29 pages 1.8 Meg)
http://ics.sans.org/media/E-ISAC_SANS_Ukraine_DUC_5.pdf

It mentions claims in news stories about the incident, identifying areas
where some past articles were incorrect.

In addition to what I wrote in my prior post, based mainly on the Dark
Reading article:

* The attackers successfully used two different SCADA hijack across
  different types of SCADA/DMS implementations at the 3 companies. (DNS   distribution management systems.)

* This report supports the mitigation recommendations in the DHS ICS-CERT
  alert, but they go further with more.

The following is a consolidated list of technical components used by the
attackers, graphically depicted in Figure 3 (of this report):

* Spearphishing to gain access to the business networks of the oblenergos
  (the Ukraine electric companies);

* Identification of BlackEnergy 3 at each of the impacted oblenergos;

* Theft of credentials from the business networks;

* The use of virtual private networks (VPNs) to enter the ICS network;

* The use of existing remote access tools within the environment or issuing
  commands directly from a remote station similar to an operator HMI (Human
  Machine Interface);

* Serial-to-Ethernet communications devices impacted at a firmware level16;

* The use of a modified KillDisk to erase the master boot record of impacted
  organization systems as well as the targeted deletion of some logs;

* Utilizing UPS systems to impact connected load with a scheduled service
  outage;

* Telephone denial-of-service attack on the center;

Footnotes in the report include links to many sources which I had not
previously seen.

My guess is that the same was the case in the Ukraine incident.

Once you have control over a computer, you can log the keypresses. So
hackers wait and grab the password once it is entered.

This is why (imho) the "sudo" program asking for the user-password is not
really that useful. Once a hacker have access to the "uses-sudo-regularly"
useraccount, the hacker installs a front for "sudo" that asks for the
password, sends it home, tells the user the password was incorrect and then
executes the real sudo. (Sudo tries to interact with the real user, so
having the front pass the password to sudo should be impossible/difficult).

Anyway, once the hackers have control over a computer that uses the VPN,
they similarly lie in wait for the user to enter the credentials and grab
them while they are unencrypted.

Subject: Re: Pentagon skips tests on key component of U.S.-based missile
  (Baker, RISKS-29.37)

The torpedo problem was not made public during the war but was soon known
post war.

A torpedo shot apparently cost $10,000 versus the Air Force paying $129,000
for a DC-3 transport.  So extensive testing was costly.

There were actually three problems.  All of which began to be reported in
December 1941.  Code breaking supplied information as well.  Of course
individual commands did take action before the official system did.

Then comes using 16 torpedoes in a failed attempt to scuttle the dead in the
water aircraft carrier USS Hornet in October 1942, 5 inch guns had to be
used, the Japanese boarded the ship, then decided it was too far gone and
put two of their torpedoes into it.

1) The depth keeping system consistently made the torpedoes run deeper than
set.  Tests begun in South West Pacific Command in mid 1942 revealed the
average depth was 11 feet more than the settings.  This was confirmed in the
US in a series of tests ordered by Admiral King in July 1942, previous
reports had been rejected by the Ordnance Department.

2) The new magnetic exploder, issued late in 1941 under strict secrecy
rules, the people using the torpedoes found out about them after the war
started.  Testing consisted of firing dummy warheads at a cruiser in
equatorial waters.  No live tests were done.  The officer in charge of the
tests, Lieutenant Commander Ralph Christie did try for an old hulk to use
for for live tests but failed.  Later he commanded one of the US Submarine
bases against Japan and backed the exploder against the reports of the
captains.

The exploder often prematured.  On 24 June for the Pacific Fleet submarines
and 23 July 1943 for the destroyers came an official order to deactivate it.

3) The contact exploder, the pins were not strong enough, it meant an angled
hit exploded more often but a torpedo hitting at near right angles usually
did not.  So the best attacks had a higher failure rate.  In mid 1943 the
Pacific fleet tried two torpedoes against a cliff, one failed.  They then
went to dropping dummy warhead torpedoes from a 90 foot crane onto a steel
plate.  All right angle hits caused the pins to distort rather than cause
detonation, a 45 degree hit had the detonator working about half the time.

The immediate fix was to try and cut torpedo speed, plus look at captured
German torpedoes.  The German contact exploder at the start of the war also
had real problems, solved when they used the Royal Navy design.

In October 1943 the Pacific Fleet arranged for six torpedoes to be fired at
a cliff, hitting at right angles, all exploded.

Yes, many people, though they are of varying quality. Most are used out of
RFID paranoia rather than concerns about credit card fraud *per se*, but the
quality ones should work for either purpose.  A web search on "credit card
faraday cage" will provide any number of pointers, including the simple (but

		    Book Review By Richard Austin
                          3/17/2016

Craig Smith
The Car Hacker's Handbook: A Guide for the Penetration Tester
No Starch Press, 2016
ISBN 978-1-59327-703

A penetration test on your car?  Have we really gotten to the point where
even our cars have networks, multiple computers, panoplies of sensors and,
of course, software to make them all work together?  Smith assures us that
we have and then proceeds to walk us through a solid introduction to this
bizarre world and how things in it can be made to misbehave.

Smith opens the book with a welcome chapter on threat models which orients
the reader for the material that follows and how it might be applied by
security professionals.  Far too many books of this type open with a frantic
rush to get to the tools and leave the reader to contextualize and position
the material as best they can with the usual result of a vague impression of
a long list of tools and commands that all do something but really no idea
of how they might fit together into a whole.

The next three chapters introduce the important protocols, how communication
within the vehicle is done, and an introduction to the diagnostic and
logging data maintained by the vehicle (if you've ever had a "Check Engine"
light illuminate, you've seen the "user mode" interface to this data).

Chapter 5, "Reverse Engineering the CAN Bus", reflects the important point
that these are proprietary systems and manufacturers have little incentive
to disclose their details.  This leaves the security professional with the
task of capturing traffic, decoding it to form theories about what is
actually going on and then apply the theory to verify that it is somewhere
close to correct.  Smith demonstrates use of the tools with screenshots and
sample commands to get you started. He thoughtfully provides a
troubleshooting guide for when you accidentally put the vehicle into a state
where it no longer works correctly.

The next chapter, "ECU Hacking", describes how to interact with a vehicle's
ECU's (Electronic Control Units) in three ways: front door attacks using the
manufacturer's access mechanisms; backdoor attacks using the more or less
traditional hardware analysis techniques (dumping and disassembling
firmware, etc.); and exploits where you discover unintentional access
methods.

Chapter 7, "Building and Using ECU Test Benches", describes how to "run" an
ECU outside the vehicle so you can interact with it in isolation from the
rest of the vehicle.  Smith also covers the important topic of how to
simulate the sensor signals the ECU is expecting to process.  Working with
the EXU outside the vehicle reduces the noise introduced by other units and
also reduces the consequences of an "Oops!".

The next chapter, "Attacking ECUS And Other Embedded Systems", gets to the
meat of the matter in interacting with these devices.  This is an excellent
chapter that introduces a plethora of tools and hardware accessories in a
single place without having to scour multiple websites and online forums.
Some of the techniques (e.g., JTAG) will be familiar if you've done hardware
debugging but Smith's additional discussion of how these tools can be used
to change the desired operation of embedded systems in ways an adversary
might desire is both eye opening and invaluable.

Chapter 9, "In-Vehicle Infotainment Systems", extends the discussion to that
nice touchscreen found in many vehicles that is the interface to multiple
applications such as navigation and climate control.

The next chapter, "Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication", provides an
introduction to one of the more frightening possibilities in vehicle
systems: cross-communication.  Though it might be useful for a truck loaded
with dynamite to notify vehicles in its vicinity that it's transporting
hazardous material, the potential mischief of false notifications or
suppressed notifications is obvious.  This is a developing technology and
could well use input from the security profession.  Chapter 11, "Weaponizing
CAN Findings", describes how to "take an exploit and make it easy to use"
(p. 193).  Smith lucidly demonstrates how to take an exploit (found during
your research using the techniques described in the earlier chapters) and
package it as a Metasploit payload (it doesn't get much easier to use than
this).

The next chapter, "Attacking Wireless Systems with SDR", describes how to
use inexpensive Software Defined Radio (SDR) equipment to interact with
vehicle systems using wireless technology.  While wide coverage radio
transceivers may cost several thousands of dollars, a SDR costs typically
less that $500 (SDR receivers can be found as cheaply as $30).  The systems
used as examples are the TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) and key fobs
(more interesting because they use cryptography).  Smith begins with a
discussion of modulation, how information is imposed onto a radio signal,
and moves on to receiving the signals and interpreting them.  Once you know
the frequency, modulation and the format of the information itself, you are
in a position to generate your own signals to trigger the desired action.

Chapter 13, "Performance Tuning", describes a well-developed, application
for modifying the operating parameters of vehicle systems to improve
performance.  This is a masterful demonstration that these are not abstract
possibilities but, at least in their more benign applications, already
well-developed.

Our world is rapidly being filled with things that are computers and
communication networks but don't look like them.  And, like any other
complex system, they expose vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a
malicious adversary.  The consequences of suddenly killing the engines of
several vehicles surrounding a truck carrying hazardous materials on a busy
interstate highway are horrifying to contemplate.

Smith has done a marvelous job of providing a practical introduction to the
world of vehicle systems and the tools used to interact with them for both
benign and malicious purposes.  The challenge for the security profession is
to engage with the engineers designing these systems to build understanding
of the security implications of design and implementation decisions.  With
Smith's introduction under our belt, we will be much better prepared to
speak their language.  Definitely a recommended read.
