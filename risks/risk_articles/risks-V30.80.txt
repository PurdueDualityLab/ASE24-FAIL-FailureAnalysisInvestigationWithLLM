Subject: BlockChain Security

The ISC2 "community" has had a bunch of queries about blockchain in recent
months.  One person started a fairly active thread asking for a kind of a
cheat sheet for blockchain security.

The real issue is that, however it started out, blockchain has now become
kind of a marketing term: it means whatever the vendor selling it to you
thinks it means.  (Which is not necessarily what you need it to mean.)
Essentially, by now it's pretty meaningless.

At base, it is an amalgamation of two ideas.  Digital signing of
transactions, and a distributed database of those transactions and
signatures.

Beyond that, we have implementation details.  And those, as always, are
where the problems arise.

Are you really serious about the signatures?  Are you doing confidentiality,
or just the authentication?  How serious is your signature algorithm?  What
about key management?  Have you got all the bits you need for a full PKI?
Are you using a hierarchical model or web of trust?

And these are only the beginning of the questions.  On the signature side.

How are you going to distribute the transaction ledger?  Is it going to be
full everywhere?  Is it going to be full *any*where?  How can it be accessed
and checked?  Will a complete examination of the register identify an
individual even if a single transaction doesn't?

So, ultimately, the answer to your question is "no."  There isn't any
nugget.  There isn't any cheat sheet.  The hygiene depends upon what you
build or buy.

And that's why BLOCKCHAIN IS NOT THE ANSWER.

(Blockchain isn't even the question.  Even if the answer *is* "no.")

(Sorry.  As the dictionary guy I always get kind of bitter when a term that
*might* have had a meaning or use gets abused to the point of being
meaningless ...)

Subject: Can hackers tamper with your vote? Researchers show it's possible

  [Note:  This item comes from reader Randall Head.  DLH]

Tim Johnson, Greg Gordon and Christine Condon, McClatchy, 14 Aug 2018
Can hackers tamper with your vote? Researchers show it's possible in nearly
30 states

http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/

Las Vegas -- Top computer researchers gave a startling presentation recently
about how to intercept and switch votes on emailed ballots, but officials in
the 30 or so states said the ease with which votes could be changed wouldn't
alter their plans to continue offering electronic voting in some fashion.

Two states -- Washington and Alaska -- have ended their statewide online
voting systems.

The developments, amid mounting fears that Russians or others will try to
hack the 2018 midterm elections, could heighten pressure on officials on
other U.S. states to reconsider their commitment to online voting despite
repeated admonitions from cybersecurity experts.

But a McClatchy survey of election officials in a number of states that
permit military and overseas voters to send in ballots by email or fax --
including Alabama, Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina and
Texas -- produced no immediate signs that any will budge on the issue. Some
chief election officers are handcuffed from making changes, even in the
name of security, by state laws permitting email and fax voting.

At the world's largest and longest-running hacker convention, two
researchers from a Portland, Ore., nonpartisan group that studies election
security showed how, in about two hours, they could set up a sham server
and program it to intercept and alter ballots attached to emails.

``Ballots sent over email are not secure,'' said Lyell Read, one of the
researchers from the group Free and Fair. ``As long as people have a chance
to vote another way, that's probably a good decision.''

Read and Daniel M. Zimmerman, who earned credentials as a computer
scientist at CalTech, said the hacking at the annual DefCon conference in
Las Vegas required nothing more than commonly available programming tools.

Read said he set up an `impostor server' to mimic a real one that would
normally route emails containing attached ballots. On the rogue server, he
inserted 30 or so lines of computer code, known as Bash shell script, to
alter voters' choices on ballots attached to emails in transit and to
replace them with Read's preferred candidates.

Among those attending the conference were more than 20 officials from the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Several of them observed the email
vote switcheroo, said a department official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.

DHS officials have stepped up their consultations with states about election
security since Russian operatives hacked a voting vendor in 2016 and tried
through so-called spearphishing attacks to penetrate 21 state voter
registration systems, succeeding only in Illinois. The agency rarely
discusses its advice to state and local officials, whom the Constitution
gives nearly total authority over the nation's elections.

What does your state allow? [...]

In May, the Justice Department told Americans to reboot their routers.  But

LAS VEGAS -- The Russian military is inside hundreds of thousands of routers
owned by Americans and others around the world, a top U.S.  cybersecurity
official said on Friday. The presence of Russian malware on the routers,
first revealed in May, could enable the Kremlin to steal individuals'

global economic activity or target institutions.

On May 27, Justice Department officials asked Americans to reboot their
routers

Security Agency and the former White House cybersecurity coordinator.

``The Russian malware is still there,'' said Joyce.

Subject: How China Found CIA Spies Leak (David Choi)

The CIA falsely believed it was `invincible' in China -- here's how its
spies were reportedly discovered in one of the biggest blows to the agency.

Business Insider via https://apple.news/AHrCHw8PmRPOQPezQrOSmhg

A new Foreign Policy report cites sources detailing how the communication
system between the CIA's spies and handlers in China nearly a decade ago was
compromised.  The vulnerability contributed to the deaths of at least 30
spies, the sources said.  This internet-based system, imported from
operations in the Middle East, was apparently brought to China under the
assumption that it could not be breached.  But, according to the report, the
program actually had telltale links to the CIA that would have allowed China
to work out what was going on.  A firewall used by the CIA to communicate
with its spies in China compromised their identities and contributed to
their executions by the Chinese government, several current and former
intelligence officials told Foreign Policy magazine in a report published
Wednesday.

In a two-year period starting in 2010, Chinese officials began accurately
identifying spies working for the US.  Chinese authorities rounded up the
suspects and executed or imprisoned them before their handlers were able to
determine what was going on.  "You could tell the Chinese weren't guessing,"
one of the US officials said in the report. "The Ministry of State Security
were always pulling in the right people."  "When things started going bad,
they went bad fast."

US intelligence officials cited in the report are now placing the lion's
share of the blame on what one official called a "f----- up" communications
system used between spies and their handlers.

This Internet-based system, brought over from operations in the Middle East,
was taken to China under the assumption that it could not be breached and
made the CIA "invincible," Foreign Policy reported.  "It migrated to
countries with sophisticated counterintelligence operations, like China," an
official said.  "The attitude was that we've got this, we're untouchable."

Intelligence officers and their sources were able to communicate with each
other using ordinary laptops or desktop computers connected to the Internet,
marking a stark departure from some of the more traditional methods of
covert communication.

Subject: A New Pacemaker Hack Puts Malware Directly On the Device (WiReD)

The first pacemaker hacks emerged about a decade ago. But the latest
variation on the terrifying theme depends not on manipulating radio
commands, as many previous attacks have, but on malware installed directly
on an implanted pacemaker.

For nearly two years, researchers Billy Rios of the security firm Whitescope
and Jonathan Butts of QED Secure Solutions have gone back and forth with
pacemaker manufacturer Medtronic, which makes Carelink 2090 pacemaker
programmers and other relevant equipment that the researchers say contain
potentially life-threatening vulnerabilities. The Department of Homeland
Security and the Food and Drug Administration have gotten involved as well.
And while Medtronic has remediated some of the issues the researchers
discovered, Rios and Butts say that too much remains unresolved, and that
the risk remains very real for pacemaker patients.  The pair will walk
through their findings Thursday at the Black Hat security conference.

With so many known vulnerabilities, and continually new ones being

more than at the beginning of 2018.

Here's a really nasty family of new attacks.  They extend an international

vulnerabilities in SGX, which are being called Foreshadow-NG.  The new paper

Why do we even bother encrypting, when our chips are so corrupt?

I believe that these VIA chips ended up in some military hardware, and
possibly in some ATM machines.

This article strengthens my belief that *all* of our current chips have
hidden backdoors thanks to Uncle Sam.  No wonder China wants to design &

Hacker Finds Hidden 'God Mode' on Old x86 CPUs

LAS VEGAS -- Some x86 CPUs have hidden backdoors that let you seize root by
sending a command to an undocumented RISC core that manages the main CPU,
security researcher Christopher Domas told the Black Hat conference here
Thursday (Aug. 9).

The command -- ".byte 0x0f, 0x3f" in Linux -- "isn't supposed to exist,
doesn't have a name, and gives you root right away," Domas said, adding that
he calls it "God Mode."  The backdoor completely breaks the protection-ring
model of operating-system security, in which the OS kernel runs in ring 0,
device drivers run in rings 1 and 2, and user applications and interfaces
("userland") run in ring 3, furthest from the kernel and with the least
privileges. To put it simply, Domas' God Mode takes you from the outermost
to the innermost ring in four bytes.  "We have direct ring 3 to ring 0
hardware privilege escalation," Domas said. "This has never been done."

That's because of the hidden RISC chip, which lives so far down on the bare
metal that Domas half-joked that it ought to be thought of as a new, deeper
ring of privilege, following the theory that hypervisors and chip-management
systems can be considered ring -1 or ring -2.  "This is really ring -4," he
said. "It's a secret, co-located core buried alongside the x86 chip. It has
unrestricted access to the x86."

The good news is that, as far as Domas knows, this backdoor exists only on
VIA C3 Nehemiah chips made in 2003 and used in embedded systems and thin
clients. The bad news is that it's entirely possible that such hidden
backdoors exist on many other chipsets.  "These black boxes that we're
trusting are things that we have no way to look into," he said. "These
backdoors probably exist elsewhere."

Domas discovered the backdoor, which exists on VIA C3 Nehemiah chips made in
2003, by combing through filed patents. He found one -- US8341419 -- that
mentioned jumping from ring 3 to ring 0 and protecting the machine from
exploits of model-specific registers (MSRs), manufacturer-created commands
that are often limited to certain chipsets.  Domas followed the "trail of
breadcrumbs," as he put it, from one patent to another and figured out that
certain VIA chipsets were covered by the patents. Then he collected many old
VIA C3 machines and spent weeks fuzzing code.

He even built a testing rig consisting of seven Nehemiah-based thin clients
hooked up to a power relay that would power-cycle the machines every couple
of minutes, because his fuzzing attempts would usually crash the
systems. After three weeks, he had 15 GB of log data -- and the instructions
to flip on the backdoor in the hidden RISC chip.  "Fortunately, we still
need ring 0 access to start the launch process, right?" Domas
asked. "No. Some of the VIA C3 x86 processors have God Mode enabled by
default. You can reach it from userland. Antivirus software, ASLR and all
the other security mitigations are useless."

Domas has put all his research up on his GitHub page, including tools to
check whether your VIA C3 CPU might have an undocumented coprocessor and to
disable the coprocessor by default:

probably pick a carrier more out of expediency than economy.

Now multiple this by two factors: first, you want to get business insurance,
and then you want to get business cyber insurance. If you are a big company,
you probably have specialists that can handle these tasks -- maybe. The
problem is that insurance specialists don't necessarily understand the
inherent cyber risks, and IT folks don't know how to talk to the insurance
pros. And to make matters more complex, the risks are evolving quickly as
criminals get better at plying their trade.

My first job was working after college in a key punch department of a large
insurance company in NYC. We filled out forms for the keypunch operators to
cut the cards that were used to program our mainframe computers. It was
strictly a clerical position, and it motivated me to go back and get a
graduate degree. I had no idea what the larger context of the company was,
or anything really about insurance. I was just writing numbers on a pad of
paper.

Years later, I worked in the nascent IT department of another large
insurance company in downtown LA. This was back in the mid 1980s. We didn't
know from cyber insurance back then: indeed, we didn't even have many PCs in
the building. At least not when I started: my job was to join an end-user
support department that was bringing in PCs by the truckload.

So those days are thankfully behind me, and behind most of us too. Cyber
insurance is becoming a bigger market, mainly because companies want to
protect themselves against any financial losses that stem from hacking or
data leaks. So far, this kind of insurance has been met with mixed
success. Here is one recent story about a Virginia bank that was hit with
two different attacks
<http://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/hackers-breached-virginia-bank-twice-in-eight-months-stole-2-4m/>
They had cyber insurance, and filed a claim, and ended up in a court battle
with their insurer who (surprise!) didn't want to pay out, claiming some
fine print on the policy.

Sadly, that is where things stand for the present day. Cyber insurance is
still a very immature market, and there are many insurers who frankly
shouldn't be writing policies because they don't know what they are doing,
what the potential risks are, and how to evaluate their customers. If you
live in a neighborhood with a high rate of car thefts, your auto premiums
are going to be higher than a safer neighborhood. But there is no single
metric -- or even a set of metrics -- that can be used to evaluate the cyber
risk context.

I talk about these and other issues with two cyber insurance gurus on David
Senf's 40 min. podcast *Threat Actions This Week* here

Over the last eight months a wide range of patent applications

covering autonomous vehicles have come to light, with many of them
discovered in Europe. In that time frame we also learned that Apple is

on an autonomous vehicle. Earlier today Patently Apple discovered yet
another European Patent application from Apple that was published on
Wednesday August 1, 2018.

The detailed patent covers a future augmented reality windshield system
which also is known as a Heads up Display. Apple describes every aspect of
their AR display system in painstaking detail. It even describes occupants
of an autonomous vehicle having a FaceTime session between different
vehicles. The system will even be able to detect and make adjustments so
that a panicky occupant could remain calmer in the autonomous vehicle.

  (The Verge)

SIM card hacking ring, the latest in a series of similar incidents.

According to court records first unearthed this week by reporter Brian
Krebs, law enforcement learned of the plot when a mother in Michigan
overheard her son pretending to be an AT&T employee and called
investigators. Authorities turned up, searched the son's room and
his computer, and discovered files with a list of names and phone numbers,
along with SIM cards and cell phones.

After more searching, officers say they discovered SIM cards that led to
seven victims in seven states, and who said their identities were stolen and
cryptocurrency accounts pilfered of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Officers interviewed the son, who allegedly said about eight others,
including a man named Ricky Handschumacher, were involved.  According to the
officers' account, Handschumacher discussed the fraud scheme in Discord
conversations.

  (The Guardian)

http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/15/parents-fixated-by-phones-linked-to-child-drownings-in-germany

  German lifeguards have issued a warning that a growing number of child
  drownings this summer are linked to their parents' obsession
  with mobile phones.

  More than 300 people have drowned in Germany this year, with hardly a day
  passing during the current heatwave when a swimmer has not died.

  The German Lifeguard Association (DLRG) -- the biggest organisation of its
  kind in the world, providing 40,000 volunteer lifeguards at German
  beaches, lakes and the coast -- has made a direct connection between
  children getting into difficulty in the water and parents being too busy
  on their mobile phones to notice.

  ``Too few parents and grandparents are heeding the advice: when
  your children and grandchildren are in the water, put your smartphone
  away,'' Achim Wiese, the DLRG's spokesman, said.

WPA2 has given us 14 years of secure wireless networking. WPA3 will fix a
number of big problems in WPA2 and make strong security the default
condition.

Wi-Fi Protected Access II, or WPA2, is the standard behind wireless security
networking. It protects users everywhere, from coffee shops to college
campuses to corporate headquarters. WPA2 may be the most widespread security
standard in the world that ordinary people encounter.

With all that's gone on since 2004, when the specification behind WPA2 was
adopted, it must be considered a successful standard. But WPA2 does have
some important limitations. A new version, WPA3, is a significant
improvement. Products to use it are being built now, and certification for
them will begin in the third quarter of 2018.

Some services on Android and iPhone automatically stores your movements even

http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/google-location-tracking-android-iphone-mobile

selected text:

Google wants to know where you go so badly that it records your movements
even when you explicitly tell it not to.

For the most part, Google is upfront about asking permission to use your
location information. An app like Google Maps will remind you to allow
access to location if you use it for navigating. If you agree to let it
record your location over time, Google Maps will display that history for
you in a "timeline" that maps out your daily movements.

Storing your minute-by-minute travels carries privacy risks and has been
used by police to determine the location of suspects. So the company will
let you "pause" a setting called "location history".

Google says that will prevent the company from remembering where you've
been. Google's support page on the subject states: "You can turn off
Location History at any time. With Location History off, the places you go
are no longer stored."

That isn't true. Even with "location history" paused, some Google apps
automatically store time-stamped location data without asking.

Apple's supply chain is one of the most closely monitored and analyzed in
the world, both because of the control the company exerts and keen interest
from third parties. But there's still never a guarantee that a mass-produced
product will come out of the box totally pristine. In fact, it's possible to
remotely compromise a brand new Mac time it connects to Wi-Fi.

That attack, which researchers will demonstrate Thursday at the Black Hat
security conference in Las Vegas, targets enterprise Macs that use Apple's
Device Enrollment Program and its Mobile Device Management platform. These
enterprise tools allow employees of a company to walk through the customized
IT setup of a Mac themselves, even if they work in a satellite office or
from home. The idea is that a company can ship Macs to its workers directly
from Apple's warehouses, and the devices will automatically configure to
join their corporate ecosystem after booting up for the first time and
connecting to Wi-Fi.
