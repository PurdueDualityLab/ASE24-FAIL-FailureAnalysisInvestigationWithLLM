  (The Japan Times)

https://cdn-japantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/np_file_79612.jpeg

The Japan Times, 4 Apr 2021 (Bloomberg)

Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. has found that cosmic rays are causing
an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 temporary malfunctions in domestic network
communication devices in Japan every year. 9BLOOMBERG)

Most so-called soft errors, or temporary malfunctions, in the firm's
hardware are automatically corrected via safety devices, but experts said in
some cases they may have led to disruptions.

It is the first time the actual scale of soft errors in domestic information
infrastructures has become evident.

Soft errors occur when the data in an electronic device is corrupted after
neutrons, produced when cosmic rays hit oxygen and nitrogen in the Earth's
atmosphere, collide with the semiconductors within the equipment.

Cases of soft errors have increased as electronic devices with small and
high-performance semiconductors have become more common. Temporary
malfunctions have sometimes led to computers and phones freezing, and have
been regarded as the cause of some plane accidents abroad.

Masanori Hashimoto, professor at Osaka University's Graduate School of
Information Science and Technology and an expert in soft errors, said the
malfunctions have actually affected other network communication devices and
electrical machinery at factories worldwide.

There is a chance that `greater issues' will arise as society's
infrastructure becomes `more reliant on electronic devices' that use such
technologies as artificial intelligence and automated driving, Hashimoto
said.

He emphasized the need for the government and businesses to further research
and implement countermeasures.

However, identifying the cause of soft errors and implementing measures
against them can be difficult due to them not being reproducible in trials,
unlike mechanical failures.

NTT therefore measured the frequency of soft errors through an experiment
whereby semiconductors are exposed to neutrons, and concluded there are
about 100 errors per day in its domestic servers.

Although NTT did not reveal if network communication disruptions have
actually occurred, the company said it was ``implementing measures against
major issues'' and ``confirming the quality of the safety devices and
equipment design through experiments and presumptions.''

Subject: Windows, Ubuntu, Zoom, Safari, MS Exchange Hacked at Pwn2Own 2021
  (Zero Day Initiative)

The 2021 spring edition of *Pwn2Own*
<https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2021/4/2/pwn2own-2021-schedule-and-live-results>
hacking contest concluded last week on April 8 with a three-way tie between
Team Devcore, OV, and Computest researchers Daan Keuper and Thijs Alkemade.

A total of $1.2 million was awarded for 16 high-profile exploits over the
course of the three-day virtual event organized by the Zero Day Initiative
(ZDI).

Targets with successful attempts included Zoom, Apple Safari, Microsoft
Exchange, Microsoft Teams, Parallels Desktop, Windows 10, and Ubuntu Desktop
operating systems.

Some of the major highlights are as follows:

 - Using an authentication bypass and a local privilege escalation to
   completely take over a Microsoft Exchange server, for which the Devcore
   team netted $200,000
 - Chaining a pair of bugs to achieve code execution in Microsoft Teams,
   earning researcher OV $200,000
 - A zero-click exploit targeting Zoom that employed a three-bug chain to
   exploit the messenger app and gain code execution on the target system.
   ($200,000)
 - The exploitation of an integer overflow flaw in Safari and an
   out-of-bounds write to get kernel-level code execution ($100,000)
 - An exploit aimed at the Chrome renderer to hack Google Chrome and
   Microsoft Edge (Chromium) browsers ($100,000)
 - Leveraging *use-after-free*
   <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html>, race condition, and
   integer overflow bugs in Windows 10 to escalate from a regular user to
   SYSTEM privileges ($40,000 each)
 - Combining three flaws -- an uninitialized memory leak, a stack
   overflow, and an integer overflow -- to escape Parallels Desktop
   and execute code on the underlying operating system ($40,000)
 - Exploiting a memory corruption bug to successfully execute code on the
   host operating system from within Parallels Desktop ($40,000)
 - The exploitation of out-of-bounds access bug to elevate from a
   standard user to root on Ubuntu Desktop ($30,000)

The *Zoom vulnerabilities*
<https://twitter.com/thezdi/status/1379855435730149378> exploited by Daan
Keuper and Thijs Alkemade of Computest Security are particularly noteworthy
because the flaws require no interaction of the victim other than being a
participant on a Zoom call. What's more, it affects both Windows and Mac
versions of the app, although it's not clear if Android and iOS versions are
vulnerable as well.  [...]

Subject: Millions of Devices at Risk From NAME:WRECK DNS Bugs (Alex Scroxton)

Alex Scroxton, *Computer Weekly*, 13 Apr 2021 via ACM TechNews, 14 Apr 2021

Researchers at cybersecurity provider Forescout Research Labs and Israeli
cybersecurity consultancy JSOF discovered nine new Domain Name System (DNS)
vulnerabilities that could imperil more than 100 million connected Internet
of Things (IoT) devices, at least a third of them located in the UK.
Collectively designated NAME:WRECK, the bugs affect four popular
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) stacks: FreeBSD,
IPnet, Nucleus NET, and NetX. Malefactors who exploit the vulnerabilities in
a denial of service or remote code execution attack could disrupt or hijack
targeted networks. Forescout's Daniel dos Santos said, "Complete protection
against NAME:WRECK requires patching devices running the vulnerable versions
of the IP stacks, and so we encourage all organizations to make sure they
have the most up-to-date patches for any devices running across these
affected IP stacks."

Subject: Remote exploitation of a man-in-the-disk vulnerability in WhatsApp
  (CVE-2021-24027)

CENSUS has been investigating for some time now the exploitation potential
of Man-in-the-Disk (MitD) [01] vulnerabilities in Android. Recently, CENSUS
identified two such vulnerabilities in the popular WhatsApp messenger app
for Android [34]. The first of these was possibly independently reported to
Facebook and was found to be patched in recent versions, while the second
one was communicated by CENSUS to Facebook and was tracked as CVE-2021-24027
[33]. As both vulnerabilities have now been patched, we would like to share
our discoveries regarding the exploitation potential of such vulnerabilities
with the rest of the community.

In this article we will have a look at how a simple phishing attack through
an Android messaging application could result in the direct leakage of data
found in External Storage (/sdcard). Then we will show how the two
aforementioned WhatsApp vulnerabilities would have made it possible for
attackers to remotely collect TLS cryptographic material for TLS 1.3 and TLS
1.2 sessions. With the TLS secrets at hand, we will demonstrate how a
man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack can lead to the compromise of WhatsApp
communications, to remote code execution on the victim device and to the
extraction of Noise [05] protocol keys used for end-to-end encryption in
user communications.

Android 10 introduced the scoped storage feature [13], as a proactive
defense against these types of attacks. With scoped storage, apps get by
default access only to their own content on External Storage. Apps bearing
a certain permission [36] can also access content shared by other
applications. Finally, full access to External Storage is only granted to
special purpose apps (e.g. file managers) that have been audited by Google.
Android 11 is the first version to fully enforce the scoped storage rules
on all apps, while Android 10 included a permissive mode of operation to
provide developers with the needed time to transition to the new file
access scheme.

The techniques presented in this article apply to mobile devices running
Android versions up to and including Android 9. It is possible to perform
similar attacks using file-based access in Android 10, but we have not
included these for reasons of brevity. Even without Android 10 in the
picture, the number of affected devices remains quite large. Appbrain
statistics [35] hint that devices running Android up to and including
version 9 may very well constitute a 60% of all devices running Android
today.  [...]

   U.S. justices ask (Reuters)

Two U.S. Supreme Court justices from opposite ends of the ideological

risk lasting damage to the nation's democratic system.

Speaking in a pre-recorded discussion released on Wednesday, liberal Justice
Sonia Sotomayor and conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch both bemoaned the

The United States in the past year has endured a contentious presidential
campaign, former President Donald Trump's false claims of a stolen
election, an attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob and police
incidents that triggered protests against racial injustice.

``We have a ... very heated debate going on. And that's not necessarily a
bad thing, but it can turn into an awful thing, into something that destroys
the fabric of our community, if we don't learn to talk to each other,''
Sotomayor said.  [...]

Subject: NYPD's Robot Dog Returns to Work, Touching Off a Backlash
  (NYTimes)

Deployed at a public housing building, the device drew condemnation as a
stark example of police power and misplaced priorities.

A group of police officers marched out of a public housing building in
Manhattan on Monday with a man who they said had a gun and had been hiding
in an apartment with a woman and her baby.

But it was what came out of the building next that really grabbed attention
while feeding into a far-reaching debate about policing in New York: a
70-pound robotic dog outfitted with lights, cameras and artificial
intelligence.

The four-legged device had only gone into and out of the building's lobby
without playing an active role in the operation, the police said.  Still,
its mere presence at a public housing building ignited a fierce backlash,
with many people condemning it as a stark example of police power and
misplaced priorities even as calls to address both roil the United States.

“You can't give me a living wage, you can't raise a minimum wage, you can't
give me affordable housing; I'm working hard and I can't get paid leave, I
can't get affordable child care,” Representative Jamaal Bowman, a first-term
Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Westchester County, said in a
video posted on Twitter. “Instead we got money, taxpayer money, going to
robot dogs?”  [...]

After the New York police deployed their dog during a hostage situation in
the Bronx in February, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat
who represents parts of the borough and Queens, likened the Digidog on
Twitter to a `robotic surveillance ground' drone.  [...]

In response to questions about the robotic dog, the Police Department on
Wednesday referred to a February tweet that said New York officers had been
using robots for 50 years in hostage situations and hazardous material
settings where humans could be in danger.  [...]

“We're powerless,” she said. “We're like the scapegoats in society. To
further read that they are trying it out and testing it out on us --
everything that happens bad in our community happens here first.”

"The Pentagon is trying to find out how industry does it. The department is
writing into the contracts it signs with chip designers and foundries a
requirement to provide access to corporate data on assessing chip
reliability, according to Brett Hamilton, deputy principal director of the
Pentagon's microelectronics office, which is part of the office of the
undersecretary for research and engineering."

Enhanced corporate transparency -- disclosure of microelectronic design,
test, manufacturing data (test plans, results, design reviews, internal
discussions) can reveal issues affecting intellectual property
design/publication viability and/or manufactured product reliability.

Over-the-shoulder inspection of commercial operations assumes the looker
possesses the subject matter to intelligently assess the content for
engineering merit and risk.

When an unaddressed issue materializes in a supplier's product (e.g., a
design defect), what action should the product designer or manufacturer, or
customer, undertake to mitigate it? Who should pay for the mitigation?

Subject: 'Miss'taken assumptions lead to plane incident (The Guardian)

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/09/tui-plane-serious-incident-every-miss-on-board-child-weight-birmingham-majorca

  An update to the airline's reservation system while its planes were
  grounded due to the coronavirus pandemic led to 38 passengers on the
  flight being allocated a child's "standard weight" of 35kg as opposed to
  the adult figure of 69kg.

  This caused the load sheet -- produced for the captain to calculate what
  inputs are needed for take-off -- to state that the Boeing 737 was more
  than 1,200kg lighter than it actually was.

  Investigators described the glitch as "a simple flaw" in an IT system.  It
  was programmed in an unnamed foreign country where the title "Miss" is
  used for a child and "Ms" for an adult female.

The fix is apparently somewhat flawed:

  The operator subsequently introduced manual checks to ensure adult females
  were referred to as `Ms' on relevant documentation.

Risk is bad heuristics instead of asking for needed information ("adult or
child?") from the customers.

Subject: Coinbase Makes Its Debut -- and Bitcoin Arrives on Wall Street
  (WiReD)

All of this means that Coinbase's listing is a little like bitcoin's stock
market debut, too. Which is weird, when you think about where bitcoin
started. In his 2019 book, Narrative Economics, the Nobel Prize-winning
economist Robert Shiller describes the rise of bitcoin as a feat of
storytelling. There was the benefit of being the first, he writes, and in
the technology's unique independence from authority, which the story held
made it a hedge against government collapse and inflation. Others, including
Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal, have gone so far as to call bitcoin a
“faith-based” asset. Faith as in religion. It started with its pseudonymous
prophet, Satoshi Nakamoto, who compiled the code and vanished. It has code
words, a sacred white paper, a ritualistic schedule for `halving' the
creations of new blocks on the chain. Yes, all assets require faith. But
faith in the dollar is not faith in a physical paper or a coin, it's in the
US government. With bitcoin, the faith is in the thing itself, the network
that generates the coins and keeps them secure.

The conviction of bitcoin's adherents is important, given the lack of
earthly evidence for its value. Bitcoin is scarce, sure, because the code
ensures only 21 million bitcoins will ever be created. But that doesn't make
it an investible asset on its own. There are limited use cases. Bitcoin
can't be spent efficiently, much as people are trying to make that
happen. The network in which people place their faith is still somewhat
immature, leading to fears that the bitcoin market could be subject to
manipulation.

The masses have not been resoundingly faithful to this movement. The
mathematical epidemiologist Adam Kucharski, known for his work explaining
the transmission of diseases like Covid-19, writes about bitcoin as a form
of contagion spread through word of mouth and media mentions. But in network
terms, the series of booms and busts reveals a *disconnected* contagion --
an epidemic that flares up but doesn't spread too far. During a frenzy lots
of people jump in, and the value rises, for a while, but the overall impact
is limited. Recent surveys suggest that fewer than 10 percent of Americans
have dabbled in cryptocurrency.  About half of those people said they have
regrets.

'"NHTSA's general and voluntary guidance of emerging and evolutionary
technological advancements shows a willingness to let manufacturers and
operational entities define safety. We urge NHTSA to lead with detailed
guidance and specific standards and requirements," the letter states."'

DV industry self-regulation is a good idea, but organizational overreach
introduces significant public health and safety risks that can render
spectacular failures (e.g. Boeing 737-MAX). Public embrace of DV fleets
summoned from handheld hailing apps will not materialize without widespread
consumer trust.

Brands earn trust from marketplace performance history (Alka Seltzer,
anyone?), often a decades-long endeavor consisting of public trial and
error, and sometimes spectacular failures that sadly teach and refine
regulations affecting product design, engineering and manufacturing.  These
incidents comprise the technological equivalent of Niles Eldredge and
Stephen J. Gould's punctuated evolution.

"One of the NTSB's concerns is the testing of potential autonomous-driving
technology on public roads without any sort of standard methodology for
NHTSA to track vehicle data. In June 2020, the Department of Transportation
(DOT) announced a voluntary Automated Vehicle Transparency and Engagement
for Safe Testing (AV TEST) initiative. But without making it compulsory,
there's no penalty for failing to report an issue with a test vehicle."

DV software stacks are apparently opaque about decision logic that affects
movement, steering, etc. NHTSA would need to see these logs for post-mortem
accident triage. And so would a trial by jury.

Imposing and enforcing mandatory regulations on DV industry products will
establish governance accountability that partially balances profit pursuit
and public safety trust. Regulatory enforcement will slow DV innovation --
the playground will close up -- as a trade that enables deployment of
stable, though quirky (non-deterministic), DV fleets.

DV technology's safety promise, and public trust, remains to be earned by
showing a significant reduction in traffic accidents, injuries, and
fatalities. Few elected officials possess the bravado, and enlightened
wisdom, to approve local deployments that place their electorates in harm's
way. Potentially unrecoverable losses: brand outrage and human causalities
represent the DV industry's Darwinian survival challenge.

Congress Says Foreign Intel Services Could Abuse Ad Networks for Spying

A group of bipartisan lawmakers asked Google, Twitter, and others about the
transfer of bidstream data to foreign entities.

by Joseph Cox  April 6, 2021, 1:00pm

A group of bipartisan lawmakers, including the chairman of the intelligence
committee, have asked ad networks such as Google and Twitter what foreign
companies they provide user data to, over concerns that foreign intelligence
agencies could be leveraging them to harvest sensitive information on
U.S. users, including their location.

"This information would be a goldmine for foreign intelligence services that
could exploit it to inform and supercharge hacking, blackmail, and influence
campaigns," a letter signed by Senators Ron Wyden, Mark Warner, Kirsten
Gillibrand, Sherrod Brown, Elizabeth Warren, and Bill Cassidy, reads. The
lawmakers sent the letter last week to AT&T, Verizon, Google, Twitter, and a
number of other companies that maintain advertisement platforms.

The concerns center around the process of so-called real-time bidding, and
the flow of "bidstream" data. Before an advertisement is displayed inside of
an app or a browsing session, different companies bid to get their ad into
that slot. As part of that process, participating companies obtain sensitive
data on the user, even if they don't win the ad placement.

"Few Americans realize that some auction participants are siphoning off and
storing 'bidstream' data to compile exhaustive dossiers about them. In turn,
these dossiers are being openly sold to anyone with a credit card, including
to hedge funds, political campaigns, and even to governments," the letter
continued.

Venntel, a government contractor that sells location data to Immigration and
Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other law enforcement agencies obtains
bidstream data, Motherboard previously reported.  Israeli surveillance
companies Rayzone and Bsightful also source this sort of data, Forbes
reported.

"This is a deeply problematic practice when Western governments are abusing
the data flows, and it becomes a national security emergency when these same
global advertising companies are not vetting their own partners," Zach
Edwards, a researcher who has closely followed the supply chain of various
sources of data, told Motherboard in an online chat.

"It's long overdue for Congress to begin asking the largest tech companies
in the world tough questions about their real-time-data-breach technology
that underpins global advertising auctions and user data supply chains,"
Edwards continued. "Every time a person loads a website or a mobile app,
it's likely that their data is being shared with at least dozens of
companies, and when that user is interacting with an app or site with banner
ads, typically several thousand companies could be receiving data about that
visit in order to give those companies 'the opportunity to bid to show ads
to that user.'"

The letter asked the ad companies to name the foreign-headquartered or
foreign-majority owned firms that they have provided bidstream data from
users in the U.S. to in the past three years. The other companies the
lawmakers sent the letter to were Index Exchange, Magnite, OpenX, and
PubMatic.

Mark Tallman, assistant professor at the Department of Emergency Management
and Homeland Security at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, told
Motherboard in an email that "It's difficult to imagine any policy solution
or technical sorcery that can fully 'secure' consumers' private data such
that applications and platforms can collect it, and the publishing and
advertising industries can access it, while guaranteeing that cybercriminals
and foreign intelligence agencies will never get it. Our adversaries already
know that they can buy (or steal) data from our marketplace that they could
only dream of collecting on such a broad swath of Americans twenty years
ago."

In March lawyers filed a class action suit against Google for what they
described as selling users' data as part of the real-time bidding process.

"One of the biggest concerns about loot boxes is that they are very often

sometimes spend amounts of money their parents were not expecting, but some
show early signs of gambling addiction."

Risk: Adolescent gambling addiction

Similar to nicotine in cigarettes: once the dopamine starts flowing, it is
difficult to stop consumption.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_gambling#Prevalence (retrieved on

pathological gamblers. In the US, that's ~10M people with a gambling

If there *is* any increase in security threats, I'm sure the real culprits
are:

 - a huge surge in spam, fraud, and phishing emails.  This has been going on
   ever since the pandemic started, and it's gotten worse in the past couple
   of months.

 - a lack of "work from home" policies on the part of businesses, and no
   real thought about the risks involved in simply sending people home and
   telling them to carry on as usual (in a highly unusual situation).

 - no provision or budget for the computers, devices, and security software
   that might be needed to provide extra protection in WFH situations.

Subject: Marylanders could soon be fined $100 for intentionally releasing
  balloons (DCist)

The Balloon Council, a national balloon trade group, supports efforts to
prevent balloon releases, but argues that balloon release bans are not the
answer.

“It's really people's behavior that needs to change,” Lorna O'Hara, the
council's executive director, told WAMU/DCist last year when the balloon
bill was first introduced in the Maryland legislature. “Balloons are not the
culprit.”

O'Hara said mass balloon releases are not nearly as common as they were in
decades past, and she credits education efforts. She said more education is
what's needed now, not a balloon release ban. “It's a slippery slope from a
release ban to banning the product altogether.”

Several other states already have some sort of balloon release ban in place,
including Virginia, which prohibits the release of more than 50 balloons
within one hour, subject to a fine of up to $5 per balloon.

https://dcist.com/story/21/04/08/marylanders-could-soon-be-fined-100-for-intentionally-releasing-balloons/

Don't pick on innocent balloons, says the Balloon Council, who should
know. First they'll ban releasing balloons, then they'll register them, then
the ultimate goal -- confiscating them.

Subject: Scientists Create Online Games to Show Risks of AI Emotion
  Recognition (Nicola Davis)

Nicola Davis, *The Guardian*, 4 Apr 2021 via ACM TechNews 9 Apr 2021

Scientists at the U.K.'s University of Cambridge have created emojify.info,
a website where the public can test emotion recognition systems via online
games, using their own computer cameras. One game has players make faces to
fake emotions in an attempt to fool the systems; another challenges the
technology to interpret facial expressions contextually. Cambridge's Alexa
Hagerty cited a lack of public awareness of how widespread the technology
is, adding that its potential benefits should be weighed against concerns
about accuracy, racial bias, and suitability. Hagerty said although the
technology's developers claim these systems can read emotions, in reality
they read facial movements and combine them with existing assumptions that
these movements embody emotions (as in, a smile means one is happy). The
researchers said their goal is to raise awareness of the technology and to
encourage dialogue about its use.

Subject: We tested the first state's vaccine passport: Here's what to expect
  (WashPost)

New York's Excelsior Pass has some solid privacy protections. But it's
complicated to use and easy to fake.

Vaccine passports could leave us exposed to the “worst of both worlds,” says
Cahn — a complicated digital system that puts up new barriers to access
businesses, while not actually stopping fraudsters. “Despite its
invasiveness, Excelsior Pass won't advance the underlying public health
goals it claims to support,” he says.

It isn't clear how wide a problem vaccine passport fraud could become, or
how dangerous it would be. Passports could persuade people to let down their
guard about masks and other protections. Madison Square Garden, for one,
says it wasn't aware of any cases of people trying to enter the venue with
an Excelsior Pass that wasn't their own.

“To be clear, Excelsior Pass is a voluntary system that creates a digital
copy of a preexisting paper record — it is not a standalone identification
document,” said Kristin Devoe, a spokeswoman for Empire State Development,
the umbrella organization that created Excelsior Pass. To fight fraud, New
York says venues accepting Excelsior Pass are supposed to check people's
photo IDs.

But instituting new ID checks at businesses that didn't used to require them
creates new social barriers. One senior citizen tester was too old to have a
driver's license.

Subject: GoToMeeting/GoToWebinar

OK, I've presented on Zoom, and Teams, and Meet, and some others during this
crisis.  And, tomorrow, I'm doing yet another pres, and they are using
GoToWebinar (I think.  One of the two.)  So I asked for a test run.

First off, unlike Zoom and Teams (and unnecessary on Meet) the GoToMeeting
link didn't automatically download the app.  (A "button," on the weirdly
formatted reminder the system sent, did, so there is obviously some
additional stuff in there besides the meeting link.)

When I *did* get the app installed on the laptop, I got on to the test
meeting, but obviously nobody could hear me.  Through a variety of testing,
involving switching my (one) microphone back and forth between computers,
and a phone call, I finally figured out that GoToWebinar (at least) doesn't
check or even allow for external microphones (even if you try and get
Windows to tell it to).  (Except that it *would* accept the external
microphone on my desktop, which has no built-in microphone.)  I am
hypothesizing that this might be in regard to the extremely tight control
that GoToWebinar seems to provide, by default, completely cutting off
presenters from any form of contact with attendees.

We did, eventually figure out a kludge, where I could run the slides and set
up the microphone on my desktop, and simply use the laptop for the Webcam so
people could see me.  However, they finally decided nobody needed to see me
(which is no great loss).

Isn't videoconferencing fun?   (NOT!)

institutions of authority progressively less able to do so.''

I think that the original article was about the attitude made popular lately
by interest groups, which debases science by using any scientific division

so-called "experts" don't know what they're talking about!".

Such attitudes, about any subject related to science -- moon landings,
