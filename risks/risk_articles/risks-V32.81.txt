Inspectors repeatedly found manufacturing and device quality problems with
the HeartWare heart pump. But the FDA did not penalize the company, and
patients had the device implanted on their hearts without knowing the facts.

In this posting and paper pre-print,

https://lukeoakdenrayner.wordpress.com/2021/08/02/ai-has-the-worst-superpower-medical-racism/
https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10356

Luke Oakden-Rayner describes a jaw-dropping accomplishment of a medical AI
system: it learned to recognize the self-reported racial identity of medical
patients by analyzing their X-rays(!). Even more remarkable, it has thus far
proven infeasible to discover how it does so, in part because humans are
unable to perform the same feat.

On one level, this is a bad risk for medical care driven by inscrutable
black boxes. But there are potential counter-measures to mitigate the
effect.

On another level, this is a fascinating intellectual and research challenge:
how *does* it do that, and why can people apparently not do the same thing?

And on yet another level, what does this result imply for fooling AI-driven
systems in all sorts of other contexts? Or for making tamper-resistant AI
systems?

  (WiReD)

The vulnerabilities the Armis researchers found in TransLogic PTS offerings
aren't directly exploitable from the open Internet. But they're all
relatively simple flaws to take advantage of, a smattering of hardcoded
passwords, buffer overflows, memory corruption bugs, and the like. An
attacker on the same network as the web of pneumatic tubes and control
panels would have multiple paths to manipulate the system.  And by
exploiting certain flaws, they could even install their own unvalidated
firmware on a Translogic Nexus Control Panel. For attackers, this would be
an avenue to establishing deep, lasting control—hospitals would need to
install another curative firmware update to eradicate the intruders.

Smells like a cyber-attack
https://www.timesofisrael.com/4-ships-in-gulf-of-oman-lose-control-days-after-drone-strike-on-vessel/

At least six ships off the coast of the United Arab Emirates broadcast
warnings [on 3 Aug 2021] that they had lost control of their steering under
unclear circumstances as British authorities reported “a potential hijack”
was underway in the area.

The six vessels announced around the same time via their Automatic
Identification System trackers that they were “not under command,” according
to MarineTraffic.com. That typically means a vessel has lost power and can
no longer steer.

  “At the same time, if they are in the same vicinity and in the same place,
  then very rarely that happens,” said Ranjith Raja, an oil and shipping
  expert with data firm Refintiv. “Not all the vessels would lose their
  engines or their capability to steer at the same time.”

Subject: The Full Story of the Stunning RSA Hack Can Finally Be Told (WiReD)

On that Australian employee’s PC, someone had used a tool that pulled
credentials out of the machine's memory and then reused those usernames and
passwords to log into other machines on the network. They’d then scraped
those computers’ memories for more usernames and passwords -- finding some
that belonged to more privileged administrators.  The hackers eventually got
to a server containing hundreds of users’ credentials. Today that
credential-stealing hopscotching technique is common. But in 2011 the
analysts were surprised to see how the hackers fanned out across the
network. “It was really just the most brutal way to blow through our systems
that I’d ever seen,” Duane says.

Subject: Revealed: leak uncovers global abuse of cyber-surveillance weapon
  (The Guardian)

*Spyware sold to authoritarian regimes used to target activists,
politicians and journalists, data suggests*

Human rights activists, journalists and lawyers across the world have been
targeted by authoritarian governments using hacking software sold by the
Israeli surveillance company NSO Group, according to an investigation into
a massive data leak.

The investigation by the Guardian and 16 other media organisations suggests
widespread and continuing abuse of NSO’s hacking spyware, Pegasus, which
the company insists is only intended for use against criminals and
terrorists.

Pegasus is a malware that infects iPhones and Android devices to enable
operators of the tool to extract messages, photos and emails, record calls
and secretly activate microphones.

The leak contains a list of more than 50,000 phone numbers that, it is
believed, have been identified as those of people of interest by clients of
NSO since 2016.

Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based nonprofit media organisation, and Amnesty
International initially had access to the leaked list and shared access
with media partners as part of the Pegasus project, a reporting consortium.

The presence of a phone number in the data does not reveal whether a device
was infected with Pegasus or subject to an attempted hack. However, the
consortium believes the data is indicative of the potential targets NSO’s
government clients identified in advance of possible surveillance attempts.

Forensics analysis of a small number of phones whose numbers appeared on
the leaked list also showed more than half had traces of the Pegasus
spyware.

The Guardian and its media partners will be revealing the identities of
people whose number appeared on the list in the coming days. They include
hundreds of business executives, religious figures, academics, NGO
employees, union officials and government officials, including cabinet
ministers, presidents and prime ministers.

The list also contains the numbers of close family members of one country’s
ruler, suggesting the ruler may have instructed their intelligence agencies
to explore the possibility of monitoring their own relatives.

The disclosures begin on Sunday, with the revelation that the numbers of
more than 180 journalists are listed in the data, including reporters,
editors and executives at the Financial Times, CNN, the New York Times,
France 24, the Economist, Associated Press and Reuters.

The phone number of a freelance Mexican reporter, Cecilio Pineda Birto, was
found in the list, apparently of interest to a Mexican client in the weeks
leading up to his murder, when his killers were able to locate him at a
carwash. His phone has never been found so no forensic analysis has been
possible to establish whether it was infected.  [...]

Subject: Apple to Scan iPhones for Child Sex Abuse Images (BBC News)

James Clayton, *BBC News*, 5 Aug 2021 via ACM TechNews, 6 Aug, 2021

Apple has unveiled a system designed to scan U.S. customers' iPhones to
determine if they contain child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The system
compares photo files on each handset to a database of known CSAM gathered by
the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other
organizations. Before an iPhone can be used to upload an image to the iCloud
Photos platform, the technology will look for matches to known CSAM; matches
are evaluated by human reviewers who report confirmed matches to law
enforcement. The company said the system's privacy benefits are
significantly better than existing techniques, because Apple only learns
about users' images if their iCloud Photos accounts contain collections of
known CSAM.

Subject: Hacking a Capsule Hotel to Silence a Noisy Neighbor
  (Infosecurity Magazine)

Security researcher Kya Supa was staying at a capsule hotel in Japan while
on vacation and had a noisy neighbor.

Every day at around 2 a.m., the neighbor would be on the phone making a
loud call. Supa politely asked the neighbor to not be so loud, but the
neighbor didn't listen. What happened next was the subject of Supa's
session at the Black Hat US 2021 hybrid event, where he detailed how he
was able to hack the hotel's system to get back at his noisy neighbor,
whom he referred to as Bob.

"Some people just don't take anything seriously," Supa said about Bob.
"So I thought it would be nice if I could take control of his room and
make him have a lovely night."

Subject: Hackers Turning to 'Exotic' Programming Languages for Malware
  Development (The Hacker News)

Threat actors are increasingly shifting to "exotic" programming languages
such as Go, Rust, Nim, and Dlang that can better circumvent conventional
security protections, evade analysis, and hamper reverse engineering
efforts.

"Malware authors are known for their ability to adapt and modify their
skills and behaviors to take advantage of newer technologies," said
<https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/forms/enterprise/report-old-dogs-new-tricks>
Eric Milam, Vice President of threat research at BlackBerry. "That
tactic has multiple benefits from the development cycle and inherent
lack of coverage from protective products."

On the one hand, languages like Rust are more secure as they offer
guarantees like memory-safe programming
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)#Memory_safety>,
but they can also be a double-edged sword when malware engineers abuse the
same features designed to offer increased safeguards to their advantage,
thereby making malware less susceptible to exploitation and thwart attempts
to activate a kill-switch
<https://thehackernews.com/2020/08/emotet-botnet-malware.html> and render
them powerless.

Noting that binaries written in these languages can appear more complex,
convoluted, and tedious when disassembled, the researchers said the pivot
adds additional layers of obfuscation, simply by virtue of them being
relatively new, leading to a scenario where older malware developed using
traditional languages like C++ and C# are being actively retooled with
droppers and loaders written in uncommon alternatives to evade detection by
endpoint security systems. [...]

Subject: Re: Hackers using 'Exotic' PLs for Malware

Headline from the Prohibition Era:

  "Bootleggers using powerful cars and speedboats to outrun police and Coast
  Guard"

'Exotic' PL's is a "dog bites man" headline, if I ever saw one.

What's the takeaway?

Should 'exotic' programming languages be banned, because criminals use them?
Perhaps high-quality food should also be banned, because criminals eat it?

High-quality 'exotic' programming languages can dramatically reduce the
types of bugs that enable malware in the first place, much like better
locks can reduce theft.

Perhaps the criminals are doing us all a favor & dramatically
demonstrating the advantages of these 'exotic' languages?
