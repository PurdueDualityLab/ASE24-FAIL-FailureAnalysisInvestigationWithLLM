Traffic congestion in the skies.
http://bigstory.ap.org/article/faa-jet-nearly-collided-drone

FAA in AP News, 9 May 2014

San Francisco (AP): Federal officials say a U.S. jet airliner nearly
collided in March with an airborne drone in the sky over Tallahassee,
Florida.

Jim Williams of the Federal Aviation Administration's unmanned aircraft
systems office acknowledged the incident Thursday at a San Francisco drone
conference, citing it as an example of the risks posed by integrating drones
into U.S. airspace. [...]

The pilot of the 50-seat Canadair Regional Jet CRJ-200 airliner said the
camouflage-colored drone was at an altitude of about 2,300 feet, five miles
northeast of the airport. FAA rules state that the aircraft should be kept
below 400 feet above ground level and should be flown a sufficient distance
from full-scale aircraft. [...]

Last week, the National Park Service issued a statement reminding visitors
that federal regulations ban the use of drones within Yosemite National
Park.

Drone sightings there have become a nearly daily occurrence in the venerated
national park, with the devices buzzing loudly near waterfalls, above
meadows or over treetops as guests use them to capture otherwise
impossible-to-get photographs of the breathtaking landscape.

Subject: Press conference on Estonian Internet voting system

A team of independent security researchers (Alex Halderman, Harri Hursti,
Jason Kitcat, Maggie MacAlpine, and two U. Michigan graduate students) held
a press conference in Estonia today exposing severe security vulnerabilities
in their Internet voting system and in the processes by which it was
administered. They called for Estonia to withdraw the system from use before
the European upcoming parliamentary elections, and suggested tat it would
not be possible to fix the system, or indeed any Internet voting system, for
a decade or more. They point out that since the Estonian system was designed
the threat environment faced by online systems has gotten much worse, with
not only criminals but also nation states actively compromising online
systems today.

The slides presented at the press conference, the movie they showed, and an
audio recording of the press conference itself are all online at

  https://estoniaevoting.org/press-release/

[Later today, they are expected to post a video of the press conference and
also the formal written version of their report.  But what is already
available is very timely.  For example, see the next item.]

Internet voting is of course a disastrous idea, for so many reasons (not to

would be used to cast the votes). I won't even bother here to start
referencing the many papers on this topic, including my own "Hacking the

  (Chris Strohm)

FYI -- These break-ins are the electronic equivalent of FBI raids lobbing
tear gas and kicking down doors with automatic weapons drawn.  Inevitably,
there are some percentage of breakins at the wrong address of innocent
people.

These types of proposals are also particularly worrisome, now that we know
that the FBI, the NSA & the FISA panels interpret ordinary words with
meanings completely different from the way you and I would interpret them.
As a result, it is impossible to even properly interpret the language of the
proposals, since encoded in the words of these proposals are secret court
interpretations of some of the words used.

Chris Strohm, Federal Agents Seek to Loosen Rules on Hacking Computers,
Bloomberg, 10 May 2014

The proposal arrives at a precipitous time for a government still managing
backlash to electronic-spying practices by the National Security Agency that
were exposed last year by former contractor Edward Snowden.

A U.S. proposal to expand the U.S. Justice Department's ability to hack
into computers during criminal investigations is furthering tension in the
debate over how to balance privacy rights with the need to keep the country
safe.

A committee of judges that sets national policy governing criminal
investigations will try to sort through it all.  It's weighing a proposal
made public yesterday that would give federal agents greater leeway to
secretly access suspected criminals' computers in bunches, not simply one at
a time.

The underlying goal is to take rules written for searching property and
modernize them for the Internet age.  The proposal arrives at a precipitous
time for a government still managing backlash to electronic spying by the
National Security Agency that was exposed last year by contractor Edward
Snowden.

``What I think we're looking for as a society is a way to investigate crime
while limiting the exposure of information that should be kept private,''
While the intent of the proposal is reasonable, the idea of law enforcement
potentially placing malware on computers of innocent Americans that can
access personal data is a cause for concern.  (Stephen Saltzburg, a law
professor at George Washington University.)

``I don't think many Americans would be comfortable with the government
sending code onto their computers without their knowledge or consent The
power they're seeking is certainly a broad one.''  (Nathan Freed Wessler, a
lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union.)

  [Lots more salient stuff omitted:
     Traditional Rules ...

Only Option

The department must describe the computer it wants to target with as much
detail as possible.  For example, an investigator may be covertly
communicating with a suspected child molester and know an IP address, and
then obtain a warrant to use malware to find the actual location.  In the
case of botnets, malware might be used to try to free the compromised
computers from a criminal's control. [...]

  Since the FCC seems to have no problem with this idea, I've (through
  correspondence) gotten access to the FCC's internal IP block, and
  throttled all connections from the FCC to 28.8kbps modem speeds on the
  Neocities.org front site, and I'm not removing it until the FCC pays us
  for the bandwidth they've been wasting instead of doing their jobs
  protecting us from the "keep America's Internet slow and expensive
  forever" lobby.

  The Ferengi Plan

  The Ferengi plan is a special FCC-only plan that costs $1000 per year, and
  removes the 28.8kbps modem throttle to the FCC.  We will happily take
  Credit Cards, Bitcoin, and Dogecoin from crooked FCC executives that
  probably have plenty of money from bribes on our Donations page (sorry, we

  will include language that would make clear that the FCC will scrutinize
  the deals to make sure that the broadband providers don't unfairly put
  nonpaying companies' content at a disadvantage, according to an agency
  official.  The official said the draft would also seek comment on whether
  such agreements, called "paid prioritization," should be banned outright,
  and look to prohibit the big broadband companies, such as Comcast
  Corp. CMCSA -0.20% and AT&T Inc., T +0.11% from doing deals with some

Subject: The perils of PayWave

The banks in New Zealand have brought in a new scheme called PayWave, where
you can pay a bill under $80 merely by vaguely waving your credit card at
the terminal.  http://www.visa.co.nz/personal/features/visapaywave.shtml

Problem 1: my wife and I have both had the experience that we were bringing
our cards up to the terminal in order to pay for groceries when suddenly the
terminal said payment accepted.  Since all our accounts are on the same card
as the credit account (not negotiable; that's just the way the card comes
from the bank) this meant that the money was drawn from *wrong* account.

http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/8808751/How-safe-are-paywave-cards
has a story of someone who was apparently debited from a terminal other than
the one she was paying from.  I have heard conflicting accounts of what the
range of a PayWave reader is.

If there is a PayWave reader and a normal chip-and-pin reader, and they are
close together, it can be very tricky to get your card into the chip-and-pin
reader without triggering PayWave.

Problem 2: the point of PayWave is to let you make a payment effortlessly.
In particular, without entering a PIN.  It turns out that you are allowed to
make up to 6 PayWave payments a day.  This means that if you lose your card,
it takes absolutely no skill for the finder to steal nearly $480 from your
account (in goods).  Visa have a "zero liability policy", which means it
would "just" cost me time, but Visa will lose $480 and I'm sure they'll get
it back from customers somehow.

Problem 3: we were surprised to be PayWaved because we hadn't opted in.  But
it's worse: there is no opt out.  We rang our bank and asked for PayWave to
be disabled for our cards, and were told that it could not be done.  Of
course, as IT people, we all know that it *could* be done, it's just that
someone decided they didn't want to.  ALL Visa cards issued in NZ are now
PayWave cards, like it or not.  Even so, I don't see why a smart card
couldn't have a "don't PayWave me" bit on it.

I don't want to join the tinfoil hat brigade, but I am seriously thinking of
keeping my cards in a metal tin.

MPs: Snowden files are 'embarrassing indictment' of British spying oversight

All-party committee demands reforms to make security and intelligence
services accountable in wake of disclosures

Alan Travis, *The Guardian,* 9 May 2014

Edward Snowden's disclosures of the scale of mass surveillance are "an
embarrassing indictment" of the weak nature of the oversight and legal
accountability of Britain's security and intelligence agencies, MPs have
concluded.

A highly critical report by the Commons home affairs select committee
published on Friday calls for a radical reform of the current system of
oversight of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, arguing that the current system is so
ineffective it is undermining the credibility of the intelligence agencies
and parliament itself.

The MPs say the current system was designed in a pre-Internet age when a
person's word was accepted without question.  "It is designed to scrutinise
the work of George Smiley, not the 21st-century reality of the security and
intelligence services," said committee chairman, Keith Vaz.  "The agencies
are at the cutting edge of sophistication and are owed an equally refined
system of democratic scrutiny.  It is an embarrassing indictment of our
system that some in the media felt compelled to publish leaked information
to ensure that matters were heard in parliament."  ...

An alleged identity thief was involved in a car crash. She showed a stolen
drivers license to the other driver, who took a photo of the license while
the thief held it. The other driver was suspicious that the license photo
didn't match, and gave the photo to police. Police were able to get partial
fingerprints from the photo, which they matched to prints on file from a
prior arrest. Police arrested the thief, but have not recovered the stolen
drivers license.

The photo is in the original newspaper article. One index fingertip is about

Subject: Snapchat: Off the Record in a Chat App? Don't Be Sure
  (Jenna Wortham)

Jenna Wortham, *The New York Times*, 8 May 2014

What happens on the Internet stays on the Internet.

That truth was laid bare on Thursday, when Snapchat, the popular mobile
messaging service, agreed to settle charges by the Federal Trade Commission
that messages sent through the company's app did not disappear as easily as
promised.

Snapchat has built its service on a pitch that has always seemed almost too
good to be true: that people can send any photo or video to friends and have
it vanish without a trace. That promise has appealed to millions of people,
particularly younger Internet users seeking refuge from nosy parents, school
administrators and potential employers.

But the commission charged that there were several easy ways to save
messages from the service, and in settling the accusations, the company
agreed not to misrepresent the disappearing nature of its messages.

The company's early popularity and hype led to a multibillion-dollar buyout
offer last year from Facebook, which Snapchat's leaders spurned in the hope
of something better. But the settlement announced on Thursday set a
different tone, one that could extend to the many other start-ups that
promise security, privacy and anonymity as an antidote to the public nature
of Facebook and Twitter. ...

Subject: Federal court overturns Google v. Oracle decision, setting
  disastrous precedent (Russell Brandom)

Russell Brandom, *The Verge*, 9 May 2014

Federal court overturns Google v. Oracle decision, setting disastrous
precedent
http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/9/5699958/federal-court-overturns-google-v-oracle

Today, a federal court ruled that Google must pay Oracle for its use of the
Java API in Android, setting a broad precedent that already has many legal
scholars crying foul. If the ruling stands, it will give software companies
copyright over their APIs, the interfaces that programs use to communicate
with each other. The new standard is good news for Oracle, which holds the
rights to Java and its widely used API, but potentially disastrous for
software developers that want to build on top of APIs. If the APIs are no
longer free to use, new services may be forced to start from scratch, making
it astronomically more difficult to coordinate between programs.
http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4431835/13-1021.Opinion.5-7-2014.1.pdf

APIs are one of the most important tools in modern programming, allowing
third-party services to pull information automatically from central services
like Google, Facebook and Twitter. (Apps like Tweetdeck, for instance, get
your tweets by calling on Twitter's API.) In this case, Google the Android
OS on top of a modified version of Java, but kept Java's API to make it
easier for programmers to write for Android. Since many coders were already
familiar with the quirks of Java's API, the decision gave them a head start
in writing programs for Android -- but from the beginning, Oracle wanted
Google to pay for the privilege. In May of 2012
http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/31/3055620/oracle-java-api-not-covered-copyright-law/in/2731667
a district court ruled that copyrighting the calls would simply tie up "a
utilitarian and functional set of symbols," and gave Google free rein on the
API. Oracle appealed the ruling, and two years later, a federal court has
overturned. The next step is the Supreme Court, but it could be years before
the issue is finally settled.

Already, the ruling has drawn disapproval from IP advocates.
<http://www.vox.com/2014/5/9/5699960/this-court-decision-is-a-disaster-for-the-software-industry>.
Villanova law professor Michael Risch blames the court
<http://madisonian.net/2014/05/09/oracle-v-google-reversed-framing-matters/>
for granting too strong of a copyright, preferring a conception that allows
for interoperability and reuse: "Google should surely be privileged to do
what it did without having to resort to fair use." Going further, University
of Maryland professor James Grimmelmann writes, "This is an opinion written
by judges whose understanding of software comes from reading other judges'
opinions about software." In even simpler terms, Sarah Jeong writes, "It's
like getting mad at a screwdriver for looking like a screwdriver."

From: "Richard A. O'Keefe" <ok@cs.otago.ac.nz>
Subject: Re: The risks of garbage collection delays (Loughran, RISKS-27.87)

Steve Loughran raised two interesting points.

"Garbage collection can introduce delays".  We want two things
from any memory management scheme, automatic or manual:
(1) Resources are released as soon as they are no longer needed.
(2) There are no long delays.

Unfortunately, we cannot have both.  Classical reference counting means that
a memory object is released as soon as the run time system notices there are
no more references to it, and finalizers can be used to release external
resources promptly.  The Limbo programming language does this.  However,
imagine constructing a 2GB acyclic graph of objects and then nilling the
last pointer to it.  You *must* get a long delay as each object in turn is
purged.  There are techniques for deferring this work so that pauses are
much smaller, but then you do not get prompt release of external objects.
Manual memory management can be understood as a sporadically buggy
approximation of reference counting.

The answer of course, is that there are several hard real time garbage
collection algorithms out there which DON'T have long pauses, but for that
to be possible, they cannot release objects or references to external
objects promptly.  So you have to make a very clear distinction between
closing an external resource and forgetting it.  The C# 'using (Type id create) stmt' statement and the Java 'try (Type id = create) stmt' statement
are about closing a connection to an external resource, and make no claim
about when the memory of the object will be reclaimed.

The second point he raised is "how can a remote network client distinguish
"hung process' from "process undergoing very large GC pauses"?  The short
answer to that is "it cannot".  There are all sorts of things, from network
congestion, to temporarily moving out of cell phone coverage, to driving
through an underpass, to lines being accidentally disconnected, to process
being shifted off one processor to another for load balancing, to slowness
of a numerical algorithm to converge, which can cause delays without the
server process being crashed or hung.

I fail to see what the point would be of burdening garbage collectors with
sending messages out to clients when GC pauses are just one of MANY kinds of
unpredictable but noticeable delay and the other kinds don't come with
notification schemes.  In a distributed system, a client HAS to be prepared
to time out a remote transaction, and HAS to be prepared to discover that it
was a false alarm.  (Nobody ever said distributed was easy.)

I suggest that the answer to the problem of GC delays in processes with 100
GB address spaces is "don't design such systems in the first place; make big
systems be collections of loosely coupled components that are independently
GCed."  (For example, while an Erlang 'node' may have a single address
space, each Erlang 'process' (thread) is independently GCed.)

> Reference counting cannot correctly handle circular references. ...

This is where get fuzzy on the "linear types" etc.: as far as I can see it
all works only if you don't copy pointers/references. As long as every copy
is a copy of the value and every reference exists in the same or nested
scope, this works.

Unfortunately deep copy of every value means a lot of memory copying.
Which, according to the "LISP could do real-time garbage collection in
the 70's" paper cited upthread was a zero-cost operation in the LISP
machines of the 1970's but in my observable reality can actually be
quite expensive. As far as I know the best we can do in 2010's is
copy-on-write which makes it close to zero cost for as long as the value
remains read-only. And if it is read-only you can declare it const and
safely copy the reference and you're back to square 1 where copying
references is not allowed.

However, this seems to be getting way off topic for RISKS.
