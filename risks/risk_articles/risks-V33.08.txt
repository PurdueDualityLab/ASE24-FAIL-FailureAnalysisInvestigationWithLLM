Subject: Surprisingly many risky infusion pumps? Are you part of the IoT?

Three out of four infusion pumps used to deliver medications and fluids to
patients have cybersecurity flaws, putting them at increased risk of being
compromised by hackers, according to a new study by Palo Alto Networks' Unit
42 threat research service.

https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/infusion-pump-vulnerabilities/

  An analysis of more than 200,000 infusion pumps from seven medical device
  manufacturers, using crowd-sourced data supplied by healthcare
  organizations, found more than half of the devices were susceptible to
  "critical" and "high" severity cybersecurity vulnerabilities. "Security
  lapses in these devices have the potential to put lives at risk or expose
  sensitive patient data," states the report, noting that infusion pumps can
  number in the thousands in a large hospital or clinic.

The Palo Alto Networks study mirrors results from a January research report
<https://www.cynerio.com/landing-pages/the-state-of-healthcare-iot-device-security-2022>
by security firm Cynerio, which found that IV infusion pumps make up 38% of
a hospital's typical Internet of Things (IoT) footprint, with 73% of those
devices having a vulnerability "that would jeopardize patient safety, data
confidentiality, or service availability if it were to be exploited by an
adversary."

Infusion pumps are the most common connected medical devices in hospitals
and "possess the lion's share" of cybersecurity risk, concluded Cynerio's
January report. The Palo Alto Networks study, released on 2 Mar 2022
identified more than 40 different vulnerabilities and over 70 different
security alerts among infusion pumps, with one or more affecting 75% of the
200,000 devices analyzed on the networks of mostly U.S. healthcare
organizations.

"One of the most striking findings was that 52% of all infusion pumps
scanned were susceptible to two known vulnerabilities that were disclosed in
2019 -- one with 'critical' severity, the other with 'high' severity,
respectively:
<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12255>
<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12264>

The study also points out that the average infusion pump has a life of eight
to 10 years, resulting in the widespread use of legacy devices that have
hampered efforts to improve cybersecurity.

Becton Dickinson's Alaris System vulnerabilities listed in the Palo Alto
Networks report were disclosed by the company in 2017, 2019 and 2020. BD
made software updates available to fix these vulnerabilities and encouraged
customers to update to BD Alaris PCU version 12.1.2, which became available
in July 2021, according to the report's researchers.

Still, despite the availability of a patch last year, the Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in the BD pumps "still had a 50.39% and
39.54% representation in the hospitals," according to Chris Gates, director
of product security at medical device engineering firm Velentium.

"While BD has been a responsible manufacturer, the hospitals have not been
updating their pumps," which is "magnified by the long service life of these
pumps in the hospital," Gates said.

Other cybersecurity experts such as Harbor Labs' Director of Medical
Security Mike Rushanan, who has worked with a wide variety of infusion
systems, are not impressed with the security practices of much of the
infusion pump industry.

"Some infusion pump manufacturers do cybersecurity right, and you don't see
them on this list. Others, like BD, you'll see over and over," Rushanan
said.  At the same time, Gates is critical of Baxter's response to known
vulnerabilities in their infusion pumps.  "The Baxter pumps have a raft of
high scoring vulnerabilities," Gates said. "These types of vulnerabilities
display a complete disregard for cybersecurity by the manufacturer, this
isn't some advanced attack by a nation-state or newly discovered
vulnerability in a third-party component. No, this is just not meeting their
responsibility as a medical device manufacturer."

In an emailed statement, Baxter said that the company "self-identified,
investigated and disclosed" vulnerabilities related to its devices that were
noted in the study.

"Securing medical devices, including infusion pumps, is not a one-time
event. It requires ongoing vigilance throughout the lifecycle and operation
of the pump," it said. "Baxter's product security team is continuously
monitoring for potential vulnerabilities in our medical devices."

A spokesperson at BD said the company planned to issue a statement about the
matter today. It wasn't made available at the time of publication.

Baxter's recent infusion pump safety notification, which regards improper
device use, adds to the cybersecurity concerns with the machines. BD has
similarly had recent problems with its pumps, issuing multiple recalls over
the last several years due to machine malfunctions.
<https://www.medtechdive.com/news/baxter-warns-of-missed-alarms-with-some-of-its-infusion-pumps/619215/>

"Recalls, whether due to mechanical failure or cybersecurity vulnerability,
can be a source of anxiety for supply chain managers, clinical engineers and
IT security teams," Palo Alto Networks said in the study. "The at-risk
devices must be identified, found and retired or repaired per the
instruction of a given recall. An oversight or a miss in any of these areas
– whether the devices need repair, maintenance, software patches or updates
– can put patient lives or sensitive information at risk."

The Palo Alto Networks study called on the healthcare industry to "redouble
efforts to protect against known vulnerabilities" in infusion pumps. Still,
Velentium's Gates is skeptical that both hospitals and medical device
manufacturers are up to the task, despite the continuing risks to patient
safety.  "I would love to see these studies repeated in a year to see how
many are still unpatched and still in use in the hospitals.  Sadly, I would
suspect they would find very similar numbers," Gates said.

"Counterfeit medications and pharmaceutical products are just a click
away from being purchased from online pharmacies via smartphone."

The Pharmaceutical Security Institute summarizes grim statistics about
arrests, drug categories, and the global geographic distribution for
counterfeit medicines for incidents greater than US$ 100K in product
value. No aggregated revenue information about the crimes are disclosed.
See https://www.psi-inc.org/therapeutic-categories retrieved on 02MAR2022.

The AARP, via

in 2014.

To deter incentives to forge and sell into the marketplace, a silk-based
watermark will be imprinted on each pill or tablet to establish the
manufactured medicine's bona fides. Human digestive processes gracefully
degrade silk and the marking ink.

A cellphone app can be used to examine the watermark and confirm or
refute authenticity.

Risk: False negative/positive app outcome.

[Unclear how consumers can apply the app via pre-sale sample and buy.
Law enforcement can benefit by not having to subject the suspected goods
to rigorous chemical authenticity testing. Wonder if law enforcement use
of the app might be subject to illegal search and seizure challenges.]

   - Cybersecurity firm Symantec says the malware, which it calls Daxin,
   has been used to target high level, non-Western government agencies in Asia
   and Africa
   - Researchers say the discovery is noteworthy because of the scale of
   the intrusions and the advanced nature of the tool

Security researchers with US cybersecurity firm Symantec said they have
discovered a highly sophisticated Chinese hacking tool that has been able to
escape public attention for more than a decade.

The discovery was shared with the US government in recent months, who have
shared the information with foreign partners, said a US official. Symantec,
a division of chip maker Broadcom, published its research about the tool,
which it calls Daxin, on Monday.

``It's something we haven't seen before,'' said Clayton Romans, associate
director with the US Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).
``This is the exact type of information we’re hoping to receive.''

CISA highlighted Symantec's membership in a joint public-private
cybersecurity information sharing partnership, known as the JCDC, alongside
the new research paper.  [...]

Assessment of the Critical Supply Chains Supporting the U.S. Information
and Communications Technology Industry

23 February 2022

"In summary, open-source software and firmware are integral to the ICT
industrial base, enabling the development and functionality of nearly all
types of ICT software and hardware products. However, the nature of these
products in addition to the software supply chain itself present several
risks. First, the dynamic nature of software development exposes the supply
chain to countless sources of both known and unknown vulnerabilities, from
insecure open-source software to zero-day exploits.  Second, the growing
reliance on open-source software increases the risk and potential impact of
software supply chain attacks through methods such as package typo squatting
and malicious injects. Finally, firmware presents a large and ever-expanding
attack surface as the number of electronic devices grows and the ICT supply
chain increases in complexity. Product integrity assurance throughout the
ICT industry is important to ensure secure and reliable products."

Subject: Researchers Can Steal Data During Homomorphic Encryption (NCState)

Matt Shipman, NC State University News, 2 Mar 2022,
via ACM TechNews; 4 Mar 2022

Researchers at North Carolina State University (NC State) and Turkey's Dokuz
Eylul University have cracked next-generation homomorphic encryption via
side-channel attacks. Homomorphic encryption renders data unreadable to
third parties, while still permitting third parties and third-party
technologies to perform operations using the data. NC State's Aydin Aysu
said the process consumes much computing power, and the researchers were
able to read data during encryption by monitoring power consumption in the
data encoder using Microsoft's SEAL Homomorphic Encryption Library. "We were
able to do this with a single power measurement," Aysu noted, and the team
confirmed the flaw in the library up through least version 3.6.

Ravie Lakshmanan, *The Hacker News* 24 Feb 2022,
via ACM TechNews, 28 Feb 2022

Technology conglomerate Cisco has issued software patches to correct four
security flaws that hackers could exploit to commandeer affected systems.
The most critical patch fixes a command injection flaw in the NX-API feature
of Cisco NX-OS software, stemming from insufficient input validation of
user-supplied data. Cisco warned, "A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the
underlying operating system." Other bugs the patches target include two
high-severity denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities in NX-OS in the Cisco
Fabric Services Over IP and Bidirectional Forwarding Detection traffic
functions. The fourth patch corrects a DoS flaw in the Cisco Discovery
Protocol service of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software, which
could "allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the service to
restart, resulting in a denial of service condition."

Subject: Robust Radar: AI Sensor Technology for Autonomous Driving
  (Christoph Pelzl)

Christoph Pelzl, Graz University of Technology (Austria), 23 Feb 2022,
via ACM TechNews; 4 Mar 2022

An artificial intelligence (AI) system for automotive radar sensors
developed by researchers at Austria's Graz University of Technology (TU
Graz) filters out interfering signals from other radar sensors to improve
object detection. The researchers built model architectures for automatic
noise suppression based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To make
them more efficient, the researchers trained the neural networks with noisy
data and desired output values, then compressed the most efficient models
further by reducing bit widths, resulting in an AI model with high filter
performance and low energy consumption. Said TU Graz's Franz Pernkopf, "We
want to make CNNs' behavior a bit more explainable. We are not only
interested in the output result, but also in its range of variation. The
smaller the variance, the more certain the network is."

76A model developed by Cornell University researchers aims to help domestic
abuse survivors prevent assailants from hacking into their devices and
social media. With a focus on "continuity of care," the model matches
survivors of such abuse with a volunteer consultant who understands their
needs and provides a seamless relationship over time, giving them multiple
ways to communicate with their consultant safely, and securely storing their
tech abuse history and concerns. Cornell's Emily Tseng said, "In an ideal
world, the people on the 'Geek Squad' would be able to treat tech abuse with
the sensitivity of a social worker."

There is an important question I have that this article doesn't mention:
Other software companies have had data stolen. Has any of their stolen data
included signing certificates? If they aren't leaked (as was Nvidia's) we
might never know that criminals have those certificates in their possession,
since those who pay ransoms generally don't publicize what kind of data was
taken (if they even know).

Hiroko Tabuchi, *The New York Times* Business, B8,26 Feb 2022

The exodus of bitcoin miners from China (after last year's government
crackdown on cryptocurrencies) made cryptomining even worse for the climate.
Miners lost their access to cheap hydro-electric power in China, and
migrated (e,g., to Kazakhstan and the U.S.), resulting in the overall use of
more fossil fuels.  Researchers estimated Bitcoin mining may be responsible
for about 65 megatons of carbon dioxide annually.  (PGN-ed)

Subject: The metaverse will steal your identity (Unherd)

*Individuality will dissolve into mindless conformity*

In 1950, sociologist David Riesman declared that we were *The Lonely Crowd*.

In 2000, political scientist Robert D. Putnam told us we were *Bowling
Alone*. If the metaverse promises us one thing, it's that we will not be
lonely.

Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft (having recently purchased online
gaming giant Activision) are enthusiastically talking up the metaverse -- a
world of virtual reality-enhanced social interactions that will be more real
than reality. It will capture the nuances of offline interaction in
massively fulfilling virtual experiences and then monetise them. With
JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declaring it a trillion-dollar market, the
metaverse, if it succeeds, will be a constant presence in our lives.

chilling vision of the future, it's not for the Huxleyesque reasons usually
given. If the worry is that people will be drawn away from real life into an
online world provided by high-tech devices, that horse has already
bolted. Meta's talk of an *immersive* metaverse belies the fact that we are

It asks for all the organization's communications related to the proctoring
software industry.

The controversial proctoring platform Proctorio has filed a broad
subpoena against the prominent digital rights nonprofit Fight for the
Future as part of its legal battle with Miami University student Erik
Johnson, in what the group describes as an effort to silence critics
through legal maneuvering.

The fight between Johnson and the company began in September of 2020
when the student published a lengthy Twitter thread criticizing
Proctorio's practices, including excerpts of the platform's source code
that he’d posted on PasteBin. Proctorio filed a copyright takedown
notice. Three of the tweets were removed but later reinstated. The
Electronic Frontier Foundation then sued Proctorio on Johnson's behalf,
arguing that the takedown had ``interfered with Johnson’s First Amendment
right.''

Proctorio is one of the most prominent software platforms that schools use
to watch for cheating on remote tests. It records students through their
webcams as they work, monitoring their head positioning, and flags possible
signs of cheating to professors.

Subject: As Tanks Rolled Into Ukraine, So Did Malware. Then Microsoft
 Entered the War (David E. Sanger et al.)

David E. Sanger, Julian E. Barnes and Kate Conger, *The New York
Times*, 01 Mar 2022, via ACM TechNews; 2 Mar 2022

U.S. technology companies are helping to defend Ukraine against cyberattacks
orchestrated alongside the Russian invasion. Shortly before the military
incursion began, Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center responded to
previously unseen "wiper" malware targeting Ukraine's government ministries
and financial institutions; the center dissected the malware, informed
Ukraine's cyberdefense forces, and updated Microsoft's virus detection
systems to block the code within hours. Meanwhile, Meta said it had locked
down Facebook accounts of Ukrainian military officials and public figures
when hackers attempted to spread disinformation through them.
Corporate-government partnerships are being tested in the effort to analyze
and counter Russia's cyberoffensive tactics, with tech companies a primary
source of actionable intelligence.

Subject: The Impossible Suddenly Became Possible (Anne Applebaum)

  [via Dave Farber's IP distribution]  [Highly RISKS-relevant.  PGN]

When Russia invaded Ukraine, the West's assumptions about the world
became unsustainable.

Anne Applebaum, *The Atlantic*, 1 Mar 2022
https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/putins-war-dispelled-the-worlds-illusions/623335/

History has accelerated; the impossible has become possible. Shifts that no
one imagined two weeks ago are unfolding with incredible speed.

As it turns out, nations are not pieces in a game of Risk. They do not, as
some academics have long imagined, have eternal interests or permanent
geopolitical orientations, fixed motivations or predictable goals. Nor do
human beings always react the way they are supposed to react. Last week,
nobody who was analyzing the coming war in Ukraine imagined that the
personal bravery of the Ukrainian president and his emotive calls for
sovereignty and democracy could alter the calculations of foreign ministers,
bank directors, business executives, and thousands of ordinary people. Few
imagined that the Russian president's sinister television appearances and
brutal orders could alter, in just a few days, international perceptions of
Russia.

And yet all of that has happened. Volodymyr Zelensky's courage has moved
people, even the hard-bitten CEOs of oil companies, even dull diplomats
accustomed to rote pronouncements. Vladimir Putin's paranoid ranting,
meanwhile, has frightened even people who were lauding his savvy just a few
days ago. He is not, in fact, someone you can do business with, as so many
in Berlin, Paris, London, and Washington falsely believed; he is a
cold-blooded dictator happy to murder hundreds of thousands of neighbors and
impoverish his nation, if that's what it takes to remain in power. However
the war ends -- and many scenarios are still imaginable -- we already live
in a world with fewer illusions.

Look at Germany, a nation that has spent nearly 80 years defining its
national self-interest in purely economic terms. If the government of some
distant place where Germans buy and sell things was repressive, that was
never the Germans' fault. If military aggression was reshaping the outer
borders of Europe, that was peripheral to Germany, too. Former Chancellor
Angela Merkel, although she talked a lot about liberal and democratic
values, in practice worried far more about creating good conditions for
German business, wherever it was operating. That economy-first attitude
infected her nation. Not long after the Russian annexation of Crimea in
2014, I joined a panel discussion in Germany about ``the greatest threats to
Europe.''  Because of the timing, I talked about Russia and assumed the
others would too. I was wrong. One of the other panelists called me a
warmonger. Another argued vociferously that the greatest threat was a
proposed trade agreement that would have allowed Americans to sell chicken
washed in chlorine to German supermarkets.

I remember that detail because I hadn't known about the great
chlorinated-chicken discussion that was then engulfing Germany, and I had to
go home and look it up. But I've had some version of that experience many
times since. I was on a German television program two weeks ago, along with
three German politicians who were, even then, arguing that -- despite the
thousands of troops and armored vehicles gathering on the borders of Ukraine
-- the only conceivable solution was dialog.

On Saturday, in a 30-minute speech, the current German chancellor, Olaf
Scholz, threw all of that out the window. Germany, he said, needs ``planes
that fly, ships that sail, and soldiers who are optimally equipped for their
missions.''  Germany's military should reflect its size and importance.  The
German government has done an about-face and will even send weapons to
Ukraine: 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles. More incredibly,
this 180-degree turn has the support of an astonishing 78 percent of the
German public, who now say they support much higher military spending and
will gladly pay for it. This is a fundamental change in Germany's definition
of itself, in its understanding of its past: Finally, Germans have
understood that the lesson of their history is not that Germany must remain
forever pacifist. The lesson is that Germany must defend democracy and fight
the modern version of fascism in Europe when it emerges.

But the Germans are not the only ones who have changed. Across Europe people
are realizing that they live on a continent where war, in their own time, in
their own countries, is no longer impossible. Platitudes about European
*unity* and *solidarity* are beginning to have some meaning, along with
*common foreign policy*, a phrase that, in the European Union, has until now
been largely fiction. In theory the EU has a single spokesperson for foreign
policy, but in practice European leaders have given that job to people who
know little about Russia, and whose fallback position when Russia misbehaves
is always the expression of *deep concern*.  The previous European high
representative for foreign policy, Federica Mogherini, was more interested
in EU relations with Cuba than with Kyiv. The current holder of that office,
Josep Borrell, stumbled through a meeting with his Russian counterpart last
year, and seemed surprised to be treated with disdain.

But now everything is suddenly different.  *Deep concern* has been exchanged
for real action. Less than a week into the invasion, the EU has not only
announced harsh sanctions on Russian banks, companies, and individuals --
sanctions that will also affect Europeans -- but has also offered $500
million of military aid to Ukraine. Individual European states, from France
to Finland, are sending weapons as well, and applying their own
sanctions. The French say they are drawing up a list of Russian oligarchs'
assets, including luxury cars and yachts, in order to seize them.

Europeans have also dropped, abruptly, some of their doubts about Ukraine's
membership in their institutions. On Monday, the European Parliament not
only asked Zelensky to speak, by video, but gave him a standing
ovation. Earlier today the parliamentarians, from all across the continent,
voted to accept his application for EU membership for Ukraine. Accession to
the EU is a long process, and it won't happen immediately, even if Ukraine
emerges intact from this conflict. But the idea has been broached. It is now
part of the continent's collective imagination. From being a distant place,
badly understood, it is now part of what people mean when they say Europe.

Ukraine itself will never be the same again either. Events are happening so
rapidly, with moods and emotions changing every hour of every day, that I
can't guess what will happen next, or predict how people will feel about
it. But I am certain that the events of this week have changed not only the
world's perceptions of Ukraine, but Ukrainians' perceptions of
themselves. In the long run-up to this war, the conversation in Washington
and Berlin was always focused on Putin and Joe Biden, Sergei Lavrov and
Antony Blinken, NATO and Russia. This was the kind of talk that academics
and pundits liked: big topics, big countries. In this conversation Ukraine
was, as the political scientist John Mearsheimer put it in 2014, nothing
more than ``a buffer state of enormous strategic importance to Russia.''
But the Ukrainians have now put themselves at the heart of the story, and
they know it.

As a result, thousands of people are making choices that they too could not
have imagined two weeks ago. Ukrainian sociologists, baristas, rappers, and
bakers are joining the territorial army. Villagers are standing in front of
Russian tanks, shouting *occupiers* and *murderers* at Russian soldiers
firing into the air. Construction workers on lucrative contracts in Poland
are dropping their tools and taking the train back home to join the
resistance. A decade's worth of experience fighting Russian propaganda is
finally paying off, as Ukrainians create their own counternarrative on
social media. They post videos telling Russian soldiers to go home to their
mothers. They interview captured teenage Russian conscripts, and put the
video clips online. Electronic highway signs leading into Kyiv have been
reconfigured to tell the Russian army to f*ck off.  Even if this ends badly,
even if there is more bloodshed, every Ukrainian who lived through this
moment will always remember what it felt like to resist -- and that too will
matter, for decades to come.

And what about Russia? Is Russia condemned always to be a revanchist state,
a backward-looking former empire, forever scheming to regain its old role?
Must this enormous, complicated, paradoxical nation always be ruled badly,
with cruelty, by elites who want to steal its wealth or oppress its people?
Will Russian rulers always dream of conquest instead of prosperity?

Right now many Russians don't even realize what is happening in
Ukraine. State television has not yet admitted that the Russian military has
attacked Kyiv with rockets, bombed a Holocaust memorial, or destroyed parts
of central Kharkiv and Mariupol. Instead, the official propagandists are
telling Russians that they are carrying out a police action in Ukraine's
far-eastern provinces. The audience gets no information about casualties, or
war damage, or costs. The extent of the sanctions has not been
reported. Pictures seen around the world -- the bombing of the Kyiv
television tower today, for example -- can't be seen on the Russian evening
news.

Subject: Ukraine's Vital Tech Industry Carries on Amid Russian Invasion
 (Sam Schechner)

Sam Schechner, *The Wall Street Journal*, 02 Mar 2022,
via ACM TechNews; 4 Mar 2022

Many software developers in Ukraine continue to produce code for overseas
clients amid the Russian invasion. Many also are volunteering for the ad hoc
hacking army launching cyberattacks against Russia. Some Ukrainian
technology companies are relocating employees to the west, donating money to
the war effort, or offering office space as refugee housing, among other
things. Said Tufts University's Bhaskar Chakravorti, "There is a serious
talent crunch in IT, especially at the higher end where Ukraine was
increasingly going. It's hard to imagine there will be too many other places
for clients to go." Stepan Veselovskyi of the Lviv IT Cluster trade group
said most tech companies in the city are working. Veselovskyi explained,
"It's important for businesses with international clients to be alive and
pay taxes and pay salaries to people in a time of war."

Subject: Google temporarily disables Google Maps live traffic data in
 Ukraine (Reuters)

Feb 27 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google confirmed on Sunday it
has temporarily disabled for Ukraine some Google Maps tools which provide
live information about traffic conditions and how busy different places are.

The company said it had taken the action of globally disabling the Google
Maps traffic layer and live information on how busy places like stores and
restaurants are in Ukraine for the safety of local communities in the
country, after consulting with sources including regional authorities.

Ukraine is facing attacks from Russian forces who invaded the country on
Thursday. As missiles fell on Ukrainian cities, nearly 400,000 civilians,
mainly women and children, have fled into neighbouring countries.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a "special operation".

Big tech companies including Google have said they are taking new measures
to protect users' security in the region.

Online services and social media sites have also been tapped by researchers
piecing together activity around the war.

A professor at California's Middlebury Institute of International Studies
said Google Maps helped him track a "traffic jam" that was actually Russian
movement towards the border hours before Russian President Vladimir Putin
announced the attack.
<https://twitter.com/ArmsControlWonk/status/1496657816740036616?s=20&t=hC8JFkNUIhsbBo9ML48CbQ>

Google said live traffic information remained available to drivers using
its turn-by-turn navigation features in the area.

Subject: Conti Ransomware Source Code Leaked by Ukrainian Researcher
 (Bleeping Computer)

Lawrence Abrams, BleepingComputer (1 March 2022),
via ACM TechNews; 4 Mar 2022

A Ukrainian researcher has exposed a wealth of content on the Conti
cybercrime gang, including their ransomware's source code, after they sided
with Russia on the Ukraine incursion. Known on Twitter as @ContiLeaks, the
researcher leaked 393 JavaScript Object Notation files containing roughly
60,000 internal messages from the Conti and Ryuk ransomware group's private
Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol chat server. ContiLeaks then
released more damaging material: the most exciting disclosure was a
password-protected archive featuring the source code for the Conti
ransomware encryptor, decryptor, and builder. Another researcher cracked the
password, making the ransomware source code accessible to everyone.

Subject: The Internet and Putin's War

It's impossible to overstate the importance of the Internet in Russia's war
on Ukraine. Yes, it can be a source for lies and disinformation, but it also
allows the world to monitor the conflict and organize against Putin in ways
that never would be possible before.  Putin can't hide.

Mainstream media seems to suddenly realize that Big Tech is incredibly
important to let the world know what is REALLY going on during events like
Putin's war, and that the "All Big Tech is Evil" mantra is a bunch of hooey.

Subject: Re: New Bill Would Bring Mobile Voting To WashDC (RISKS-33.07)

I wonder why I've never seen the following discussed:

* Of course, for people for whom the anonymity of their vote is paramount
  (and there really are such people, and some of them have objectively
  provable reasons why), a secure-enough but not-anonymous system wouldn't
  work.

* But, for anyone (like, say, me) for whom the anonymity of their vote isn't
  relevant (#1 anybody knowing my vote would have no blowback on me, and #2
  my votes are pretty predictable...) having a secure-enough and
  not-anonymous system would be a great convenience.

So, we should do it, and/but we should NOT ONLY do it (that is, it shouldn't
be forced on people, just made available).

The real problem is that programmers write printf("foo") to print the string
"foo", and it works.  So then they go on to write printf(str) to write the
string str, which mostly works but fails when the string pointed at by str
contains percent characters.

The first argument to printf is *supposed* to be the format string.  To
print an arbitrary string the programmer is supposed to write printf("%s",
str).
