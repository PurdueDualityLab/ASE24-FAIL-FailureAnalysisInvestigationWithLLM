  (via ACM TechNews, Friday, October 24, 2014)

Experts are coming to a consensus that the shift from the petascale to the
exascale supercomputing eras is going to be more challenging than many
previously anticipated.  At the recent Argonne National Laboratory Training
Program in Extreme Scale Computing, Pete Beckman, director of Argonne's
Exascale Technology and Computing Institute, highlighted some of the
possible problems.  One major concern is power and the costs associated with
it.  Although supercomputers have been getting more energy-efficient,
Beckman uses the example of the most recent generations of IBM
supercomputers to demonstrate a 5x trajectory of energy efficiency gains
that would still have an exascale system requiring 64 megawatts of power,
which could cost tens of millions of dollars a year.  These cost concerns
are prompting many countries to pursue exascale computing on an
international scale, forming multinational partnerships to share the massive
costs.  The U.S. and Japan recently entered such an agreement, and Europe is
looking to join them.  However, China is proceeding on its own, largely on
the strength of its own native technology.  Beckman also addressed
challenges relating to memory and resilience and the need to update software
to be able to make use of exascale resources.

Subject: Dangers of an IT monoculture

A recent paper in a medical journal raises ()concerns about the emergence of
an IH 'monoculture' in healthcare.  But, the paper misses IMHO the most
significant risk of a monoculture -- that it increases the magnitude of the
inevitable failures.  In agriculture and ecosystems, monocultures lead to
the more rapid spread of pests and diseases, and are more vulnerable to
catastrophic collapse, particularly when conditions change.  In a
heterogeneous population of EHRs, the occasional failure of any given system
due to hidden bugs, vulnerabilities, hacking, or unexpected interactions
with the conditions of use would create major problems for individual
institutions or work systems (e.g., see RISKS-23.19, 23.81, 24.68, 25.45,
25.51, 26.25, 28.3) but its impact would be limited.  However, if a large
proportion of systems all contain the same vulnerability ... what could
possibly go wrong?  The original paper available at:

Subject: IoT as a Hazard (IaaH): Smart Meters prove vulnerable

It should not be surprising. While the Internet of Things (IoT) has great
promise, widely-deployed, connected devices are an attractive target for all
kinds of mischief.  SecurityAffairs reports that Javier Vazquez Vidal and
Alberto Garcia Illera explored smart power meters used in Spain. They found
that they could be hacked, and exploited in a number of ways (e.g.,
transferring usage, reporting false data).  The lack of integrity in such
devices also raises the possibility that large numbers of compromised
devices could be used to present a false picture to utility operators,
compromising the operation of the utility's production and transmission
facilities. A profoundly disturbing picture.  Meters and other devices also
represent a potential privacy hazard to the individual.  The full article

Subject: Hackers' Attack Cracked 10 Financial Firms in Major Assault (NYT)

Matthew Goldstein, Nicole Perlroth and David E. Sanger, *The New York Times*,
3 Oct 2014

The huge cyberattack on JPMorgan Chase that touched more than 83 million
households and businesses was one of the most serious computer intrusions
into an American corporation. But it could have been much worse.

Questions over who the hackers are and the approach of their attack concern
government and industry officials. Also troubling is that about nine other
financial institutions - a number that has not been previously reported -
were also infiltrated by the same group of overseas hackers, according to
people briefed on the matter. The hackers are thought to be operating from
Russia and appear to have at least loose connections with officials of the
Russian government, the people briefed on the matter said. ...

Subject: The Unpatchable Malware That Infects USBs Is Now on the Loose
  (Andy Greenberg)

Andy Greenberg, *WiReD*, 2 Oct 2014

It's been just two months since researcher Karsten Nohl demonstrated an
attack he called BadUSB to a standing-room-only crowd at the Black Hat
security conference in Las Vegas, showing that it's possible to corrupt any
USB device with insidious, undetectable malware. Given the severity of that
security problem-and the lack of any easy patch-Nohl has held back on
releasing the code he used to pull off the attack. But at least two of
Nohl's fellow researchers aren't waiting any longer.

In a talk at the Derbycon hacker conference in Louisville, Kentucky last
week, researchers Adam Caudill and Brandon Wilson showed that they've
reverse engineered the same USB firmware as Nohl's SR Labs, reproducing some
of Nohl's BadUSB tricks. And unlike Nohl, the hacker pair has also published
the code for those attacks on Github, raising the stakes for USB makers to
either fix the problem or leave hundreds of millions of users vulnerable. ...

Subject: ComputerCOP: dubious "Internet Safety Software" given to US families

Ars via NNSquad
http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/10/computercop-the-dubious-internet-safety-software-given-to-families-nationwide/

  Police chiefs, sheriffs, and district attorneys have handed out hundreds
  of thousands of copies of the disc to parents for free at schools,
  libraries, and community events, usually as a part of an "Internet Safety"
  outreach initiative. (You can see the long list of ComputerCOP outlets
  here.) The packaging typically features the agency's official seal and the
  chief's portrait, with a signed message warning of the "dark and dangerous
  off-ramps" of the Internet.  As official as it looks, ComputerCOP is
  actually just spyware, generally bought in bulk from a New York company
  that appears to do nothing but market this software to local government
  agencies using shady information.  The way ComputerCOP works is neither
  safe nor secure. It isn't particularly effective either, except for
  generating positive PR for the law enforcement agencies distributing
  it. As security software goes, we observed a product with a
  keystroke-capturing function, also called a "keylogger," that could place
  a family's personal information at extreme risk by transmitting those
  keystoke logs over the Internet to third-party servers without
  encryption. That means many versions of ComputerCOP leave children (and
  their parents, guests, friends, and anyone using the affected computer)
  exposed to the same predators, identity thieves, and bullies that police
  claim the software protects against.  Furthermore, by providing a free
  keylogging program--software that operates without even the most basic
  security safeguards--law enforcement agencies are passing around what
  amounts to a spying tool that could easily be abused by people who want to
  snoop on spouses, roommates, or co-workers.

I was planning on spec'ing a quantity of Samsung printers for a client. We
bought a sample. The Mac driver installed OK, but the Windows one had a very
disturbing message during installation: Samsung was going to sniff the
printer's output, to {of course} better serve the customer. [I paraphrase
slightly....]

Needless to say, I was far from pleased. I tried to disallow same during the
installation, but got no confirmation that it happened.

{I can guess Samsung does not sell many printers to either Ft. Meade or
Langley.}

I've tried to reach someone at Samsung's printer division but got nowhere;
Support does not see it as their potato, and Sales's voicemail said they

Frank Pasquale, *The New York Times* op-ed, 16 Oct 2014
http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/opinion/the-dark-market-for-personal-data.html

The reputation business is exploding. Having eroded privacy for decades,
shady, poorly regulated data miners, brokers and resellers have now taken
creepy classification to a whole new level.  They have created lists of
victims of sexual assault, and lists of people with sexually transmitted
diseases. Lists of people who have Alzheimer's, dementia and AIDS. Lists of
the impotent and the depressed.

There are lists of impulse buyers. Lists of suckers: gullible consumers who
have shown that they are susceptible to vulnerability-based marketing.  And
lists of those deemed commercially undesirable because they live in or near
trailer parks or nursing homes. Not to mention lists of people who have been
accused of wrongdoing, even if they were not charged or convicted.

Typically sold at a few cents per name, the lists don't have to be
particularly reliable to attract eager buyers -- mostly marketers, but also,
increasingly, financial institutions vetting customers to guard against
fraud, and employers screening potential hires.

There are three problems with these lists. First, they are often
inaccurate. For example, as The Washington Post reported, an Arkansas woman
found her credit history and job prospects wrecked after she was mistakenly
listed as a methamphetamine dealer. It took her years to clear her name and
find a job.

Second, even when the information is accurate, many of the lists have no
business being in the hands of retailers, bosses or banks. Having a medical
condition, or having been a victim of a crime, is simply not relevant to
most employment or credit decisions.

Third, people aren't told they are on these lists, so they have no
opportunity to correct bad information. The Arkansas woman found out about
the inaccurate report only when she was denied a job. She was one of the
rare ones.  [...]

Subject: Seeing where the last taxi passenger went

On a recent ride from Washington Dulles airport (IAD) to my home in the
Virginia suburbs, the cab had an Android tablet mounted to the back of the
front-seat passenger seat, running an app that allowed you to see the
weather, driver information, etc.  But the most interesting thing was that
it allowed you to enter your destination in Google Maps, which is useful for
drivers who may not know the area and/or whose English isn't the best.

A tool like this could be particularly useful if it allowed input in
multiple languages -- i.e., allow a Japanese visitor to enter their
destination in Japanese; similarly if such a thing were in a taxi in Japan,
it would be useful to allow an English-speaking visitor to enter their
destination in English.  [Perhaps such things already exist; I haven't seen
one.]

However, the part that gave me slight pause was that in the destination
field, I could see the most recent half dozen destinations that cab had
gone, and there was no (obvious) way to clear destinations if I entered
mine.

At one level, this isn't a big deal -- if the cab had been on the street,
then the most recent destination was presumably near where I got it.  On the
other hand, if the driver was being dispatched, the recent destinations
might be places where the driver had recently picked up passengers, and
hence likely empty homes.

One could also hypothesize interesting things one might learn -- if one sees
a politician getting out of a cab, one might be interested in where he/she
was coming from - i.e., from a lobbyist's office or a secret lover's
hideaway.

But all this depends on getting just the right timing - finding the right
person coming out of the cab, and getting in before another passenger.

Overall, I think the risk is low, but it might be surprising to taxi
customers that a future customer can find out where they went.

http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/10/7-million-dropbox-usernamepassword-pairs-apparently-leaked/

  "Popular online locker service Dropbox appears to have been hacked. A
  series of posts have been made to Pastebin purporting to contain login

  that altogether 6,937,081 account credentials have been compromised.
  Reddit users who have tested some of the leaked credentials have confirmed
  that at least some of them work. Dropbox seems to have bulk reset all the

LATER Update: Dropbox is saying that this is not a hack per se, but rather a

a lot of problems if you share your passwords between services and don't

Subject: This POODLE bites: exploiting the SSL 3.0 fallback

Google via NNSquad
http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com.au/2014/10/this-poodle-bites-exploiting-ssl-30.html

  "Today we are publishing details of a vulnerability in the design of SSL
  version 3.0. This vulnerability allows the plaintext of secure connections
  to be calculated by a network attacker. I discovered this issue in
  collaboration with Thai Duong and Krzysztof Kotowicz (also Googlers).  SSL
  3.0 is nearly 15 years old, but support for it remains widespread. Most
  importantly, nearly all browsers support it and, in order to work around
  bugs in HTTPS servers, browsers will retry failed connections with older
  protocol versions, including SSL 3.0. Because a network attacker can cause
  connection failures, they can trigger the use of SSL 3.0 and then exploit
  this issue."

Subject: Re: Firedrive and Cloudflare

The recent firedrive.com outage has triggered several messages to RISKS that
have pointed a finger at Cloudflare as a culpable party, because the IP
address for firedrive.com matches IP addresses also owned by
Cloudflare. While the latter is true (firedrive.com is in Cloudflare's IP
space), this does not actually imply Cloudflare involvement, complacency, or
responsibility.

Cloudflare is a Content Distribution Network (CDN). Basically, this means
that they host no data at all -- they sell distribution services, much the
same way a phone company does (though a better analogue might be an
answering service). Companies (like Firedrive) pay Cloudflare to proxy
incoming traffic for them, and cache the parts of that data that can be
cached, as a way to offload traffic from their own servers, and make their
websites more responsive to their users.

Blaming Cloudflare, in this case, is like blaming an answering service
because your doctor's office isn't picking up their phone. No matter how
much you beg, the answering service can't help you with that funny looking
mole you just discovered -- all they can do is pass on your requests, and
hope that your doctor responds.

Cloudflare is just an intermediary here.

The real risk (beyond the mis-attribution of problems) is the continued
belief that "the cloud" is some kind of magic sauce that relieves you of
responsibility for the safety of your data (i.e. keeping backups). Any given
cloud provider is a place you can store data, but cloud providers can fail,
just like physical media can. Storing your important data on a single cloud
provider is akin to storing your important data on a single hard drive. You
/probably/ won't have a failure that causes you to lose data, but cloud
providers (like hard drives) are fallible, and I seriously doubt that this
will be the last major failure of a cloud storage company.

Two words: "Erasure Code":

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code

"In information theory, an erasure code is a forward error correction (FEC)
code for the binary erasure channel, which transforms a message of k symbols
into a longer message (code word) with n symbols such that the original
message can be recovered from a subset of the n symbols"

Aka RAIC -- Redundant Array of Independent Clouds
