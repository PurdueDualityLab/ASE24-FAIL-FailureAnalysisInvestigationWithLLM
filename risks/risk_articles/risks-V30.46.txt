Subject: Equifax Hack May Expose Data of 143 Million Users (Polly Mosendz) 

Polly Mosendz, Bloomberg, 8 Sep 2017 
Class action seeking to represent 143 million consumers alleges company 
didn't spend enough on protecting data. 
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-08/equifax-sued-over-massive-hack-in-multibillion-dollar-lawsuit 

A proposed class-action lawsuit was filed against Equifax Inc. late Thursday 
evening, shortly after the company reported that an unprecedented hack had 
compromised the private information of about 143 million people. 

In the complaint filed in Portland, Ore., federal court, users alleged 
Equifax was negligent in failing to protect consumer data, choosing to save 
money instead of spending on technical safeguards that could have stopped 
the attack. Data revealed included Social Security numbers, addresses, 
driver's license data, and birth dates. Some credit card information was 
also put at risk. 

Equifax first discovered the vulnerability in late July, though it chose not 
to announce it publicly until more than a month later. The company was 
widely criticized for its customer service approach in the aftermath of the 
hack, as users struggled to understand whether their information had been 
affected. Others expressed frustration that three senior executives sold 
about $1.7 million in stock in the days following the discovery of the 
hack. A spokeswoman for Equifax said the men “had no knowledge that an 
intrusion had occurred at the time.” 

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit are Mary McHill and Brook Reinhard. Both 
reside in Oregon and had their personal information stored by Equifax. 

“In an attempt to increase profits, Equifax negligently failed to maintain 
adequate technological safeguards to protect Ms. McHill and Mr. Reinhard's 
information from unauthorized access by hackers,” the complaint 
stated. “Equifax knew and should have known that failure to maintain 
adequate technological safeguards would eventually result in a massive data 
breach. Equifax could have and should have substantially increased the 
amount of money it spent to protect against cyberattacks but chose not to.” 

The case was filed by the firm Olsen Daines PC along with Geragos & Geragos, 
a celebrity law firm known for blockbuster class actions. Ben Meiselas, an 
attorney for Geragos, said the class will seek as much as $70 billion in 
damages nationally.

Subject: More info on Equifax breach 

There is increasing evidence to suggest that primary impacts of the Equifax 
breach involve consumers who interacted directly with (and provided personal 
information to) their public facing website. The breach does not appear at 
this time to involve their core credit reporting databases.

  What this means is not only are none of the last names tied to your Social 
  Security number, but there's no way to tell if you were really impacted. 
  It's clear Equifax's goal isn't to protect the consumer or bring them 
  vital information.  It's to get you to sign up for its revenue-generating 
  product TrustID.

Subject: Hurricane Harvey Knocked Out Cell Service.  Now Calls for Backup 
  Wireless Power Are Rising 

via NNSquad 
http://fortune.com/2017/08/30/hurricane-harvey-cell-backup-power/ 

  The wireless industry has for years successfully fought regulations that 
  would force mobile phone networks to be hardened so they work during 
  storms, but it may face renewed demands after Hurricane Harvey knocked out 
  seven of 10 cell towers in the hardest-hit counties of Texas. 

Depending on cell service during a disaster is a disaster in and of itself. 
That's why so many telecom experts hang onto their landlines as lifelines! I 
sure as hell do!

  (Vindu Goel and Scott Shane) 

Vindu Goel and Scott Shane, The New York Times, 6 Sep 2017 

Providing new evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election, 
Facebook disclosed on Wednesday that it had identified more than $100,000 
worth of divisive ads on hot-button issues purchased by a shadowy Russian 
company linked to the Kremlin.  The fake accounts were created by a Russian 
company called the Internet Research Agency" (which is known for using troll 
accounts to post on social media and comment on news websites).

Siva Vaidhyanathan, The New York Times, 8 Sep 2017 [via Dave Farber] 

Wait! 

Facebook, unlike Twitter, does not allow puppets, i.e. accounts controlled 
by other accounts. I recall Egyptian Spring activists complaining about 
this. 

Does Facebook allow ads, i.e. something paid for, to masquerade as unpaid 
posts? It shouldn't; Google doesn't. Finally, any ad should allow its reader 
to learn about who paid for it. 

None of these rules would prevent Russian robot trolls from posting evil 
ideas, but it would make detecting them easier. A skeptical reader could ask 
"Who posted this, and who are their friends?"

Subject: Virginia scraps touchscreen voting machines (Morgan Chalfant) 

Morgan Chalfant, *The Hill*, 9 Sep 2017, via Dave Farber 
http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/349896-virginia-scraps-touchscreen-voting-machines 

The Virginia State Board of Elections moved Friday to do away with 
touchscreen voting machines in the state by November's election, a move 
aimed at boosting security. 

The board decided to phase out the machines this year after the Virginia 
Department of Elections recommended that the touchscreen voting machines be 
decertified. The recommendation came after security experts breached 
numerous types of voting machines with ease at the DEF CON cybersecurity 
conference in Las Vegas in July, according to The Richmond Times-Dispatch. 

The move comes amid heightened concerns over foreign interference in future 
elections, in light of the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that 
Russia used cyberattacks and disinformation to interfere in the 2016 
presidential election. 

Virginia's gubernatorial election will take place in November, meaning that 
the move to get rid of the machines would result in 22 localities having to 
replace their equipment less than two months before the vote. 

The state has already passed a law mandating that the machines be phased 
out by 2020. According to the Times-Dispatch, 10 localities have already 
started purchasing new equipment. The remaining 12 would need to work 
quickly to phase out the old equipment by Nov. 7. 

``The security of the election process is always of paramount importance. 
The Department is continually vigilant on matters related to security of 
voting equipment used in Virginia,'' Edgardo Cortes, the state's election 
commissioner, said in a news release Friday.  ``The ability to meaningfully 
participate in our democracy is one of the most important rights that we 
have as citizens, and the Department of Elections is dedicated to 
maintaining voters' confidence in the democratic process.'' 

Cyber-experts have raised alarm over the touchscreen devices, called 
direct-recording electronic, or DRE, voting machines, because they yield no 
paper records that can be checked with the electronic records to make sure 
votes are tallied accurately. 

More than 100 cyber- and voting experts penned a letter to Congress in June 
urging them to take steps to secure future elections, including a 
recommendation to phase out DRE voting machines and others that do not 
produce a voter-verified paper ballot. 

``While there has been encouraging progress to improve election security in 
recent years, too many polling stations across the nation are still equipped 
with electronic machines that do not produce voter-verified paper ballots, 
Many jurisdictions are also inadequately prepared to deal with rising 
cybersecurity risks.'' 

The letter was sent the day that Department of Homeland Security officials 
testified of evidence that Russia targeted election-related systems in 21 
states ahead of the 2016 presidential election. 

While officials maintain that the systems targeted were not involved in vote 
tallying, Moscow's interference campaign has nevertheless stoked fears about 
the possibility that foreign actors could attempt to use hacking to affect 
vote counts in the future.

Subject: A huge solar flare temporarily knocked out GPS communications 
  (Engadget) 

The sun did its biggest burp in 12 years.  On the morning of 6 September the 
sun let out two pretty sizable burps of radiation. Both were considered 
X-class -- the strongest type of solar flare -- with one of them proving to 
be the most powerful since 2005. If a solar flare is directed at Earth, 
which these ones were, it can generate a radiation storm that interferes 
with radio and GPS signals. The biggest flare ever recorded, in 2003, was so 
strong it even knocked out NASA's solar measurement equipment. These recent 
belches weren't quite on par with that, but they were enough to jam high 
frequency radios and interfere with GPS systems for about an hour on the 
side of the Earth facing the sun. Put your hand over your mouth, sun! Rude!

  design. Apple and Google patched a similar flaw in Safari (CVE-2017-2419) 
  and Chrome (CVE-2017-5033), respectively.
