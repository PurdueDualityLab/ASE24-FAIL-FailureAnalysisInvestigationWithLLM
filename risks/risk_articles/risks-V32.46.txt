Subject: FAA Files Reveal a Surprising Threat to Airline Safety: the
  U.S. Military's GPS Tests (IEEE Spectrum)

*Military tests that jam and spoof GPS signals are an accident waiting to
happen*

Early one morning last May, a commercial airliner was approaching El Paso
International Airport, in West Texas, when a warning popped up in the
cockpit: *GPS Position Lost*. The pilot contacted the airline's operations
center and received a report that the U.S. Army's White Sands Missile Range
<https://www.wsmr.army.mil/Pages/home.aspx>, in South Central New Mexico,
was disrupting the GPS signal. ``We knew then that it was not an aircraft
GPS fault,'' the pilot wrote later.

The pilot missed an approach on one runway due to high winds, then came
around to try again. ``We were forced to Runway 04 with a predawn landing
with no access to [an instrument landing] with vertical guidance,'' the
pilot wrote. ``Runway 04 has a high CFIT threat due to the climbing terrain
in the local area.''

CFIT stands for ``controlled flight into terrain,'' and it is exactly as
serious as it sounds. The pilot considered diverting to Albuquerque, 370
kilometers away, but eventually bit the bullet and tackled Runway 04 using
only visual aids. The plane made it safely to the ground, but the pilot
later logged the experience on NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System
<https://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/>, a forum where pilots can anonymously share
near misses and safety tips.

This is far from the most worrying ASRS report involving GPS jamming. In
August 2018, a passenger aircraft in Idaho, flying in smoky conditions,
reportedly suffered GPS interference from military tests and was saved from
crashing into a mountain only by the last-minute intervention of an air
traffic controller. ``Loss of life can happen because air traffic control
and a flight crew believe their equipment are working as intended, but are
in fact leading them into the side of the mountain,'' wrote the controller.
``Had [we] not noticed, that flight crew and the passengers would be dead. I
have no doubt.''.  [...]

Subject: AI-powered text from this program could fool the government
  (Will Knight)

  [via Dave Farber]

Volunteers couldn't tell AI-generated comments from those penned by humans.
Will Knight, Ars Technica, 17 Jan 2021
https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/ai-powered-text-from-this-program-could-fool-the-government/

In October 2019, Idaho proposed changing its Medicaid program. The state
needed approval from the federal government, which solicited public feedback
via Medicaid.gov.

Roughly 1,000 comments arrived. But half came not from concerned citizens or
even Internet trolls. They were generated by artificial intelligence. And a
study found that people could not distinguish the real comments from the
fake ones.

The project was the work of Max Weiss, a tech-savvy medical student at
Harvard, but it received little attention at the time. Now, with AI language
systems advancing rapidly, some say the government and Internet companies
need to rethink how they solicit and screen feedback to guard against
deepfaketext manipulation and other AI-powered interference.

``The ease with which a bot can generate and submit relevant text that
impersonates human speech on government websites is surprising and really
important to know,'' says Latanya Sweeney, a professor at Harvard's Kennedy
School who advised Weiss on how to run the experiment ethically.  Sweeney
says the problems extend well beyond government services, but it is
imperative that public agencies find a solution. ``AI can drown speech from
real humans,'' she says. ``Government websites have to change.''

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says it has added new
safeguards to the public comment system in response to Weiss's study,
though it declines to discuss specifics. Weiss says he was contacted by the
US General Services Administration, which is developing a new version of the
federal government website for publishing regulations and comments, about
ways to better protect it from fake comments.

Government systems have been the target of automated influence campaigns
before. In 2017, researchers discovered that over a million comments
submitted to the Federal Communications Commission regarding plans to roll
back net neutrality rules had been auto-generated, with certain phrases
copied and pasted into different messages.

Weiss's project highlights a more serious threat. There has been remarkable
progress in applying AI to language over the past few years. When powerful
machine-learning algorithms are fed huge amounts of training data=94in the
form of books and text scraped from the Web=94they can produce programs
capable of generating convincing text. Besides myriad useful applications,
this raises the prospect that all sorts of Internet messages, comments, and
posts could be faked easily and less detectably.

``As technology gets better,'' Sweeney says, ``human speech venues become
subject to manipulation without human knowledge that it has happened.''
Weiss was working at a health care consumer-advocacy organization in the
summer of 2019 when he learned about the public feedback process required to
make Medicaid changes. Knowing that these public comments had swayed
previous efforts to change state Medicaid programs, Weiss looked for tools
that could auto-generate comments.

``I was a bit shocked when I saw nothing more than a submit button standing
in the way of your comment becoming a part of the public record,'' he says.

Weiss discovered GPT-2, a program released earlier that year by OpenAI, an
AI company in San Francisco, and realized he could generate fake comments to
simulate a groundswell of public opinion. ``I was also shocked at how easy
it was to fine tune GPT-2 to actually spit out the comments,'' Weiss
says. ``It's relatively concerning on a number of fronts.''

Besides the comment-generating tool, Weiss built software for automatically
submitting comments. He also conducted an experiment in which volunteers
were asked to distinguish between the AI-generated comments and ones written
by humans. The volunteers did no better than random guessing.

After submitting the comments, Weiss notified the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services. He had added a few characters to make it easy to identify
each fake comment. Even so, he says, the AI feedback remained posted online
for several months.

GPT-3

OpenAI released a more capable version of its text-generation program,
called GPT-3, last June. So far, it has only been made available to a few AI
researchers and companies, with some people building useful applications
such as programs that generate email messages from bullet points. When GPT-3
was released, OpenAI said in a research paper that it had not seen signs of
GPT-2 being used maliciously, even though it had been aware of Weiss's
research.

OpenAI and other researchers have released a few tools capable of
identifying AI-generated text. These use similar AI algorithms to spot
telltale signs in the text. It's not clear if anyone is using these to
protect online commenting platforms. Facebook declined to say if it is using
such tools; Google and Twitter did not respond to requests for comment.

It also isn't clear if sophisticated AI tools are yet being used to create
fake content. In August, researchers at Google posted details of an
experiment that used deepfake-text-detection tools to analyze over 500
million webpages. They found that the tools could identify pages hosting
auto-generated text and spam. But it wasn't clear if any of the content was
made using an AI tool such as GPT-2.

Subject: No stopping AI? Scientists conclude there would be no way to
  control super-intelligent machines (Study Finds)

From self-driving cars to computers that can win game shows, humans have a
natural curiosity and interest in artificial intelligence (AI). As
scientists continue making machines smarter and smarter however, some are
asking ``what happens when computers get too smart for their own good?''
From The Matrix to The Terminator, the entertainment industry has already
started pondering if future robots will one day threaten the human race.
Now, a new study concludes there may be no way to stop the rise of
machines. An international team says humans would not be able to prevent
super artificial intelligence from doing whatever it wanted to.

Scientists from the Center for Humans and Machines at the Max Planck
Institute have started to picture what such a machine would look like.
Imagine an AI program with an intelligence far superior to humans. So much
so that it could learn on its own without new programming. If it was
connected to the Internet, researchers say the AI would have access to all
of humanity's data and could even take control of other machines around the
globe.

Study authors ask what would such an intelligence
<https://www.studyfinds.org/human-brains-computer-see-objects/> do with all
that power? Would it work to make all of our lives better? Would it devote
its processing power to fixing issues like climate change? Or, would the

Subject: DNSpooq Lets Attackers Poison DNS Cache Records (Catalin Cimpanu)

Catalin Cimpanu, ZDNet, 19 Jan 2021 via ACM TechNews, 25 Jan 2021

Researchers in Israeli boutique cybersecurity consultancy JSOF have
disclosed seven vulnerabilities that affect Dnsmasq, a domain name system
(DNS) forwarding client for *NIX-based operating systems. The
vulnerabilities involve DNSpooq software in millions of devices sold
worldwide, including networking gear like routers, access points, firewalls,
and VPNs from numerous companies. The researchers say the vulnerabilities
could be combined to poison DNS cache entries recorded by Dnsmasq servers,
allowing attackers to redirect users to clones of legitimate websites. Four
of the vulnerabilities are buffer overflows in the Dnsmasq code that could
result in remote code execution scenarios, and the remainder enable DNS
cache poisoning. The researchers advise users to apply security updates
released by the Dnsmasq project.

Subject: Re: Bursts of acceleration in Tesla vehicles caused by drivers
  mistaking accelerators for brakes ... (RISKS-32.45)

Gabe Goldberg reported *The Washington Post* on an NHTSA investigation into
crashes by Teslas. The study concluded that there was no design fault, but
rather Driver Error: Mistakenly stepping on the accelerator rather than the
brake.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/01/08/tesla-brakes/

Gabe then editorializes in the cute quip manner that has become all too
common on RISKS: "[Doesn't speak well of Tesla owners' driving skills...]."

I believe it is a Design Fault -- not just of Tesla, but of automobiles in
general and the standards committees.

Mistaken application of the accelerator pedal rather than the brake is a
reasonably frequent event in automobiles, so frequent that it even has an
acronym: SUA. Sudden Unintended Acceleration.

Why? Because the accelerator and brake pedals are adjacent, sometimes at
approximately the same height (especially loved by racers, so they can "heel
and toe" between the toe pedals rapidly.

In modern autos, there is no clutch pedal, so there is lots of room to space
the pedals differently.  There are other solutions to the placement of the
pedals, but each change will have its own perceived risks, so rather than
make suggestions only to have people point out the flaws, I say, why not
turn it over to the Human Factors engineers. Every major car manufacturer --
and even NHTSA-- employs them. Let the studies begin!  (Caveat: I'm a Fellow
of the Human Factors society, among others, so I am biased.)

I also suspect that for many of the Tesla accidents, the driver's foot was
on the floor or otherwise resting.  Why? In the Tesla (or any auto with
adaptive cruise control), there is nothing for the right foot to do.
Acceleration and appropriate speed is automatically handled by the vehicle.
Why not rest the foot. I know I do. If there suddenly is a need to brake, a
small percentage of misses is likely.

Note too that in the case of Tesla, all the SUA events did have forces
applied to the accelerator pedal (the auto has extensive record keeping), so
these were unlikely to simply be faulty automation. Of the 217 cases
examined by NHTSA. 28% were in parking lots and 12% in Driveways -- 40%!

Tesla -- and many Electric Vehicles (EVs) have a feature that can be
dangerous in this situation: Electric motors have high torque even at
startup, so the initial acceleration, even (especially) from a stopped
position can be unexpectedly rapid.  Notice that most of the cases were in
zero or low velocity situations. The NHTSA report states: "Eighty-six (86)
percent of these crashes occurred in parking lots, driveways or other
close-quarter *not-in-traffic* locations." Moreover, NHTSA says: "Almost all
of these crashes were of short duration, with crashes occurring within three
seconds of the alleged SUA event."

I don't have comparable statistics for the multiple crashes that Toyota had
due to SUA or for any of the other manufacturers who were also afflicted.

But Norman's Rule of Design is that when there are multiple, repeated
incidents of the same type of accident, even though the tendency is to blame
the person, invariably it is actually due to inappropriate design.  When I
see one or two cases, blaming the person might be appropriate. But when the
number of cases gets into the multiple hundreds, something else is going on.

It is cute to make fun of drivers, whether for their age, gender, or choice
of automobile. Cute statements often are false statements. And false
statements can cause damage and death. In the case of automobile accidents,
a false belief that incidents are caused by driver error prevents government
agencies and automobile manufacturers from believing they should do
something about it.

Please people, stop calling faulty design "human error."

(I couldn't find the NHTSA report on the NHTSA site, but it is available at
https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-sudden-acceleration-nhtsa-closes-review/ .)

Don Norman, Founding Director Emeritus, Design Lab,
University of California, San Diego USA.

  [John Levine noted that in the 1980s a bunch of unexpected acceleration
  events in Audi 100's were also due to pedal confusion. Audi recalled them
  to move the pedals farther apart and to add an interlock so you had to
  step on the brake before putting the car in gear.

  Michael Bacon noted that many air crashes have been attributed to "pilot
  error", but examination of later incidents found issues with design,
  materials, systems, construction, maintenance, inspection, manuals,
  training, operations, etc.  PGN]

The UK thinks the calculus is simple.

Firstly, it appears that 12 weeks is the optimum delay to provide the
longest protection.

Secondly, and far more importantly, while a single dose may only offer 50%
or 60% protection against infection, it DOES seem to offer *100%* protection
against hospitalisation.

No, we don't want "one shot" people getting infected and spreading it, but
the more people we can keep out of hospital, the better. (And getting
infected seems to offer 85% immunity after you've recovered.)
