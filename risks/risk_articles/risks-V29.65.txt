Multiple alleged HIPAA violations result in $2.75 million settlement with the University of Mississippi Medical Center

The University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) has agreed to settle
multiple alleged violations of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) with the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR). OCR's investigation of UMMC was
triggered by a breach of unsecured electronic protected health information
(ePHI) affecting approximately 10,000 individuals.  During the
investigation, OCR determined that UMMC was aware of risks and
vulnerabilities to its systems as far back as April 2005, yet no significant
risk management activity occurred until after the breach, due largely to
organizational deficiencies and insufficient institutional oversight. UMMC
will pay a penalty of $2,750,000 and adopt a corrective action plan to help
assure future compliance with HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach
Notification Rules.

Subject: Widespread HIPAA vulnerabilities result in $2.7 million settlement
  with Oregon Health & Science University (HHS)

Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) has agreed to settle potential
violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules following an investigation by the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR)
that found widespread and diverse problems at OHSU, which will be addressed
through a comprehensive three-year corrective action plan.  The settlement
includes a monetary payment by OHSU to the Department for $2,700,000.

OCR's investigation began after OHSU submitted multiple breach reports
affecting thousands of individuals, including two reports involving
unencrypted laptops and another large breach involving a stolen unencrypted
thumb drive.  These incidents each garnered significant local and national
press coverage. OCR's investigation uncovered evidence of widespread
vulnerabilities within OHSU's HIPAA compliance program, including the
storage of the electronic protected health information (ePHI) of over 3,000
individuals on a cloud-based server without a business associate agreement.
OCR found significant risk of harm to 1,361 of these individuals due to the
sensitive nature of their diagnoses.

Brad Chacos, Senior Editor, TechHive, PC World, 27 Jul 2016
Osram's Lightify smart bulbs suffer from several serious security flaws
Most -- but not all -- will be fixed in August, however.
http://www.pcworld.com/article/3101008/connected-home/osrams-lightify-smart-bulbs-suffer-from-several-serious-security-flaws.html

Those smart lightbulbs you installed may just be dumbing down your home
network's security, creating cracks that hackers can slip through to press
attacks.

Security firm Rapid7 posted a vulnerability report earlier this month:

  Nine issues affecting the Home or Pro versions of Osram Lightify were
  discovered, with the practical exploitation effects ranging from the
  accidental disclosure of sensitive network configuration information, to
  persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) on the web management console, to
  operational command execution on the devices themselves without
  authentication,

    [This may give new meaning to the old question of how many people does
    it take to change a lightbulb.  You might need at least a skilled sys
    admin to overcome the newly installed supposedly secure controls, a
    licensed electrician to ensure the sys admin will not be electrocuted,
    and a supervisor to ensure that no information leakage results, not to
    mention the procurers of the lightbulb and others indirectly involved.
    Of course, given the Internet of Things, the sys admin might be remotely
    working for an untrustworthy third-party company, the licensed
    electrician operating with forged certification, and the supervisor
    actually might be a robot (who would not count, even though it can
    count!?), and the lightbulb might be a counterfeit or spiked with
    special surveillance capabilities!  This has glorious opportunities for
    RISKS, and perhaps even an April Fool's item.  PGN]

Jack Goldsmith, on Whether Foreign Powers Could Hack Our Elections
Posted on ElectionLawBlog by Rick Hasen, 26 Jul 2016

Is the election aspect of this hack unique?

There have been reports in recent years of cyberattacks or cyberoperations
in computer networks in other countries related to elections. Still, if this
if a Russian (or some other foreign governmental) operation, I know of
nothing parallel on this scale, with this impact. And yet, as I wrote this
morning, ``the Russian hack of the DNC was small beans compared to the
destruction of the integrity of a national election result.''  Presumably
the DNC email hack and leak involve genuine emails. But what if the hackers
interspersed fake but even more damning or inflammatory emails that were
hard to disprove? What if hackers break in to computers to steal or destroy
voter registration information? What if they disrupted computer-based voting
or election returns in important states during the presidential election?
The legitimacy of a presidential election might be called into question,
with catastrophic consequences. The DNC hack is just the first wave* of
possible threats to electoral integrity in the United States -- by foreign
intelligence services, and others.

A key guarantee provided by HTTPS encryption is that the addresses of

The attack can be carried out by operators of just about any type of
network, including public Wi-Fi networks, which arguably are the places
where Web surfers need HTTPS the most. It works by abusing a feature known
as WPAD -- short for Web Proxy Autodisovery --in a way that exposes certain
browser requests to attacker-controlled code. The attacker then gets to see
the entire URL of every site the target visits. The exploit works against
virtually all browsers and operating systems. It will be demonstrated for

  A newly discovered set of wireless keyboard vulnerabilities can let
  hackers take over your keyboard and secretly record what you type.  It's
  called KeySniffer, and it spells death for millions of wireless,
  radio-based keyboards.  According to security researchers at Bastille, the
  so-called KeySniffer vulnerability affects wireless keyboards that use a
  less secure, radio-based communication protocol rather than a Bluetooth
  connection. The affected keyboards come from eight different hardware
  makers and use transceiver chips or non-Bluetooth chips.  These chips are
  cheaper than Bluetooth chips, but they also don't receive Bluetooth's
  frequent security updates. That's a problem.

My primary keyboards are all wired. On rare occasions, I use a Bluetooth
keyboard unaffected by this specific issue.

The problem is that the keyboards transmit to their associated PCs without

figure out how to read what keys are being hit, say Bastille researchers. An
attacker could inject keystrokes while the keyboard is idle and the machine
is logged in, they say, using a dongle that can be fashioned for less than

Samuel Gibbs, *The Guardian*, 26 Jul 2016

Tepco requests Niantic to remove Pokémon character from nuclear plant
meltdown areas and evacuation zone

Japan is asking for the Fukushima nuclear exclusion zone to be classified as
a no-go area for Pokémon after the discovery of at least one of the
game's characters on a power station's site.

Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (Tepco) has requested that
Pokémon Go developer Niantic and the Pokémon Company prevent
Pokémon appearing in and around areas affected by the nuclear reactor
meltdown in Fukushima to help prevent encouraging players to enter dangerous
areas.  <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima>
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pokemon-go>

Tepco said it has tested the Fukushima Daiichi plant, which was partially
destroyed by the March 2011 disaster, the nearby Fukushima Daini plant and
the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in Niigata Prefecture and found Pokémon
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pokemon> on-site.

Japan's nuclear regulator sent out a warning to national energy providers
telling them to tighten security after the incursion of three teenagers into
a nuclear power plant in Ohio in the US. Tepco has banned employees from
playing Pokémon Go on site.

The Fukushima governor, Masao Uchibori, said that it was not good that
people might enter nuclear plants or evacuation zones designated after the
nuclear disaster on the hunt for Pokémon and that ``the prefectural
government will consider how to draw attention to this.''

The city government of Nagasaki has already requested that Niantic remove
Pokémon from Nagasaki Peace Park, which is maintained as a memorial to
victims of the atomic bombing of the city in 1945. The city has also asked
visitors to refrain from playing the game saying that ``the Peace Park is a
place for prayer.''

Niantic said it would modify the game if the company discovered problems.

Japan, the home of Pokémon, had to wait for weeks after the Pokémon
Go's original launch in Australia, owing to worries about overloaded servers
and the commercial agreement with McDonald's for sponsored Pokémon stops.

reports of minor traffic incidents including that of a Pokémon
Go-playing male high school student and a 30-year-old man colliding on a
street in Tokyo's Adachi Ward while riding bicycles.

The Pokémon Go global craze has led South Koreans to flock to a remote
region holocaust museums having to discourage players, naive New Zealanders
Led to Hell's Angels clubs and police stations filled with players.  It has
also caused car accidents, impromptu flash-mobs in the middle of New York
streets and people to walk into the sea in pursuit of some of the more rare
creatures.

It's common practice for even the manufacturers' authorized repair shops to
use cheaper aftermarket parts from other manufacturers.  Today it's
headlights and brake pads, tomorrow it'll be the sensors used for automated
driving.  If an accident investigation shows that a repair shop substituted
a cheaper sensor, painted over one, or - as in two NASA probes - installed a

In the death in an auto accident where the human in the driver seat was not
driving, he was using the Autopilot of a Tesla model S, while he watched a
Harry Potter movie.

On 26 Jul 2016, the US National Transportation Safety Board
<http://www.ntsb.gov> (NTSB) issued its preliminary report
<http://go.usa.gov/xYjNJ> (executive summary) for the investigation of a
fatal 7 May 2016 highway crash on US Highway 27A, near Williston, Florida.

The preliminary NTSB report details the collision involving a 53-foot
semitrailer in combination with a 2014 Freightliner Cascadia truck tractor
and a 2015 Tesla Model S. The report states that according to system
performance data downloaded from the car, the indicated vehicle speed was 74
mph just prior to impact, and the posted speed limit was 65 mph.

  [Al Mac observation: In the USA, police usually ticket vehicles traveling
  at 10 mph, or more, above the speed limit Thus, traveling at 9 mph above
  the speed limit, was probably the speed of the rest of the traffic around
  where the collision occurred.]

The car's system performance data also revealed the driver was using the
advanced driver assistance features Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and
Autosteer lane-keeping assistance. The car was also equipped with automatic
emergency braking that is designed to automatically apply the brakes to
reduce the severity of or assist in avoiding frontal collisions.

The NTSB preliminary report does not contain any analysis of data and does
not state probable cause for the crash.

The continuing investigation may contribute supplements or corrections to
this preliminary info.

The NTSB executive summary and PDF detail include photos of the
consequences, and where it happened.
http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/HWY16FH018-Preliminary-Report.pdf >

All aspects of the crash remain under NTSB investigation. While no timeline
has been established, final reports are generally published 12 months after
the release of a preliminary report.

NHTSA also has preliminary data on this crash.  Keywords for searching NHTSA
reports, to see if they have any more info, on this crash:

 Business Data

In RISKS-29.64, Carl Byington suggests writing zeroes to "almost all" of a
disk prior to decomissioning.  Rather than a one-pass hand- rolled solution
with highly predictable data, I've used Darik's Boot and Nuke (DBAN), which
makes multiple overwriting passes with "random" data.  No doubt other
solutions exist, too.

Of course, if the disk holds *really* sensitive data, the best solution is
physical destruction: Shatter the platters and scatter the shards,
preferably across multiple incinerators.

Once the computer is broken, you cannot boot it to erase the disk.  The disk
can be partially faulty and shredding becomes non-trivial.  You may want to
send computer to repair without destructing your data.

The proper way is to use full-disk encryption from the very beginning.  To
wipe such disk you simply forget the password.

By the way, there is less cryptic "shred /dev/sda" instead of "dd".

[ Swiss train becomes invisible if 256 axles are counted ]

I passed this along to a rail freak, and he replied that the train in
question would have to have over 60 wagons (4 axles each), plus the loco(s).
The sort of Swiss lines using axle counters would not encounter a freight
train this long, but nonetheless the bug is inexcusable, as the software
could well be exported.

          "Evolving Critical Systems,"
   presented on Tuesday, August 2 at 12 pm ET
by Mike Hinchey, Director of Lero, the Irish Software Research Centre.

Increasingly software can be considered to be critical, due to the business
or other functionality which it supports. Upgrades or changes to such
software are expensive and risky, primarily because the software has not
been designed and built for ease of change. Expertise, tools and
methodologies which support the design and implementation of software
systems that evolve without risk (of failure or loss of quality) are
essential. We address a research agenda for building software in
computer-based systems that (a) is highly reliable and (b) retains this
reliability as it evolves, either over time or at run-time and illustrate
this with a complex example from the domain of space exploration.

Duration: 60 minutes (including audience Q&A)

The talk will be followed by a question-and-answer session moderated by
Stephen Ibaraki, Chair of the ACM Professional Development Committee and
member of the ACM Practitioner Board.
