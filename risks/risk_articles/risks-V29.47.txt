  [This is a fascinating article.  Senator Lieu is concerned that mobile
  phones are vulnerable to surveillance by anyone (not just law enforcement)
  -- because of the SS7 vulnerability.  The article also quotes Karsten
  Nohl, who demonstrated the vulnerabilities for Senator Lieu: "The ability
  to intercept cellphone calls through the SS7 network is an open secret
  among the world's intelligence agencies -- including ours -- and they
  don't necessarily want that hole plugged."  PGN]

Subject: Bank back stabbing

Before opening financial accounts, I do some due diligence about the place,
which isn't easy, thanks to bank secrecy.  Then every few years I do this
again for all places I got accounts, because stuff happens we can find out
about, such as a 5 star rating falling to 2 stars.  Several banks in my city
are UNRATED.  Needless to say, I have accounts with none of them, except one
which WAS rated, then had a merger over a year ago, became unrated, and is
still that way.

I keep notes on what I'm doing, try to reconcile bank statements, then go
visit them to ask when I can=92t explain things.  Also I sometimes visit to
do non-standard operations.  This can lead to interesting life experiences
learning about hidden bank rules.


* When we open a CD (Certificate of Deposit), there is a contract with the
rules.  Apparently banks may change these rules, retroactively, and if the
customer not like it, tough.  Banks are like landlords and their leases, in
this regard.  Customers cannot change contracts retroactively, without
signature of other party.  In recent years, many US judges have ruled that
only the customers are bound by contracts, not the banks.

"We're supposed to report, on our tax returns, ALL funds (and other assets)
received from ALL persons and institutions, with very few exceptions.  The
institutions are also supposed to report this to gov taxing authorities.
MANY DO NOT.  (There also was a recent US Tax Court ruling where someone got
in trouble for not properly reporting extremely large allowance paid adult
children.). Fortunately, if I notice this missing info, I can go ASK them,
but then I have to supply the account #, the CD #, etc, which can include a
CD which matured & was closed out, so where did I put the paperwork on now
gone CD, whose interest I need to report on my taxes?

* Many banks consider themselves exempt from gov regulations, can make up
new rules, then say "We have to do this by gov rules," without providing any
citation, and I cannot find that on any gov site.  When they do that to me,
I close the account, because I find that behavior to be intolerable.

Subject: House GOP Passes Anti-Net Neutrality Bill Despite Obama Veto Threat

http://motherboard.vice.com/read/house-republicans-anti-net-neutrality-bill-obama-fcc

  Brushing aside a veto threat from President Obama, Republicans in Congress
  passed a controversial bill on Friday that public interest groups say
  would kneecap federal net neutrality Internet protections.  Open Internet
  advocates call the "No Rate Regulation of Broadband Internet Access Act,"
  which was approved in a 241-173 vote largely along party lines, just the
  latest GOP attempt to undermine federal rules protecting net neutrality,
  the principle that all content on the Internet should be equally
  accessible.

complex sentences with each iteration."

Well, that's certainly risk free. I mean, who here has ever clicked the
wrong box/button/link on a web page?

And I've always wanted Google to save me the trouble of reading email to

guess.

Subject: Re: Online election hacking (BBW, RISKS-29.46)

Elections don't have to be online to be hacked. The central tabulators that
count the votes in most US election districts are nothing but computers and
it has been proven that they can be directly or remotely hacked. Since the
software used is proprietary, the results are not verifiable or at least not
verifiable within a useful timespan, i.e., before a candidate is sworn into
office, after which federal officials cannot be directly recalled by voters
even if it is proven that the election was stolen.

Our elections, like our currency, are backed only by faith and credit in the
US government. I wonder how many computer professionals retain their faith
in an electoral system that cannot be verified? As long as they weren't
partisan, they could probably incorporate as a religion, The Church of
Divine Election Protection, and become tax exempt.

  (RISKS-29.46)

I am not a lawyer, but I debate legal principles on various forums, which
may lead some people to believe that I know what I am talking about.

The context of my response are two posts on the Burr-Feinstein bill, via
posts # 3 and # 2:
  <http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/29.46.html>

Which was apparently down when I tried to retrieve the links.

I had been reading, in many posts and stories. that laws like this mean that
many US consumers of electronics would seek the products of other nations,
which they think would have privacy protections, outside the loss of them
from US firms.  But then, while I was following Panama Papers coverage, =

m%2Fwatch%3Fv%VzccIZUEYws&urlhash=mzWd&_t=tracking_anet>

Reminded me, that in the absence of any international court of justice with
jurisdiction, the US has been enforcing US laws on people and companies
actions extraterritorially. For example, a Dutch company does something in
Africa, which is a violation of US laws, so the US drags that company into
US courts. The US usually only does this if the company has a foot print in
the USA, which is a reason some companies refuse to have a foot print in the
USA.  There have also been cases of refugees, who get asylum in the US, who
are then able in US courts to sue their homeland for the actions for which
the US gave them asylum.

The US authorizes this under ATS (Alien Tort Statute of 1789). Other nations
are very annoyed about this US behavior. They think it is improper for US
courts to rule on violation of International Law, where the USA is not
directly involved.

The US Supreme Court ruled on some of this in the SOSA case, which is pretty
complicated.  The US DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) had sent spies into
Mexico to try to infiltrate Drug Cartels).  They were not good at that job.
(Maybe they needed advanced CIA training.)  They were caught, tortured by a
cartel.  Via further DEA spying, they thought they identified who was
responsible, but were unable to get them extradited thru Mexican courts.
So, DEA hired a Mexican national to kidnap an alleged torturer and bring to
the USA for trial.  US court found the accused to be innocent, because of
insufficient DEA evidence.  That person then went thru US courts to charge
the DEA sub-contractor with kidnapping, which is illegal in both USA and
Mexico.  US Supreme Court said the kidnapped person had grounds for a civil
law suit. One Lesson is that if the US wants to kidnap someone from another
nation, the plan had better have enough evidence for conviction, or else put
them in a CIA jail which is really secret.

That is a precedent.
