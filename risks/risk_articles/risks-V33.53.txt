 U.S. Army, CDC apps

Thousands of smartphone applications in Apple and Google's online stores
contain computer code developed by a technology company, Pushwoosh, that
presents itself as based in the United States, but is actually Russian,
Reuters has found.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States'
main agency for fighting major health threats, said it had been deceived
into believing Pushwoosh was based in the U.S. capital. After learning about
its Russian roots from Reuters, it removed Pushwoosh software from seven
public-facing apps, citing security concerns.

The U.S. Army said it had removed an app containing Pushwoosh code in March.

Subject: How North Korea became a mastermind of crypto cybercrime
 (Ars Technica)

Cryptocurrency theft has become one of the regimeâs main sources of
regvenue.  Created by a Vietnamese gaming studio, Axie Infinity offers
players the chance to breed, trade, and fight Pokémon-like cartoon monsters
to earn cryptocurrency.  But earlier this year, the network of blockchains
that underpin the game's virtual world was raided by a North Korean hacking
syndicate, which made off with roughly $620 million in the ether
cryptocurrency.

The crypto heist, one of the largest of its kind in history, was confirmed
by the FBI, which vowed to continue to expose and combat [North Korea's] use
of illicit activities -- including cybercrime and cryptocurrency theft -- to
generate revenue for the regime.

The successful crypto heists illustrate North Korea’s growing sophistication
as a malign cyber actor. Western security agencies and cyber security
companies treat it as one of the world's four principal nation-state-based
cyberthreats, alongside China, Russia, and Iran.

According to a UN panel of experts monitoring the implementation of
international sanctions, money raised by North Korea's criminal
cyber-operations are helping to fund the country's illicit ballistic missile
and nuclear programs. Anne Neuberger, US deputy national security adviser
for cybersecurity, said in July that North Korea ``uses cyber to gain, we
estimate, up to a third of their funds for their missile program.''

Crypto analysis firm Chainalysis estimates that North Korea stole
approximately $1 billion in the first nine months of 2022 from decentralized
crypto exchanges alone.  ...

Subject: U.S. NSA recommends 'memory safe' languages (Media Defense)

The U.S. NSA finally came out this week to strongly endorse `memory-safe'
languages for most software programming, specifically mentioning C#, Go,
Java, Ruby, Rust, and Swift as examples.

Apparently orphaned DoD language *Ada* was conspicuously left out of

NSA's list, even though versions of Ada that target JVM can utilize Java
JVM's GC.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)

Ubiquitous web language *Javascript* was also conspicuous by its absence,
even though Javascript has a sophisticated GC.
https://javascript.info/garbage-collection

Also curiously, NSA left out any mention of Arm's *CHERI*
(Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions) architecture
which should address NSA's performance concerns:

  ``Memory safety can be costly in performance ... There is also considerable
  performance overhead associated with checking the bounds on every array
  access that could potentially be outside of the array.''
  https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/

    CHERI, can you come out tonight (Come come, come out tonight)
    You, ooh better ask your NSA (CHERI baby)
    Tell her everything is *all right*.

    (Apologies to Frankie Valli &amp; Bob Gaudio)

With Arm's new 'Morello' processor, can I finally replace my *Raspberry Pi*
with a *CHERI Pi*??

  [Now I know what startup sound will play when CHERI Pi boots...  :-) ]

While waiting, use CHERI as a QEMU virtual machine?

https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/10/2003112742/-1/-1/0/CSI_SOFTWARE_MEMORY_SAFETY.PDF

``Memory issues in software comprise a large portion of the exploitable
vulnerabilities in existence. NSA advises organizations to consider making a
strategic shift from programming languages that provide little or no
inherent memory protection, suchas C/C++, to a memory safe language when
possible.  [Examples noted above, with html trademarks omitted here.  PGN]
Memory-safe languages provide differing degrees of memory usage protections,
so available code hardening defenses, such as compiler options, tool
analysis, and operating system configurations, should be used for their
protections as well. By using memory-safe languages and available code
hardening defenses, many memory vulnerabilities can be prevented, mitigated,
or made very difficult for cyber-actors to exploit.''

Subject: Re: Rust (RISKS-33.52)

Memory is the resource every computer program uses, but it's not the
only resource.

Nobody (that I know of) managed to pull off proper object destruction in a
garbage-collected language. Thus, if a program written in a
*garbage-collected* language uses those *other* resources, there is no
guarantee as to when it might release them. The best they can do is
*sometime between when the object goes out of scope, and when the program
terminates*. And that's just not good enough for many applications including
systems programming.

That's what Rust has that automatic memory management doesn't: *when a
variable goes out of scope, its destructor is run, or it's dropped*.

Subject: Cyber Vulnerability in Networks Used by Spacecraft, Aircraft,
 Energy Generation Systems (U.Michigan)

Zachary Champion, University of Michigan News, 15 Nov 2022
via ACM TechNews, 16 Nov 2022

Researchers at the University of Michigan and the U.S. National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) discovered a cyberattack that exploits
networks used by aircraft, spacecraft, energy generation systems, and
industrial control systems. The PCspooF exploit targets the time-triggered
ethernet (TTE) system, which lowers costs in high-risk settings by allowing
mission-critical and less-critical devices to operate on the same network
hardware. PCspoof mimics switches in TTE networks to send out malicious
synchronization messages masked by electromagnetic interference. The
disruption gradually causes time-sensitive messages to be dropped or
delayed, with potentially disastrous effects. The researchers said the
exploit can be prevented by replacing copper Ethernet cables with
fiber-optic cables, or by deploying optical isolators between switches and
untrusted devices.

  [Richard Marlon Stein noted another version, both seemingly derivative:]

https://techxplore.com/news/2022-11-cyber-vulnerability-networks-spacecraft-aircraft.html

A major vulnerability in a networking technology widely used in critical
infrastructures such as spacecraft, aircraft, energy generation systems and
industrial control systems was exposed by researchers at the University of
Michigan and NASA.

It goes after a network protocol and hardware system called time-triggered
ethernet, or TTE, which greatly reduces costs in high-risk settings by
allowing mission-critical devices (like flight controls and life support
systems) and less important devices (like passenger WiFi or data collection)
to coexist on the same network hardware. This blend of devices on a single
network arose as part of a push by many industries to reduce network costs
and boost efficiency.

Subject: Reducing Redundancy to Accelerate Complicated Computations
 (TJNAF)

Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (15 Nov 2022),
via ACM TechNews, 16 Nov 2022

Scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility and the College of William & Mary have developed a tool
to optimize supercomputing time. Their MemHC framework structures the memory
of a graphics processing unit (GPU) to accelerate the calculation of
many-body correlation functions. The researchers created three memory
management methods that reduce redundant memory operations and expedite
calculation of tensor contractions 10-fold. They coded MemHC to enable
memories to persist on the GPU in a manner more appropriate for
calculations, reducing the GPU's input and output tasks to concentrate on
communication between the GPU and its host central processing unit.

  [This may be an issue of bad journalism.  Hardware accelerators *with*
  built-in redunancy might make more sense than jiggering software to run on
  inappropriate hardware.  Furthermore, getting rid of security of the input
  and output is another way to increase performance, but it is totally
  counter to trustworthiness.  Be very careful about what and where you are
  optimizing.  PGN]

Can the grid be affected by electric vehicle charging equipment?
Absolutely. Would that be a challenging attack to pull off? Yes. It is
within the realm of what bad guys could and would do in the next 10 to 15
years. That's why we need to get ahead of curve in solving these issues.'

The team looked at a few entry points, including vehicle-to-charger

cloud services and charger maintenance ports. They looked at conventional AC

Subject: DeepMind says its new AI coding engine is as good as an average
 human programmer (The Verge)

https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914085/alphacode-ai-coding-program-automatic-deepmind-codeforce

If an AI is as good as an average human programmer, then the average human
programmer is no better than an AI which doesn't actually understand
anything about what it is doing.

For some time now I have suspected that the average human programmer just
fiddles with the code until it seems to work and calls it "done", without
having any real understanding of exactly what the program is supposed to do
or how the implementation actually works.  This is my rather cynical take on
"test-driven development, or TDD.

The above research appears to provide scientific confirmation of my view. If
an AI can perform as well as an average programmer, then given that the AI
has no understanding of the program or its implementation and is just
fiddling with the code until it appears to work (i.e., until it passes the
provided set of acceptance tests), then it seems that the average human
programmer also has no understanding and is also just fiddling with the code
until it appears to work.

According to the Wikipedia page on TDD, step 3 is "Write the simplest code
that passes the new test". A suitable candidate for this is code which scans
the test data file for the provided input parameters and returns the
required output (as given in the test file).  Step 3 says explicitly
``Inelegant or hard code is acceptable, as long as it passes the test.''
So, this hard coding should be acceptable. The suggested implementation also
follows the principles of *keep it simple, stupid* (KISS) and *You aren't
gonna need it.* (YAGNI) It has the further advantage of passing any
additional tests that may be added to the test harness in the future.

  [Unfortunately, it massively violates the Einstein Principle that
  everything should be made as simple as possible, BUT NO SIMPLER.
  I think most RISKS readers by now understand that it is the NO SIMPLER
  that is the killer here for trustworthy systems.  PGN]

Subject: Time Has Run Out for the Leap Second (NYTimes)

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/science/time-leap-second.html

Roughly every four years, an extra day gets tacked onto the end of February,
a time-keeping convention known as the leap year. The practice of adjusting
the calendar with an extra day was established by Julius Caesar more than
2,000 years ago and modified in the 16th century by Pope Gregory XIII,
bequeathing us the Julian and Gregorian calendars.

That extra day is a way of aligning the calendar year of 365 days with how
long it actually takes Earth to make a trip around the sun, which is nearly
one-quarter of a day longer. The added day ensures that the seasons stay
put rather than shifting around the year as the mismatch lengthens.

Humanity struggles to impose order on the small end of the time scale, too.
Lately the second is running into trouble. Traditionally the unit was
defined in astronomical terms, as one-86,400th of the mean solar day (the
time it takes Earth to rotate once on its axis). In 1967 the world’s
metrologists instead began measuring time from the ground up, with atomic
clocks. The official length of the basic unit, the second, was fixed at
9,192,631,770 vibrations of an atom of cesium 133. Eighty-six thousand four
hundred such seconds compose one day.

But Earth's rotation slows ever so slightly from year to year, and the
astronomical second (like the astronomical day) has gradually grown longer
than the atomic one. To compensate, starting in 1972, metrologists began
occasionally inserting an extra second — a leap second -- to the end of an
atomic day. In effect, whenever atomic time is a full second ahead, it stops
for a second to allow Earth to catch up. Ten leap seconds were added to the
atomic time scale in 1972, and 27 more have been added since.

Adding that extra second is no small task. Moreover, Earth's rotation is
slightly erratic, so the leap second is both irregular and unpredictable.
Fifty years ago, those qualities made inserting the leap second difficult.
Today the endeavor is a technical nightmare, because precise timing has
become integral to society’s highly computerized infrastructure.

Subject: Akamai finds 13 million malicious newly observed domains a month
 (SC Media)

Akamai researchers on Wednesday reported that based on a newly observed
domain (NOD) dataset, they have flagged almost 79 million domains as
malicious in the first half of 2022.  The researchers say this equals
approximately 13 million malicious domains per month, representing 20.1% of
all the NODs that successfully resolved.

In a blog post, the Akamai researchers explained that whenever a domain name
is queried for the first time in the last 60 days, the researchers consider
it an NOD. The NOD dataset lets the researchers zoom in on the long-tail
rgistered domain names, typos, and domains that are only very rarely queried
on a global scale.

NOD data lets Akamai classify a new domain very early in the threat
lifecycle. All of its NOD-based detection systems and rules are fully
automated. The researchers say that once a new NOD gets identified, the time
needed for Akamai to classify it as malicious is measured in minutes -- not
hours or days. All of this gets done with no human intervention, which lets
Akamai mitigate the new DNS threats quickly, according to the researchers.

Subject: Is This the End Game for Cryptocurrency? (Paul Krugman)

Paul Krugman, *The New York Times*, National Edition, Opinion, A25.
18 Nov 2022 (PGN-excerpted)

We should ask why crypto[currency] institutions were created in the first
place.`

... These exchanges are -- wait for it -- financial institutions, whose
ability to attract investors depends on -- wait for it again -- those
investors' trust.  In other words, the crypto ecosystem has basically
evolved into exactly what it was supposed to replace: a system of financial
intermediaries whose ability to operate depends on their perceived
trustworthiness.

In which case, what is the point?  Why should an industry that at best has
simply reinvented conventional banking have any fundamental value?  ...

As boosters love to remind us, previous predictions of crypto's imminent
demise have proved wrong.  Indeed, the fact that Bitcoin and its rivals
aren't really usable as money needn't mean that they become worthless -- you
can, after all, say the same thing about gold.

But if the government finally moves in to regulate crypto firms, which
would, among other things, prevent them from promising impossible-to-deliver
returns, it's hard to see what advantage these firms would have over
ordinary banks.  Even if the value of Bitcoin goes to zero (which it still
might), there's a strong case that the crypto industry, which loomed so
large just a few months ago, is headed for oblivion.

I cross-posted this to our Bay Area cryptographers' list.  Here are two
replies:

Dave Jevans:
Hopefully this is the beginning of effective enforcement of existing
regulations and the appropriate extension of transparency regs.  While
unfortunate, the FTX debacle shows the lack of enforcement of existing regs.

Crypto[currency] will be much stronger after this, as banks enter the
custodial market. They have charters, audits, BSA officers, training,
oversight, transparency to the board, and insurance.

Steven Sprague:
They are all learning still.
Tokens are api messages for software with embedded value.
Cost of audit for on chain events can slowly approach zero.
Value of audited stuff is higher than un-audited.

Subject: Tuvalu Turns to Metaverse as Rising Seas Threaten Existence
 (Lucy Craymer)

Lucy Craymer, Reuters, 15 Nov 2022 via ACM TechNews, 18 Nov 2022

The Pacific island nation of Tuvalu said it intends to replicate itself in
the metaverse to preserve its history and culture amid threatened submersion
by rising sea levels. Tuvalu foreign minister Simon Kofe told the COP27
climate summit, "Our land, our ocean, our culture are the most precious
assets of our people and to keep them safe from harm, no matter what happens
in the physical world, we will move them to the cloud." Kofe hopes the
digital version of Tuvalu will allow the country to continue as a state,
even if the ocean covers it completely. He said seven governments have
agreed to continue recognizing Tuvalu even if it is covered in water, adding
that its submersion would be challenging from the standpoint of
international law.

Subject: Smart Home Hubs Leave Users Vulnerable to Hackers (Leigh Beeson)

Leigh Beeson, *UGA Today*, 15 Nov 2022, via ACM TechNews 21 Nov 2022

The ChatterHub system developed by University of Georgia (UGA) researchers
can expose smart home hub users to hackers by revealing the activity of
various hubs nearly 90% of the time. UGA's Kyu Lee said, "We were able to
use machine learning technology to figure out what much of the activity is
without even having to decrypt the information." Lee said the information
smart hubs send to individual devices can be deciphered by "using patterns,
the size of the packet, and the timing of the packet." Hackers can acquire
this information without positioning ChatterHub close to the hub, nor do
they require prior knowledge of the types of smart devices to which it is
connected or the hub's manufacturer to breach the system remotely.

Musk's ultimatum to Twitter employees [16 Nov 2022]:
Let's look at Musk's Twitter ultimatum to employees last night logically. He
gives them a link to click by Thursday if they agree to work long hours and
be hardcore and (unwritten but assumed) not question his genius or motives
or personality or obnoxiousness.  If employees don't accept that, they're
out with three months severance.  Now, this is a binary choice. Choice one
provides no assurance that Musk won't fire you on a whim for any reason
whatsoever however fantastical or paranoid.  On the other hand, choice two
guarantees three months pay. In any normal environment, a myriad of factors
would enter into this decision. But given Musk's temperament and behavior,
the decision is considerably simplified.  And it amounts to this: If you can
manage it financially, take the three months pay and GET THE HELL OUT OF
THERE NOW!

It's being reported that at least 100s of employees decided to take up
Musk on his "leave and get 3 months pay" offer, with scrambling to try
keep crucial employees from leaving.
Offices will reportedly be closed until the 21st. Rumor is there's paranoia

Musk says hate tweets will no longer be taken down:
In tweet, Musk says hate tweets will no longer be taken down, merely
deboosted and demonetized, but findable. That spells the end of
Twitter. Q.E.D. -L  [18 Nov 2022]

Elon and the app stores: If Musk leaves hate speech up on Twitter, even
"unboosted" and unmonetized as he now says he's planning to do, he will most
likely be violating the terms of the Apple App Store and Google (Android)
Play Store, and of course various EU regulations. -L [18 Nov 2022]

Report: Head of Twitter ad sales out of Twitter -- again:
Robin Wheeler, who reportedly resigned as head of Twitter ad sales but was
convinced by Elon to un-resign, apparently is out of the company (again)
just over a week later. You can't make this stuff up. -L [18 Nov 2022]

What do the app stores say about hate speech?
If Elon plans to keep hate speech up on Twitter, no matter how he talks
of not "boosting" it or making it harder to find, he will run up against
not only EU regulations but also the iPhone and Android app stores.
Let's see what Google says:

   "We don't allow apps that promote violence, or incite hatred against
   individuals or groups based on race or ethnic origin, religion,
   disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation,
   gender, gender identity, caste, immigration status, or any other

One of our long-time younger RISKS contributors (since Feb 1996), Drew Dean
passed away on 23 August 2022 at 52, while doing the recreational thing he
loved most on his annual vacation -- wind-surfing.  His funeral was on 17
Nov 2022, and we held an very caring celebration of his life on 19 Nov 2022
at SRI, for friends, colleagues, and Drew's sisters and their spouses.  Drew
was beloved by many of us.  He made many important contributions to computer
science and system trustworthiness -- and to our lives -- and will really
be missed.

Subject: In Memoriam: Frederick P. Brooks Jr. (Steve Bellovin)

Steven Bellovin, CircleID, 19 Nov 2022, via ACM TechNews 21 Nov 2022

Computer scientist Frederick P. Brooks Jr., who passed away on 17 Nov 2022,
earned the ACM A.M. Turing Award in 1999 for his landmark contributions to
computer architecture, operating systems, and software engineering. Columbia
University's Steven Bellovin recalled Brooks' time at IBM, where he led the
design of the S/360 mainframes, which comprised five models with distinct
performance characteristics, sharing a common architecture-defined
instruction set. At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Brooks
focused on computer graphics and protein modeling, and pioneered virtual
reality by using a remote manipulator arm to "grab" and move atoms with
accompanying force feedback.

  [Fred was a natural leader and wise person (e.g., The Mythical Man Month).
  I remember the day his Harvard PhD thesis came back from the printer,
  uncollated, very close to the submission deadline.  He organized every
  able body in the basement of the Computing Lab to contribute to manual
  collation, the first copy of which was indeed submitted only minutes
  before the 5pm deadline.  While still a grad student, Fred was coauthor
  with Bill Wright, Albert Hopkins and me on our work for the late Anthony
  Oettinger's statistical linguistics course.  Fred and Bill had done a
  Markovian analysis of eighth-note digrams up to octograms of 37
  common-meter hymn tunes, and a year later Albert and I synthesized over
  600 new hymn tunes for varying length Markoff chains, cranked out on the
  Harvard Mark IV: An Experiment in Musical Composition, IRE Transactions on
  Electronic Computers, September 1957, EC-6, pp. 175-182:
    http://www/csl.sri.com/neumann/Experiment-in-musical-composition.pdf
  (Oettinger was a pioneer in translating Russian into English.)  When Fred
  was later Chairman of the department at UNC Chapel Hill, he had four chess
  clocks in his office, one for each of administration, teaching,
  students/office hours, and afternoon naps.  PGN]
