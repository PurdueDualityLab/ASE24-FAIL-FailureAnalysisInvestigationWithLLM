Let's Cut That Number.

The Ohio disaster shows that the government must improve rail safety rules.
Since 1970, the overall number of train cars derailed each year *fell* ...
while the number of cars carrying hazardous materials *grew*.

A chart lists the fate of the derailed train's cargo, contents of each
train car, and what happened to it.

  Lots of lessons -- ignored warnings, weak standards and poor enforcement,
  lobbies, lack of electronic brakes, crew of two on a train over 1.7 miles
  long, no detectors for toxic leaks and fires?, misclassifying the train as
  not *high-hazard flammable* and violation of HHFT regulations, lack of

Subject: Put Electrical Transmission Lines Underground? Distributed
 is far cheaper (TDWorld)

In the rush for renewable energy, there has been a loud outcry for more
electrical transmission capacity.  Unfortunately, almost all of these plans
call for large numbers of *above ground* electrical transmission towers and
wires, thus destroying the *visual environment*, if not the actual
environment through additional forest fires (cough, cough, PG&amp;E).

One alternative is to *bury* these transmission lines underground, but this
is not a 'silver bullet', as underground lines cost 4-10X the equivalent
above-ground transmission lines, and may last only 40% as long.

Furthermore, even underground transmission lines are vulnerable to a host of
risks, including lightning, earthquakes, etc., and may take far longer to
fix when a failure does occur.

Bottom line: let's significantly raise the planning costs of electrical
transmission, to make *local* *distributed* 'microgrids' better able to
compete. At the end of the day, rooftop solar panels are going to be a heck
of a lot more attractive than covering every inch of currently un-despoiled
land with transmission towers and power lines.

Physical attacks on the U.S. power grid rose 71% last year compared with
2021 and will likely increase this year, according to a confidential
industry analysis viewed by The Wall Street Journal.

A division of the grid oversight body known as the North American Electric

largely drove the increase. The analysis also determined that physical
security incidents involving power outages have increased 20% since 2020,
attributed to people frustrated by the onset of the pandemic, social

  [Richard's summary focused superficially on the undersea communications,
  pointing out they dominate satellite communications.  However, it gave no
  hint of the breadth and depth of this remarkable report.  Instead, I have
  excerpted from the conclusions section:]

The critical role played by subsea cables in global communications means it
is important that they remain as resilient as possible over their design
lives. This study provides the first global review of how hazards to subsea
cables are anticipated to change in response to future climate change
scenarios. Our overarching conclusion is that ocean conditions are highly
likely to change on a global basis as a result of projected climate change,
but the feedbacks and links between climate change, natural processes and
human activities can be extremely complicated, resulting in pronounced
spatial and temporal variability. Not all regions will be affected in the
same way (nor at the same time) by the same processes, and in many cases,
there is anticipated to be local variability. Therefore, future cable routes
should be carefully selected based on local conditions.

Subject: Cox Cable phone follies

I lift phone handset, hear broken dial tone meaning voicemail. I'm not
supposed to, turned off voicemail years ago, use in-house answering machine.

So of course I don't remember how to check voicemail messages. Wander Cox
website, find list of calls, one noted with voicemail. But no transcript
available and no link to play message from website.

I call my number from my number, get greeting that I haven't set up
voicemail. Well, I did a while ago -- and turned it off. So I go through
process of setting pin, recording my name, picking greeting. Then, finally,
it tells me I have a message. It reads me the number it's from, speaking at
110 BPS. Finally plays message, it's junk, of course, so I delete. Then I
hunt down settings where voicemail is enabled -- shouldn't be -- so I turn
it off. Then I check wife's line's settings -- voicemail is off but Call
Waiting is on -- which she doesn't want and I'd also previously turned
off. So I Turn THAT off.

It's hard to believe Cox changed these settings deliberately so I'm sure
it's some misbegotten software update.

Congress could blunt these harms by simply passing a law that would keep

the technologies safely.

Such a law would need teeth, of course. So let's give it some. We can

Subject: Is Your Smart Home Controlling You?

Anna Kode', *The New York Times*

The proliferation of devices creates more opportunities for people to
lose access or power over aspects of the home.

On the first night in his new home, Clint Basinger was unpacking a few stray
boxes in the living room, when out of nowhere at around midnight, he heard a
voice echoing down the hallway from the other side of the house.  ``Good
night. It's bedtime.'' the voice said.

Then, he heard the sound of locks clicking.  ``I couldn't do anything with
the doors, all the windows were armed, all the motion sensors turned on.''
said Mr. Basinger, who had spent 15 years saving up to buy the
three-bedroom, split-level house in Asheville, NC.  ``I had no clue what to
do, so I just stayed locked inside the house that night.''

Turns out, the home's previous owner had installed a smart security system
that he neglected to tell Mr. Basinger about.  ``It was really
disconcerting, being in a new place and having no control over what was
happening,'' said Mr. Basinger, 36, the host of a YouTube channel for retro
technology and video game reviews.  [...]

On one of the first days in the fall of 2019, Aaron Barden came home to find
that the temperature inside his house was at 78 degrees. ``It was incredibly
hot, and I was just wondering, what' going on?'' said Mr. Brden, 32, an
engineer living in New Hope, Minn. "That's when I realized there was already
programming in the smart thermostat."

Generative AI Is Coming For the Lawyers -- Large law firms are using a tool
made by OpenAI to research and write legal documents. What could go wrong?

But the problems with current generations of generative AI have already
started to show. Most significantly, their tendency to confidently make
things up -- or *hallucinate*. That is problematic enough in search, but in
the law, the difference between success and failure can be serious, and
costly.  [...]

Sereduick says that while the outputs from legal AI will need careful
monitoring, the inputs could be equally challenging to manage.  ``Data
submitted into an AI may become part of the data model and/or training data,
and this would very likely violate the confidentiality obligations to
clients and individuals' data protection and privacy rights,'' he says.

University of California, Berkeley researchers found simple head and hand

virtual reality (VR) data recordings linked to them when playing the game
Beat Saber in Meta's VR ecosystem. The game requires near-constant hand
movement and sometimes head movement. Artificial intelligence analysis could
identify individual players with 94% accuracy, as well as identifying more
than half of the 50,000 participants using just two seconds' worth of
data. The researchers said the data also allowed them to determine each
user's dominant hand, height, and gender with a high degree of accuracy.

Microsoft scientists are controlling robots and aerial drones with

the artificial intelligence model was trained on massive datasets of

used to write the computer code for the robot. The researchers
programmed ChatGPT to fly a drone and have it perform actions, as well

Subject: Re: SMS-Based Multi-Factor Authentication: What Could Go Wrong?

The PCMag article concludes with this: ``The lesson is clear. For any site
that gives you a choice, don't opt for SMS-based authentication. If it's an
important account that doesn't offer any other choice, say, your bank,
contact the organization and tell them to do better.''

So what is a better choice? The article doesn't say. And even if it did, if
your bank doesn't offer that *better* option (whatever it is), should you
just go with an unauthenticated account instead?

Subject: Re: Peabody EDI Office responds to MSU shooting with email written
 using ChatGPT (RISKS-33.62)

The likely result of this episode is that in the future, institutions will
use ChatGPT to write the same kinds of post-tragedy messages but affix their
real names to the message. In other words, they will lie about the
authorship.  It's still easier than struggling to say something new every
time this sad story is repeated.

Subject: Re: Trying Microsoft's new AI chatbot search engine, some answers
 are uh-ohs (RISKS-33.62)

Frankly, the factual inaccuracies from the chatbots are no worse than the
accuracy (or lack thereof) of the summary of quick answers you often get
from a standard Google search. One quickly learns to treat those answers
with the suspicion that they deserve.

Subject: Re: Re: rm -rf (RISKS-33.61)

A similar problem exists in Bourne shell scripts, especially those
distributed by computer vendors to perform Linux installations.  There's a
line:

  cd $some_directory

followed by operations on the presumed newly-changed-to current working
directory, e.g.,:

  rm some_files_or_other

A simple addition to the cd command protects you:

  cd $some_directory || exit 1

(or better: cd "$some_directory" || exit 1 # to solve another frequent but
unrelated problem)

  I always made sure never to code a cd command without it.
