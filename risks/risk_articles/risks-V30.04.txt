Subject: U.S. House Encryption Working Group report

The U.S. House Judiciary Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee
Encryption Working Group has released its Year-End Report.  It makes four
specific observations:

1. Any measure that weakens encryption works against the national interest.

2. Encryption technology is a global technology that is widely and
   increasingly available around the world.

3. The variety of stakeholders, technologies, and other factors create
   different and divergent challenges with respect to encryption and the
   ``going dark'' phenomenon, and therefore there is no one-size-fits-all
   solution to the encryption challenge.

4. Congress should foster cooperation between the law enforcement community
   and technology companies.

https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161220EWGFINALReport.pdf

These observations are pithy and relevant to other nations as well.  The
Keys Under Doormats report (RISKS-28.75) appears to have had considerable
influence on the committee, and is cited on the first text page of their
report.

Subject: Project Wycheproof -- Crypto Check Libraries (Google)

GoogleBlog via NNSquad
https://security.googleblog.com/2016/12/project-wycheproof.html

  We're excited to announce the release of Project Wycheproof, a set of
  security tests that check cryptographic software libraries for known
  weaknesses. We've developed over 80 test cases which have uncovered more
  than 40 security bugs (some tests or bugs are not open sourced today, as
  they are being fixed by vendors). For example, we found that we could
  recover the private key of widely-used DSA and ECDHC implementations.  We
  also provide ready-to-use tools to check Java Cryptography Architecture
  providers such as Bouncy Castle and the default providers in OpenJDK.

Subject: Russian Hackers Stole Millions a Day With Bots and Fake Sites
  (Vindu Goel)

Vindu Goel, *The New York Times*, via NNSquad
http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/12/20/technology/forgers-use-fake-web-users-to-steal-real-ad-revenue.html

  In a twist on the peddling of fake news to real people, researchers say
  that a Russian cyberforgery ring has created more than half a million fake
  Internet users and 250,000 fake websites to trick advertisers into
  collectively paying as much as $5 million a day for video ads that are
  never watched.  The fraud, which began in September and is still going on,
  represents a new level of sophistication among criminals who seek to
  profit by using bots -- computer programs that pretend to be people -- to
  cheat advertisers.

Subject: UK Police must be given power to shut websites (The Standard)

Item in London UK *The Standard* newspaper, 16 Dec 2016
http://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/police-must-be-given-power-to-shut-websites-in-child-abuse-and-revenge-porn-fight-a3422131.html

Police need new powers to shut websites and curb access to social media to
fight the threat of child abuse and revenge porn attacks, a chief constable
said today.  Stephen Kavanagh, the National Police Chiefs Council lead on
digital crime, said officers should also be ready to push the boundaries of
the law and sometimes go beyond what the regulations or courts accept to
protect the public from Internet offending.  Mr Kavanagh said he was deeply
concerned at the scale of the problem and felt the privacy lobby had been
allowed to dominate discussions for too long at the expense of public
safety. He insisted that a tougher law enforcement response, including
updated legislation, was needed.

The Internet is a hugely witty broad set of opinions but that should
not be blurred with the ability to buy drugs or guns, harass, share
imagery without consent or, worse, engage in the industrialising of
child abuse imagery.

On powers to access Internet communications, Mr Kavanagh said critics were
wrong to label the legislation a Snoopers Charter and insisted existing
rules contained some of the best regulation of police intrusive powers in
the world.  He said, however, that officers should be prepared to risk
occasionally stepping beyond the limits of the law and added: Police tend to
be too cautious about how they can use those powers to protect the public.

  Um... what about sites outside the UK?

The National Transportation Safety Board asked tech companies to add the
locations of grade crossings into digital maps and to provide alerts for
drivers.

> Either that or we all sit down and write competing web pages ...

If many people do this, then these hundreds of pages will all end up off the
top page of results since they will "split the vote".

To "game" Google so that your preferred answer to a question becomes the top
hit, you need to select *one* page with that answer and get as many people
as possible to link to that page.

It really gets dicey when this attribution is coupled with what is called
"active defense" or "hack back".  That is when a hacking victim invades the
hacker's computers to investigate, or to deter, or to claw back stolen
information.  Is hack-back a felony if the hacker is the US government?
What about when attribution goes to an enemy or allied foreign state?

I suspect that the reason that the US government seems so reluctant to
sanction foreign state hackers is that the US government is itself among the
worlds biggest hackers.  If we retaliate, we invite others to do the same to
us, and we are said to have the most to lose.

And there are vehicles that automatically turn themselves off now ...

I've recently started driving an "ecotec" van, and when I stop at the lights
and engage neutral (as drivers should!) the engine will stop of its own
accord.  Pushing the clutch down to engage gear triggers an automatic
restart.  imho (as a user of this technology) this is not a problem, as a
properly functioning car (yes, I know ...) would restart without the
driver's active intervention.
