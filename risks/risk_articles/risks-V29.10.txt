  Algorithm

Softpedia via NNSquad

  Homomorphic encryption is a method of encryption that encodes data in such
  a way that it allows developers to work with the encrypted data in the
  same way they would if it was in unencrypted form. Operations ran on
  homomorphic encrypted data yield the same results as when ran on the
  data's cleartext version.  Microsoft's new algorithm, named SEAL (Simple
  Encrypted Arithmetic Library) is modeled after homomorphic encryption
  principles, and allows developers to carry out addition and multiplication
  operations on the encrypted data.  For now, the Redmond company says that
  SEAL can only handle genomic data used in bioinformatics.

Subject: Encrypted Messaging Apps Face New Scrutiny Over Possible
  Role in Paris Attacks (David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth)

David E Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, *The New York Times*, 17 Nov 2015
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/17/world/europe/encrypted-messaging-apps-face-new-scrutiny-over-possible-role-in-paris-attacks.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0

American and French officials say there is still no definitive evidence to
back up their presumption that the terrorists who massacred 129 people in
Paris used new, difficult-to-crack encryption technologies to organize the
plot.

But in interviews, Obama administration officials say the Islamic State has
used a range of encryption technologies over the past year and a half, many
of which defy cracking by the National Security Agency. Other encryption
technologies, the officials hint, are less secure than terrorist and
criminal groups may believe, and clearly they want to keep those adversaries
guessing which ones the N.S.A. has pierced.

Some of the most powerful technologies are free, easily available encryption
apps with names like Signal, Wickr and Telegram, which encode mobile
messages from cellphones. Islamic State militants used Telegram two weeks
ago to claim responsibility for the crash of the Russian jet in the Sinai
Peninsula that killed 224 people, and used it again last week, in Arabic,
English and French, to broadcast responsibility for the Paris carnage. It is
not yet clear whether they also used Telegram’s secret-messaging service to
encrypt their private conversations. [...]

Security experts counter that such arguments ignore the fact that even
end-to-end encrypted technology leaves a trail of metadata behind that can
be used to parse who is talking to whom, when and where.  ``Encryption is
really good at making it difficult to hide the content of communications,
but not good at hiding the presence of communications,'' said Matt Blaze, a
computer security expert at the University of Pennsylvania.

Mr. Blaze also noted that the authorities can still read communications if
they hack into the target's device, or what security experts call the end
point.  ``All the encryption in the world doesn’t help if the end point that
holds the keys are compromised.  So this idea that encryption make
terrorists' communications go completely dark has a pretty big asterisk next
to it.''  [...]

  "As Paris reels from terror attacks that claimed at least 128 lives,
  fierce blame for the attack is being directed toward American
  whistleblower Edward Snowden and the spread of strong encryption catalyzed
  by his actions," Patrick Howell O'Neill reports for The Daily Dot
  ... O'Neill reports, "Fox News hosts Greg Gutfeld and Dana Perino, George
  W. Bush's former press secretary, took to Twitter to directly blame and
  even curse at Snowden."

I've already seen various officials giving interviews claiming that if they
had backdoors into crypto this might have been stopped. Of course, at this
point, there's no indication that encrypted comms were even involved. But
officials have been waiting for this excuse. As you may recall, I've been
predicting that at the first significant terrorist attack, officials would
get back to demanding control over crypto -- and the inclusion of crypto
backdoors -- the loss of security and privacy for all of us be damned.

The Obama Administration encryption critics decided in October to merely
bide their time, waiting for a propitious Paris moment:

'Despite the Administration's apparently final decisions on the encryption
argument, I'm willing to bet anyone a cup of coffee that we have not seen
the end of this discussion between now and January 21, 2017.

From the article below:

"the [new French] law allows government agents to break into the homes of
suspected terrorists for the purpose of planting microphone bugs,
surveillance cameras, and to install keyloggers on their computers"

Well, we see now how much those *bugs, cameras and keyloggers* helped.

France Has A Powerful and Controversial New Surveillance Law
https://recode.net/2015/11/14/france-has-a-powerful-and-controversial-new-surveillance-law/

As it plans its response to a series of six terrorist attacks Friday night
that killed 129 and injured 352, the government of France will likely step
up its efforts to keep tabs on the movements and communications of people
within its borders.

As it happens, the attacks have occurred only a few months after legislators
in that country passed a sweeping new surveillance law that gives the
government broad powers to closely monitor the mobile phone and Internet
communications of French citizens.

Passed by the French Parliament in May in response to the attacks on the
Paris-based magazine Charlie Hebdo, the law allows government to monitor
phone calls and emails of people suspected of connections to terrorism
without the authorization of a judge.

http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/5/8553271/french-parliament-terrorism-surveillance-bill-charlie-hebdo

But it goes further than that.  The law requires Internet service providers
to install black boxes that are designed to vacuum up and analyze metadata
on the Web-browsing and general Internet use habits of millions of people
using the Web, and to make the data available to intelligence agencies.

In exceptional cases, the law allows the government to deploy what are
called ISMI catchers to track all mobile phone communications in a given
area.  These catchers are basically designed to impersonate cell towers, but
they intercept and record communications data from phones within its range,
and can also track the movements of people carrying the phones.

Finally, the law allows government agents to break into the homes of
suspected terrorists for the purpose of planting microphone bugs,
surveillance cameras, and to install keyloggers on their computers, devices
that capture data on every keystroke and mouse click.

Critics of the law complain that there's not much oversight and that the
conditions under which the laws powers can be triggered are vague.  As The
Verge noted in July, the government can authorize the surveillance for
major foreign policy interests" or to counter "organized delinquency."

http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/24/9030851/france-surveillance-law-charlie-hebdo-constitutional-court

Surveillance operations are overseen by a nine-person committee led by Prime
Minister Manuel Valls.  But that committee has only an advisory role, and
cannot overrule decisions by the prime minister.

Subject: Let's flush privacy down the toilet (Russell Brandom)

"[A criminal's] most dangerous weapon is the flush toilet ... a perfect
evidence-disposal system installed in every home in America"

Russell Brandom, The Verge, 16 Nov 2015
The problem with cracking down on PlayStations to stop terrorists
If you're scared of gaming consoles, you're scared of privacy
https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/16/9746216/playstation-terrorism-surveillance-privacy-concerns

There's a joke in the legal world that criminals' most dangerous weapon is
the flush toilet.  Imagine, a perfect evidence-disposal system installed in
every home in America, available whenever you hear the detectives knock on
your door.  Tens thousands of potential arrests have been flushed down
toilets over the years.

So why do we keep toilets around?  Well, they're useful for other things.

Today, instead of the flush toilet, we learned about the PlayStation 4.  In
a now-retracted story, Forbes made the case that PlayStation's private chat
and VoIP features may have been used in plotting the attacks, kicking off a
wave of concerns over gaming networks and their potential use in plotting
terrorist acts.

But while Forbes has since backed off the claim that a PS4 was found in an
attacker's apartment, the air of suspicion hasn't fully lifted.  There
really have been cases of ISIS sympathizers using the PlayStation network to
communicate or recruit, and it's the kind of offbeat channel an intelligence
officer might miss.  PlayStation's network is open to anyone with the right
console, and there's lots of noise to distract anyone who might look there.
As the UK's Investigatory Powers Bill heads to parliament, the political
will to clamp down on those networks is stronger than it's ever been.  So
why shouldn't we?

The first thing to say is that the PlayStation network isn't particularly
secure.  It's not end-to-end encrypted, and Sony is open about the company's
right to surveil users, even if it doesn't have much of an apparatus to do
so.  Unlike encrypted chat apps like Telegram and WhatsApp, the PlayStation
networks weren't designed with security in mind, and most users care far
more about latency and downtime than they do about privacy.  If an
intelligence service is looking for you specifically, it's just not that
good of a place to hide.

What the networks do have is a lot of people, which makes them useful for
meeting inconspicuously.  You won't stand out if you set up a private chat
on PSN, the way you might if you log onto a protected chat room or IRC
channel.  It's the protection of the crowd, the same way you might talk more
freely in a noisy bar where you won't be overheard.  This kind of privacy is
more about cultural expectations than strict security, and it's particularly
important because of that.  It can be used by terrorists, sure, but so can
dimly lit restaurants and crowded parks.  If that's scary, then all private
spaces are scary.  If you believe that logic, you've made a boogeyman out of
privacy itself.

All of which brings us back to the flush toilet.  In the wake of a tragedy,
shock makes us value security over all else, often forgetting smaller
virtues in the rush to protect ourselves.  It's a natural impulse, but it's
worth considering where it might take us, left unchecked.  With enough fear,
anything comes to look threatening: a gaming console, a toilet, a
smartphone.  Will destroying them make us more or less powerful?

Subject: Police body cams found pre-installed with notorious Conficker worm

http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/11/police-body-cams-found-pre-installed-with-notorious-conficker-worm/

  A report that police cameras are shipping with Conficker.B pre-installed
  is testament to the worm's relentlessness. It's also troubling because the
  cameras can be crucial in criminal trials. If an attorney can prove that a
  camera is infected with malware, it's plausible that the vulnerability
  could be grounds for the video it generated to be thrown out of court, or
  at least to create reasonable doubt in the minds of jurors.  Infected
  cameras can also infect and badly bog down the networks of police forces,
  some of which still use outdated computers and ineffective security
  measures.

Subject: ICANN policy problems

ICANN assigns domain names, has oversight over Internet registrars, but
there is no oversight for ICANN.

They are in a transition, including a mission statement of making the
Internet worthy of consumer trust.

But meanwhile no one in ICANN seems to be working towards that goal, and the
spam keeps rolling in, supported by registrars, which ICANN is supposed to
police.  Instead ICANN denies its responsibility to Internet users, puts
obstructions in the way of people who identify causes of Internet abuse and
fraud.

http://www.circleid.com/posts/20151026_consumer_trust_not_at_icann_compliance/

KNUJON, and other efforts, identify registrars responsible for 89% of the
sources of spam and cyber-crime, but it can take 5 years before ICANN does
anything about this.  Perhaps law enforcement could pay some of them a
visit, to confirm or deny KNUJON et al allegations.  [KNUJON also noted

This inspires discussion of what might happen in a future where there are
many such cars on the road.

2-8 Nov 2015 BBW (Bloomberg Business Week) has a time line of the history of
driverless cars, forecasting future optimistic expectations (ignoring
cyberrisks):

* 2017 GM & Google cars without steering wheel nor gas pedal;

* 2020 self driving industrial vehicles hurt driver job market;

* 2025 fully automated vehicles on Earth and Mars;

* 2030 All taxi fleets are now driverless;

* 2035 driverless cars shrink in size, with fuel consumption = gains, and
  smaller parking spaces;

* 2040 price drop in driverless cars, for more buyers, but easier trip
  invites more urban sprawl;

* 2045 restrictions on driver vehicles;

* 2050 vehicle crashes become a thing of the past;

* 2055 auto insurance shifts from owners to vehicle manufacturers;

* 2060 autonomous vehicles become mandatory. (will this include police cars
  & other 1st responders?)

Many risks mentioned in past posts:

* Autonomous military ordinance gets hacked.

* Electronic Smog.

* Google did not know they needed to report accidents with driverless   cars.  They thought paying off owner of other vehicle was good enough.

* Ethics -- who to save, sacrifice, when cannot save everyone.

* Humans drive recklessly, violate speed limits, driverless cars at a
  disadvantage.

* Humans in trouble when follow flawed map apps -- ditto for driverless?

* Uploading software patches, without proper testing, often leads to
  outages.  If that causes driverless to crash, blame whom?

* Who is to be held accountable when driverless public transportation
  crashes -- the programmer, who did not know his code to be used for that
  purpose?

In some states, insurance is for the driver.  In some states, insurance is
for the automobile.  In no states, is there a requirement that a passenger
have a licence to be a passenger.

Ipso facto, at the scene of an accident, there may be no one with an ID and
no one with insurance.

The power of capitalism is remarkable.  The level of sophistication of "spy"
tech in the commercial world, for the purposes of gathering and correlating
this data, rivals, and in a few ways clearly surpasses similar efforts in
the national security spaces.

The "economy of scale" of reaping "all the things" rather than being
selective has enabled both efforts, but in the commercial world it is profit
(well, potential profit in many cases) driven vs. being a cost center in the

Subject: Re: My first purchase with a chipped card (RISKS-29.09)

Um... we've had these in the UK for what seems like half a lifetime (nearly
as long as cameras which capture images electronically instead of on film)
-- they work exactly as described.  As I understand it, the problem was that
criminals could, with some difficulty, replicate magnetic strips on a
kitchen-table basis, but they are unlikely to be able to fabricate ICs.  I'm
told that the trouble with the earliest ones was that both cards and readers
had to handle either magnetic strips or Chip&PIN; the readers read the strip
first, and if the card had a chip then a bit was set in the strip to say
"read the chip", but criminals could replicate the strip with this bit not
set, defeating the security features of the chip.  Main fraud problems now
are the usual shoulder-surfing, strategically-placed 'security' cameras
capturing PINs, tampered readers, etc. along with cardholder-not-present
unauthorised transactions.  Incidentally, Brits traveling overseas are
warned that when using credit/debit cards they may be offered billing in
pounds sterling rather than local currency, which seems like a good idea,
but they may then be charged at a terrible exchange rate, only discovered
when they get back home.  As already mentioned in RISKS, a more-recent
innovation is contactless near-field RFID cards, which don't need to be
inserted in a reader, you just hold it nearby, and if the transaction value
is less than 30 pounds (about $45) you don't even need a PIN(!).  What I
found scary was an ATM which read my card contactlessly -- normally ATMs
require you to take your card out at the end of the transaction, but with
this one I had to be sure to select the "do you want another transaction?
**NO**" to 'close' the session.  (And also as already mentioned, fun & games
if you use a contactless travel card on public transport kept too close to
your contactless credit/debit card, see RISKS-28.93 & 94.)  From time to
time there are breathless articles in UK newspapers pointing out that an
ever-smaller proportion of transactions are being done with physical cash,
and looking forward to the glorious day when it will be abolished
altogether.  Wonderfully convenient, but anybody with access to your data
will be able to see exactly what you spend your money on, AND track your
movements.

=> SUBSCRIPTIONS: PLEASE read RISKS as a newsgroup (comp.risks or equivalent)
 if possible and convenient for you.  The mailman Web interface can
 be used directly to subscribe and unsubscribe:

 Alternatively, to subscribe or unsubscribe via e-mail to mailman
 your FROM: address, send a message to

 You may short-circuit that process by sending directly to either

 are included in the confirmation message.  Each issue of RISKS that you
 receive contains information on how to post, unsubscribe, etc.
