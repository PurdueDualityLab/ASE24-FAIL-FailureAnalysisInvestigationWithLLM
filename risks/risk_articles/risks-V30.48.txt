Subject: Drone collides with passenger jet (Digital Trends)

  [Thanks to Nancy Leveson for this item.  PGN]

https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/drone-collision-passenger-plane-canada/

A small drone struck a passenger jet in Canada last Thursday in the first
incident of its kind in the country.

The Skyjet aircraft was making preparations to land at Jean Lesage airport
in Quebec City when it collided with what is believed to have been a
drone. The plane suffered minor damage but the incident was deemed so
serious that Transport Minister Marc Garneau felt compelled to issue an
official statement about it: ``This is the first time a drone has hit a
commercial aircraft in Canada and I am extremely relieved that the aircraft
only sustained minor damage and was able to land safely,''

The jet, which was carrying eight passengers on the flight from the city of
Rouyn-Noranda, 370 miles north-west of Quebec City, is likely to have been
a King Air 100 or King Air 200 model. Reports suggest it was flying at an
altitude of 1,500 feet (457 meters) when the drone, model unknown, hit the
aircraft. No arrests have yet been made.

The minister noted that while *the vast majority* of drone operators fly
responsibly, anyone tempted to fly their machine near an airport is
``endangering the safety of an aircraft, [which is an] extremely dangerous
and serious offense.''

Growing fears about risky drone flights prompted the Canadian government to
issue a set of interim guidelines in March that imposed strict limitations
on drone operations near people, animals, and buildings, including
airports. Violators could be hit with a $25,000 fine or a prison term. Or
both.
<https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/canada-drone-rules/>

Garneau said at the time that the potential for a catastrophic accident
involving an airplane is ``the kind of nightmare scenario that keeps me up
at night.''  After last week's incident, the minister will be sleeping even
less easily.

Canadian authorities said that so far in 2017, it has received reports of
1,596 drone incidents, with 131 considered to have been of aviation safety
concern.

Earlier this month, a helicopter flying over New York City collided with a
Phantom 4 drone, a popular consumer model made by drone giant DJI. After
landing safely at an airport in New Jersey, parts of the mangled quadcopter
were extracted from the body of the helicopter.

Federal Aviation Administration data compiled between February and September
2016 lists 1,274 possible drone sightings by U.S. air traffic facilities,
compared to 874 for the same period a year earlier.

Rogue drone flights in off-limits locations is a growing headache for the
authorities as the market for consumer machines continues to grow.

The challenge of dealing with rogue drones has spawned a new industry geared
toward developing technology that takes control of the drone from the
operator to remove it from the sky, while the Pentagon recently approved a
policy allowing the U.S. military to shoot down rogue drones flying close to
its military installations across the country.

Medical IoT devices: the security nightmare that keeps CIOs up late at night

A survey by security company ZingBox found that U.S. hospitals on average
have between 10 and 15 connected devices per bed. A large hospital can have
more than 5,000 beds. Every connected device, and the systems managing them,
is a target for hackers and malware -- and the devices often aren't
well-protected.

U.S. DHS and FDA Face Medical Device Security Woes

While most eyes interested in cybersecurity for the past two weeks have been

ANOTHER (DIFFERENT!) Security Disaster Today!
https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/10/crypto-failure-cripples-millions-of-high-security-keys-750k-estonian-ids/

  A crippling flaw in a widely used code library has fatally undermined the
  security of millions of encryption keys used in some of the highest-stakes
  settings, including national identity cards, software- and
  application-signing, and trusted platform modules protecting government
  and corporate computers. The weakness allows attackers to calculate the
  private portion of any vulnerable key using nothing more than the
  corresponding public portion. Hackers can then use the private key to
  impersonate key owners, decrypt sensitive data, sneak malicious code into
  digitally signed software, and bypass protections that prevent accessing
  or tampering with stolen PCs. The five-year-old flaw is also troubling
  because it's located in code that complies with two internationally
  recognized security certification standards that are binding on many
  governments, contractors, and companies around the world. The code library
  was developed by German chipmaker Infineon and has been generating weak
  keys since 2012 at the latest.

  Russian operatives apparently didn't just lean on Facebook and Twitter in
  their attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election. A new report
  from CNN details an effort to also tap into the fan base of Pokemon Go to
  cause unrest.  These efforts were being organized by "Don't Shoot Us," a
  group ostensibly founded to protest police brutality against
  African-Americans. As part of these efforts, the group encouraged its
  followers to make use of a feature that allows users to rename any Pokemon
  that they have captured.  The group instructed Pokemon Go players to
  replace the default Pokemon names for the names of victims of police
  brutality, and then take screenshots of their renamed Pokemons. Game maker
  Niantic Labs told CNN that users can't actually share information in the
  game with each other. "Niantic will consider our response as we learn
  more," it said in a statement.

Subject: Politico's Morning Cybersecurity on voting machines

TAKE A HINT - A leading election security expert on Monday urged New Jersey
to decertify paperless electronic voting machines that they say create an
unacceptable risk of vote hacking. "New Jersey needs to ensure its ability
to detect interference is as strong as its other defenses," said Barbara
Simons, a computer scientist who leads the nonprofit Verified Voting, in a
statement. The Garden State will hold a closely watched gubernatorial
election in November to replace term-limited Gov. Chris Christie. Virginia
recently decertified paperless touchscreen voting machines, and Simons urged
New Jersey to do the same. While "election officials take precautions to
ensure that the risk of tampering is as low as possible," she said,
"defending any computer system is not foolproof." New Jersey law defines the
ballot of record as the paper document generated by each vote, but the state
has not enforced that law because it lacks the money to buy new machines
that produce those paper documents.

American voting machines are full of foreign-made hardware and software,
including from China, and a top group of hackers and national security
officials says that means they could have been infiltrated last year and
into the future.

DEFCON, the world's largest hacker conference, will release its findings on
Tuesday, months after hosting a July demonstration in which hackers quickly
broke into 25 different types of voting machines.

The report, to be unveiled at an event at the Atlantic Council, comes as the
investigation continues by four Hill committees, plus Justice Department
special counsel Robert Mueller, into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections,
on top of the firm intelligence community assessments of interference.

Though the report offers no proof of an attack last year, experts involved
with it say they're sure it is possible -- and probable -- and that the
chances of a bigger attack in the future are high.  From a technological
point of view, this is something that is clearly doable," said Sherri
Ramsay, the former director of the federal Central Security Service Threat
Operations Center, which handles cyber threats for the military and the
National Security Agency. "For us to turn a blind eye to this, I think that
would be very irresponsible on our part."

Often, voting machine companies argue that their supply chain is secure or
that the parts are American-made or that the number of different and
disconnected officials administering elections would make a widespread hack
impossible. The companies also regularly say that since many machines are
not connected to the internet, hackers' ability to get in is limited.

But at the DEFCON event in Las Vegas, hackers took over voting machines,
remotely and exposed personal information in voter files and more.

Yet Another Russian Hack of the NSA -- This Time with Kaspersky's Help

The *Wall Street Journal* has a bombshell of a story. Yet another NSA
contractor took classified documents home with him. Yet another Russian
intelligence operation stole copies of those documents. The twist this time
is that the Russians identified the documents because the contractor had
Kaspersky Labs anti-virus installed on his home computer.

This is either an example of the Russians subverting a perfectly reasonable
security feature in Kaspersky's products, or Kaspersky adding a plausible
feature at the request of Russian intelligence. In the latter case, it's a
nicely deniable Russian information operation. In either case, it's an
impressive Russian information operation.

This is a huge deal, both for the NSA and Kaspersky. The Wall Street Journal
article contains no evidence, only unnamed sources. But I am having trouble
seeing how the already embattled Kaspersky Labs survives this.

What's getting a lot less press is yet another NSA contractor stealing
top-secret cyberattack software. What is it with the NSA's inability to keep
anything secret anymore?

And it seems that Israeli intelligence penetrated the Kaspersky network and
noticed the operation.

The Russian government used a popular antivirus software to secretly scan

top-secret information, modifying the program to turn it into an espionage
tool, according to current and former U.S. officials with knowledge of the

The software, made by the Moscow-based company Kaspersky Lab, routinely
scans files of computers on which it is installed looking for viruses and
other malicious software. But in an adjustment to its normal operations that
the officials say could only have been made with the company's knowledge,
the program searched for terms as broad as "top secret," which may be
written on classified government documents, as well as the classified code
names of U.S. government programs, these people said. [...]

Subject: "The Coming Software Apocalypse" (James Somers)

James Somers, *The Atlantic*, 26 Sep 2017 via ACM TechNews, 29 Sep 2017

The growing complexity and connectivity of software and the fact that its
foundational requirements can lead to serious and potentially disastrous
consequences has prompted a group of coders to combat the abstract approach
to programming.  The Communications Design Group's Bret Victor says thinking
about software systems via code is difficult, which plays directly into
their high incidence of bugs.  His solution is a
what-you-see-is-what-you-get interface to enable programmers to write and
revise code and see the immediate effects of those changes on the
application under development.  Some programming experts are following
Victor's lead, with Microsoft's Chris Granger having built a prototype
coding environment designed to provide instant feedback to developers on
software behavior.  Also gaining favor is a model-based approach that is
still sufficiently unambiguous for computers to comprehend, while of
paramount importance is the creation of a program to convert the models into
actual code that can be proven to function correctly all the time.

Subject: Stolen phones unlocked through a phishing attach

The e-crime unit of the Hellenic Police identified 15 individuals involved
in the unlocking of stolen smartphones.  According to an issued press
statement [1] the perpetrators would send a targeted phishing message to the
owners of stolen smartphones that had enabled the device's tracking
feature. The message, purporting to come from the device's manufacturer,
would direct them to a phishing site made to look like the site of the
phone's manufacturer.  The site prompted the owners wishing to find out
their phone's location to enter their iCloud credentials required to unlock
the phone.  Through these the perpetrators could unlock the phone, access
its user's data, and reset the phone so that they could resell it.
Apparently, local phone shops outsourced the phishing operation to
accomplices with a global presence.

As I see it, the scam's effectiveness is based on two factors and
corresponding risks.  First, it targets phone owners who are distraught,
because their phone has been stolen.  These will most probably have their
defenses lowered.  Second, it involves the phone owners in an operation with
which they are not familiar; most phone owners seldom use their phone's
location tracking feature.

Obviously, it can't stop someone picking up your machine and walking away
with it (unless the USB stick is made of lead), but it can stop prying eyes
from having a quick look at your personal documents while you're stood up
ordering your next iced frappe-latte-mocha-chino.

Sounds great, but how can you make this magic happen? It's all thanks to a
wonderful little app called Predator.

The Predator app lets you lock and unlock your PC by removing or inserting a
USB flash drive. You can use any USB stick, so you don't have to remember to
take the same one with you every time you leave the house. As long as you
have a USB stick on your person, it will work.

The app works by generating a security code and placing it on the USB
stick. Every few seconds, it checks to see whether the code -- and by
extension, the stick -- is still present.

  (Fortune)

Microsoft has apologized to users of its Azure cloud in Europe who could not
access some services for seven hours late last month.

The reason for the snafu? An errant fire alarm. Or, as the Microsoft Azure
status report put it: “During a routine periodic fire suppression system
maintenance, an unexpected release of inert fire suppression agent
occurred.”

At that point, the data center’s air handling units shut down automatically,
as they are supposed to, while the conditions were assessed. Some Microsoft
Azure cloud services were difficult or impossible to access between 1:27
p.m. and 8:15 p.m. local time on September 29, 2017, according to the status
report which tech news site The Register picked up.

Subject: Re: Propaganda flowed heavily into battleground states around election

Yes, I think everyone knows that battleground states get most of the
attention from everyone involved in political campaigns. Everyone makes a
coordinated effort to target pivotal voters in those states. That's where
the cost/benefit ratio is best. They *all* propagate their agendas (the
original definition of "propaganda") where they can sway the most votes.
Why waste money on voters in a state that you know you either are going to
win or cannot win?

How is this news? How is this even a risk? Who is paying these Oxford
"researchers" to produce such obvious results?

Clinton didn't spend a lot on states she knew she had sewn up; Trump
likewise. I live in a state that was going to go to HRC and I didn't see any
ads from either one. I kind of like that. It makes watching TV or listening
to the radio much more pleasant.

By the way, the more recent derogatory usage for an inherently neutral word
is more concerning than the fact that campaigns actually go where they can
influence the most voters. It's always the other guy's agenda being
propagated that becomes "propaganda", never one's own.

And don't get me started on how it is a sudden epiphany to so many people
that the Internet is filled with misinformation. It has been that way since
long before the Eternal September, back when USENET was UUCP.  Suddenly it's
front page news that the front page of so many news sources on the Internet
might not contain 100% fact. Something must be done! Why isn't the
Government saving us?

Contractual obligations are nice for placing blame after it all goes wrong,

It is doubtful whether this measure will have the desired effect.  If indeed

It seems worse than that ... I recently had a letter from my bank telling me
that for several years they have to check new customers residential
status. But now they are required retrospectively to check the status of all
existing account holders.

Don't forget - the UK is one the few (the only?) countries that has no form
of identity card system. What proof do they want of resident status? I have
no idea where my birth certificate is (it's only valid as proof if the date
of issue is within six weeks of the date of birth - copies are easily
obtained but are also easily identified by the date of issue). I no longer
have a valid passport. National Insurance numbers and driving licences are
handed out willy-nilly and are meaningless for national identity purposes.
...

I'm probably not alone - an awful lot of people will have no ID to prove
their rights. This has long been a problem - I remember something like this
maybe 30 years ago, when there was a big storm about the number of women who
would be affected because they were asking for a whole bunch of id that
typically the husband would have eg household bills. How does a woman prove
her address when all the paperwork is in her husband's name?

It would not surprise me in the least if the Government has learned
absolutely nothing in the intervening years ... (I think that if I'm forced
to apply for a new passport, I'll try and get a German one.  :-)

Subject: Re: Forget Your Password, Go to Jail (RISKS-30.47)

This seemed a bit far-fetched, so I looked it up (I always follow links,
they tell a different story than headlines, often contradictory).

Two facts not mentioned in this post are first, that this guy had already
been sentenced to more than 15 years for other offenses (which he'll start
to serve once this issue is resolved), that's why no one is in a hurry to
get him out of prison; and second, more important, that he was not ordered
to reveal his password, (and so never claimed he forgot it), only to produce
a decrypted version of the hard drive.

If I understand the points of law correctly (IANAL), he was not convicted,
only held in contempt, so *habeas corpus *is not applicable (as one judge
said, he "keeps punishing himself" by refusing to comply); and OTOH since he
was ordered to *do *something rather than *say *something, the fifth
amendment protection does not apply either.

The important and ominous fact is, a person may be held indefinitely in jail
without being convicted, for refusing to criminalize himself.

The relevance to RISKS is that technology provides the cracks that such a
monstrosity can slip through.

Perhaps the real risk here is taking the claims of paid lobbyists seriously
without fact checking.

This brings to mind the scandal where the Conference Board of Canada,
supposedly an independent Research Group, presented 3 reports portraying
Canada as a top international hot bed of "file swapping". Those reports got
a lot of traction with news reporters and politicians, until a text
comparison showed them to contain masses of text copied in whole from press
releases of an industry group seeking draconian regulations about monitoring
personal internet activity. At least one of the paid Researchers whose name
appeared on the final version of a report asked the Conference Board to
remove his name from a report that no longer bore any resemblance to the one
he prepared.

I understand that Game of Thrones appeals to many people. Clearly it serves
