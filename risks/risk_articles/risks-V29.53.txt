Subject: AV interfering with mission-critical healthcare system
  (Dan Goodin and FDA report)

Dan Goodin, Ars Technica, 16 May 2016, and FDA report)
<http://arstechnica.com/author/dan-goodin/>
That time a patient's heart procedure was interrupted by a virus scan
Securing computers has never been easy.  It's especially hard in hospitals.
<http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/05/faulty-av-scan-disrupts-patients-heart-procedure-when-monitor-goes-black/>

A heart patient undergoing a medical procedure earlier this year was put at
risk when misconfigured antivirus software caused a crucial lab device to
hang and require a reboot before doctors could continue.

The incident, described in an alert issued by the Food and Drug
Administration highlights the darker side of using computers and computer
networks in mission-critical environments. While a computer crash is little
more than an annoyance for most people at home or in offices, it can have
far more serious consequences in hospitals, power generation facilities, or
other industrial settings.
<https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/detail.cfm?mdrfoi__id=5487204>,

The computer system at issue in the FDA alert is known under the brand name
Merge Hemo and is sold by Hartland, Wisconsin-based Merge Healthcare.
<http://www.merge.com/MergeHealthcare/media/documents/datasheets/cardiology/Merge_Hemo.pdf>
It comprises a patient data module and a monitor PC that are connected by a
serial cable.  It's used to provide doctors with real-time diagnostic
information from a patient undergoing a procedure known as a cardiac
catheterization
<http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cardiac-catheterization/details/what-you-can-expect/rec-20202778>,
in which doctors insert a tube into a blood vessel to see how well the
patient's heart is working.

In March, an unidentified healthcare provider "reported to Merge Healthcare
that, in the middle of a heart catheterization procedure, the Hemo monitor
PC lost communication with the Hemo client and the Hemo monitor went black,"
the FDA alert stated. "Information obtained from the customer indicated that
there was a delay of about 5 minutes while the patient was sedated so that
the application could be rebooted. It was found that anti-malware software
was performing hourly scans. With Merge Hemo not presenting physiological
data during treatment, there is a potential for a delay in care that results
in harm to the patient. However, it was reported that the procedure was
completed successfully once the application was rebooted."....<more>...

Subject: Why a staggering number of Americans have stopped using the

*WashPo* Via NNSquad
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/05/13/new-government-data-shows-a-staggering-number-of-americans-have-stopped-basic-online-activities/

  Nearly one in two Internet users say privacy and security concerns have
  now stopped them from doing basic things online -- such as posting to
  social networks, expressing opinions in forums or even buying things from
  websites, according to a new government survey released Friday.  This
  chilling effect, pulled out of a survey of 41,000 U.S. households who use
  the Internet, show the insecurity of the Web is beginning to have
  consequences that stretch beyond the direct fall-out of an individual
  losing personal data in breach. The research suggests some consumers are
  reaching a tipping point where they feel they can no longer trust using
  the Internet for everyday activities.

  May Deter Economic and Other Online Activities

NTIA via NNSquad
https://www.ntia.doc.gov/blog/2016/lack-trust-internet-privacy-and-security-may-deter-economic-and-other-online-activities

  Every day, billions of people around the world use the Internet to share
  ideas, conduct financial transactions, and keep in touch with family,
  friends, and colleagues. Users send and store personal medical data,
  business communications, and even intimate conversations over this global
  network. But for the Internet to grow and thrive, users must continue to
  trust that their personal information will be secure and their privacy
  protected.  NTIA's analysis of recent data shows that Americans are
  increasingly concerned about online security and privacy at a time when
  data breaches, cybersecurity incidents, and controversies over the privacy
  of online services have become more prominent. These concerns are
  prompting some Americans to limit their online activity, according to data
  collected for NTIA in July 2015 by the U.S. Census Bureau.  This survey
  included several privacy and security questions, which were asked of more
  than 41,000 households that reported having at least one Internet user.

While our security and privacy teams have been doing great work trying
to prevent security and privacy "nuclear wars," we've meanwhile been
standing by while our users sink further and further into the
quicksand bog. Effectively dead either way. Entirely our fault.

Contrary to the claims of America's top spies, the details of your phone
calls and text messages -- including when they took place and whom they
involved -- are no less revealing than the actual contents of those
communications.

In a study published online Monday
<http://www.dailydot.com/politics/surveillance-phone-metadata-identifiable-stanford-study/>
in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Stanford
University researchers demonstrated how they used publicly available sources
-- like Google searches and the paid background-check service Intelius -- to
identify "the overwhelming majority" of their 823 volunteers based only on
their anonymized call and SMS metadata.*

Symantec on Monday released a fix for a flaw in its Anti-Virus Engine (AVE)

<http://www.csoonline.com/article/3071390/security/a-critical-flaw-in-symantec-antivirus-engine-puts-computers-at-risk-of-easy-hacking.html>.
All it takes is for the attacker to send an email with the exploit file as
attachment or to convince the user to visit a malicious link. 'On Linux, Mac
and other UNIX platforms, this results in a remote heap overflow as root in
the Symantec or Norton process,' Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy,
who found the flaw, said in an advisory
<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=820>. 'On
Windows, this results in kernel memory corruption, as the scan engine is
loaded into the kernel, making this a remote ring0 memory corruption
vulnerability -- this is about as bad as it can possibly get.'

Pat Reavy, Deseret News, 10 May 2016

SALT LAKE CITY — A Saratoga Springs man was charged Tuesday with
hacking into the United Airlines website, stealing airline vouchers
and selling them to other people.

Ammon Cunningham, 28, was charged in 3rd District Court with computer
crimes, theft, communications fraud and engaging in a pattern of
unlawful activity, all second-degree felonies.

From about July 2012 to September 2012, Cunningham "unlawfully
accessed (hacked) the United Airlines website and obtained Personal
Identification Numbers (PIN) codes for Electronic Travel Certificates
that had been assigned to United customers but had not yet been
redeemed by those customers," according to charging documents.

After obtaining the travel vouchers, Cunningham would either use them
for himself or sell them on Craigslist and KSL.com, the charges state.

About the blog:

I Quant NY is meant to give a glimpse at the possibilities of a future with
truly open data.  I've picked at the limited number of data sets that have
become public, and have shown that opening up data leads to a world where
government and citizens become partners in making our City better.

Along the way, it's my hope that some of the work here can be a catalyst for
better policy decisions in New York City.  However, this is not a left or
right leaning political blog.  It's a blog about transparency.  I do my very
best to let the data tell its own story and get more people talking about
data.

I'm a Visiting Assistant Professor in the City & Regional Planning program
at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, NY, where I teach a statistics course.
But unlike other stats courses, this one is based on real NYC open
data. That makes the class a lot more fun, both for our future urban
planners and for me.  That class, and the great conversations I'd had with
the students at Pratt, inspired this blog.

Wendy's said today that an investigation into a credit card breach at the
nationwide fast-food chain uncovered malicious software on point-of-sale
systems at fewer than 300 of the company's 5,500 franchised stores. The
company says the investigation into the breach is continuing, but that the
malware has been removed from all affected locations.

"Based on the preliminary findings of the investigation and other
information, the Company believes that malware, installed through the use of
compromised third-party vendor credentials, affected one particular point of
sale system at fewer than 300 of approximately 5,500 franchised North
America Wendy's restaurants, starting in the fall of 2015," Wendy's disclosed
in their first quarter financial statement today.

The findings come as many banks and credit unions feeling card fraud pain
because of the breach have been grumbling about the extent and duration of
the breach. Sources at multiple financial institutions say their data
indicates that some of the breached Wendy's locations were still leaking
customer card data as late as the end of March 2016 and into early
April. The breach was first disclosed on this blog on January 27, 2016.

  The problem with Oracle v. Google is that everyone actually affected by
  the case knows what an API is, but the whole affair is being decided by
  people who don't, from the normals in the jury box to the normals at the
  Supreme Court--which declined to hear the case in 2015, on the advice of
  the normals at the Solicitor General's office, who perhaps did not grasp
  exactly how software works. In a world where Silicon Valley is coming into
  dominance, Oracle v. Google is an unusual instance in which the nerds are
  getting totally owned by the normals. Their judgment on the technologies
  they have birthed is being overridden by old people in black robes; their
  beloved traditions and mythologies around free and open source software
  are being scoffed at by corporate stiffs in suits as inconsistent hippie
  nonsense.

Three points: (1) I think Oracle's case sucks. (2) A disclaimer: My name
came up extremely peripherally in the original Oracle/Google trial, and I'm
assuming it won't come up in this one.

And now, (3) It's mostly our own fault that we have so much trouble being
understood and paid attention to in situations like this. We've raised
technical lingo to the status of cliquish religious liturgies.  Our user
interfaces are all too frequently dismissive of ordinary user needs, much
less the needs of the rapidly expanding segments of the population with
special visual or other requirements. Our documentation in general is still
written way above the heads of large percentages of our users. Overall, our
industry's attitude is cavalier and disdainful at best -- contemptuous at
worst. What are users called behind their backs in the lingo of our
industry?

Back in March, I filed a Freedom of Information request with the FBI asking

We live in a world awash in microphones.  They're in our smartphones,
they're in our computers, and they're in our TVs.  We used to expect that
they were only listening when we asked them to listen.  But increasingly
we've invited our Internet-connected gadgets to be "always listening."
There's no better example of this than the Amazon Echo.

In many ways the Echo is a law enforcement dream.  Imagine if you could go

microphones in their own homes that, with a little hacking, could be heard
from anywhere in the world 24/7.  First, you'd need to explain what hacking
was, but then they'd be like, "Nah bruh, yer pullin' my leg."  Or whatever
the 1970s version of that wasn't, don't ask me I was born in the 80s.

Years ago agencies like the FBI would need to wiretap a phone conversation
or place bugs inside homes, practices that can be cost prohibitive and labor
intensive.  Today, you just need some software to tap into a device's
microphone.  And if that device is "always listening" for a command, all the
better for someone who wants to hear what's going on.

In 2016, creepy perverts are hacking computer cameras and baby monitors all
the time just to get their sick little rocks off.  And we know that the NSA
can still wiretap your phone even when it's not turned on.  So why wouldn't
law enforcement agencies or intelligence agencies hack your Echo (presumably
with a court order) to catch the baddies?

[...(depending on which side you're on) this should actually turn out to

msm1267, Theoretical Breakthrough Made in Random Number Generation
<https://slashdot.org/submission/5874667/theoretical-breakthrough-made-in-random-number-generation>

Two University of Texas academics have made what some experts believe is a
breakthrough in random number generation that could have longstanding
implications for cryptography and computer security.
<https://threatpost.com/academics-make-theoretical-breakthrough-in-random-number-generation/118150/>

David Zuckerman, a computer science professor, and Eshan Chattopadhyay, a
graduate student, published a paper in March that will be presented in June
at the Symposium on Theory of Computing. The paper describes how the
academics devised a method for the generation of high quality random
numbers. The work is theoretical, but Zuckerman said down the road it could
lead to a number of practical advances in cryptography, scientific polling,
and the study of other complex environments such as the climate.

"We show that if you have two low-quality random sources -- lower quality
sources are much easier to come by -- two sources that are independent and
have no correlations between them, you can combine them in a way to produce
a high-quality random number.  People have been trying to do this for quite
some time. Previous methods required the low-quality sources to be not that
low, but more moderately high quality. We improved it dramatically."

Yes, ride-sharing firm Uber is collecting information about your

to make you pay higher fares, despite the fact that it knows you probably
would.

Uber's head of economic research, Keith Chen, told NPR's Shankar Vedantam
during an episode of The Hidden Brain podcast that users of the service are
willing to accept surge pricing increases of as much as 9.9 times if their
smartphone's battery is close to flat.

Oh, but don't worry, Chen promises that the company doesn't use this

Facebook Monitoring Your Reactions To Serve You Ads, Warn Belgian Police
<https://tech.slashdot.org/story/16/05/16/1411221/facebook-monitoring-your-reactions-to-serve-you-ads-warn-belgian-police>

Belgian police have asked citizens to shun Facebook's "Reactions" buttons to
protect their privacy. In February, five new "Reaction" buttons were added
next to the "Like" button to allow people to display responses such as sad,
wow, angry, love and haha. According to reports, police said Facebook is
able to use the tool to tell when people are likely to be in a good mood --
and then decide when is the best time to show them ads
<http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-reactions-belgian-police-warn-citizens-not-to-react-to-posts-on-social-media-a7027786.html>.
"The icons help not only express your feelings, they also help Facebook
assess the effectiveness of the ads on your profile," a post on Belgian's
official police website read.

The Independent reports:

*"By limiting the number of icons to six, Facebook is counting on you to
express your thoughts more easily so that the algorithms that run in the
background are more effective," the post continues. "By mouse clicks you can
let them know what makes you happy. "So that will help Facebook find the
perfect location, on your profile, allowing it to display content that will
arouse your curiosity but also to choose the time you present it. If it
appears that you are in a good mood, it can deduce that you are more
receptive and able to sell spaces explaining advertisers that they will have
more chance to see you react."*

Will Self-Driving Cars Clog Our Highways?

<https://tech.slashdot.org/story/16/05/15/223239/will-self-driving-cars-clog-our-highways>

While self-driving cars may be safer and cheaper, the Associated Press
warns they could also create massive traffic congestion
<http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/robot-cars-drive-traffic-congestion-off-cliff-39124254>.
"The problem, say transportation researchers, is that people will use them
too much." One auto industry expert predicts that self-driving cars will
increase travel by those over 65, as well as those between 16 and 24,
resulting in at least 2 trillion extra miles being driven each year. In
addition, "Airlines also may face new competition as people choose to travel
by car at speeds well over 100 mph between cities a few hundred miles apart
instead of flying," and faster commute times could mean more urban sprawl as
workers may spread into cheaper neighborhoods that are further from the city
center.

Subject: Risks of red-light cameras and violation detection

Have you ever wondered how much revenue these automated red-light violation
camera systems generate?  Here's an interesting case in point, namely, the
San Mateo City Council trying to decide whether to renew their contract with
Redflex.  It also indicates that the entire scheme can be challenged if the
yellow-light cycle is too short.

  For the calendar year 2015:
    Income from fines and penalties: $598,048
    Reported revenue                 $229,508
    Cost of the program:
      Redflex contractual fee:       $239,040
      Cost of refunding 1000 tickets
        because the yellow lights at
        two intersections were set
        too short:                unspecified

    Note: Fines and court costs averaged $490 per case.
          The city gets only $135.05 of the fine.
    Note: Comparing four years before and after --
      63% reduction in red-light related collisions
      26% reduction in related injuries

    So, on balance it seems worth it.  Let's see whether
    the city council renews the contract.

Computer Science Teachers Need Cybersecurity Education, Says CSTA Industry
Group, Evan Koblentz, *TechRepublic* 10 May 2016

ACM's Computer Science Teachers Association (CTSA) is crafting a
cybersecurity certification program for computer science teachers to provide
tomorrow's workforce with vital knowledge and training.  CSTA executive
director Mark Nelson says nearly 90 percent of middle school and high school
educators who teach computer science lack computer science degrees.  This
month, the group announced an eight-hour cybersecurity education certificate
course, with a curriculum co-developed by CompTIA that covers
authentication, best practices, compliance, encryption, governance,
penetration testing, risk management, and security architecture.  Teachers
also must complete online cybersecurity career simulations and lead students
in real-life mentoring before receiving the certificate.  In addition,
Nelson says CTSA will team with instructional video maker LifeJourney on
further cybersecurity education.  Another goal is teaching gender,
geographic, and industry diversity.  Similar educational initiatives are
underway via the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's National Initiative
for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies and the National Institute of
Standards and Technology's National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education.
However, the CSTA program stands out by being developed directly by K-12
teachers themselves.

Subject: Anti-tamperproof bottles aren't

RISKS is usually about the risks of computing, but we frequently have a
stated or unstated assumption about physical tampering (e.g., the images on
police cameras are real, voting machines haven't had totals adjusted).
Here's a reminder that given appropriate financial (and perhaps
nationalistic) incentives, real-world anti-tamper methods aren't much use.

I don't typically read about sports, but happened to read this article in
the NYT, and was fascinated by the anti-tampering methods on the bottles
used to hold urine samples, and the effort the Russians went to so they
could undetectably replace the samples with "clean" urine.

Subject: Re: Whistleblowing is overshadowed when SQL injection gives way to,
  unauthorized access...

Consider a story that goes:

Whistle-blowing is overshadowed when bump key gives way to unauthorized
access.

A woman arrested for breaking into the county election offices and copying
voting records is arrested - felony charge.

The woman (a security researcher) posted a video of using a bump key to
break in to what was, at the time, the official ballot box storage facility
for ballots being counted during the election.

At no time did anyone at the county authorize her to break into the election
office.

THEN imagine the story says:

Unsettling concerns

As ill-advised as it was for the woman to break into the election office
when it had ballots yet uncounted, this raises some serious concerns about
election security. She was able to use a bump key within a few seconds and
cause the tumblers in the lock to align while applying slight pressure to
the rotational aspect of the lock cylinder, resulting in the lock
turning. She also indicated that she could have broken the window and
bypassed the alarm using a clip lead.

The county supervisor indicated that despite the brags of the woman, the
ballots were never at risk as they are kept in a safe within the office and
she did not access the safe.

Ultimately the affair is a bad on all parties - the election building should
have unpickable locks and unbreakable windows - but the woman shouldn't be
breaking in to show that she can, and most certainly shouldn't be filming
here felony actions and posting them to the Internet.

My view of how this story would play would be - "felon videos break-in -
posts to Internet - claims to be a "security researcher".

When will we stop acting like 5-year-olds and grow up?

Subject: Re: The last non-Internet Generation (RISKS-29.50-52)

In the UK there's a major fuss right now -- some have claimed high-speed
Internet access as a basic human right, while the Government has proposed a
legal-minimum 10Mb/s soon.  At risk of stating the obvious: regular
telephone copper wires can handle moderately-high broadband Internet over
short distances (few miles/km) so using this in densely-populated urban
areas is no big deal, and for faster speeds, it's easy to run optic fibre to
neighbourhood roadside cabinets (quite probably without back-up power
supplies, as previously noted in RISKS), with the "last mile" still with
copper, or run fibre right to individual users.

As the previous poster says, providing high-speed data links to handfuls of
customers in remote areas is a whole other headache; as other RISKS readers
will know better than me, there are various ways of doing this, such as
satellites, radio from towers in flat terrain, etc., all mighty expensive on
a per-user basis, and the major fuss is about who pays.  Central or local
government grants from taxpayers, or a phone company levy on customers'
bills, or..?

There's the same problem with providing cellphone coverage in remote areas,
with not enough traffic for competing companies to put up masts (towers),
while joint ventures could violate anti-cartel laws, and a single company
doesn't want to be forced to provide a facility which may benefit other
companies.
