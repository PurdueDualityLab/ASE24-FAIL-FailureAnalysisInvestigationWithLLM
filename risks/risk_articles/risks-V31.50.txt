Subject: If you think you voted in November in PA ... think again!

Today's NYT article covers many of the points in my recent lectures (vote
flipping, obsolete standards, etc.) and alludes to why this isn't
accidental.

See:

For Philly, $425,000 in lobbying money yielded a $29M contract to ES&S.
Less the 10% penalty (the entire purchase should have been rescinded).  The
$29M may not include the long-term maintenance contract, which gives them
even more city funds with access to the devices. And now these machines are
in place for maybe 20 years? Sweet deal.

It's not just PA. This voting system replacement scam is going on all over
the country where DREs are being upgraded to include the now-required
paper. As long as the election officials can hide behind the electronic
totals and risk limiting audits they'll continue to avoid hand-counting the
ballots. There may be new machines, but the M.O. has not changed. Keep your
eye on the swing states (like PA). And spread the word.

Subject: China to remove all foreign computer equipment from government
  (The Guardian)

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/09/china-tells-government-offices-to-remove-all-foreign-computer-equipment

China tells government offices to remove all foreign computer equipment

  Directive is likely to be a blow to US multinational companies like HP,
  Dell and Microsoft

  Chinese president Xi Jinping has ordered that all foreign hardware
  be removed from government offices and agencies.

  China has ordered that all foreign computer equipment and software be
  removed from government offices and public institutions within three
  years, the Financial Times reports.  The government directive is likely to
  be a blow to US multinational companies like HP, Dell and Microsoft and
  mirrors attempts by Washington to limit the use of Chinese technology, as
  the trade war between the countries turns into a tech cold war.

  The Trump administration banned US companies from doing business with
  Chinese Chinese telecommunications company Huawei earlier this year and in
  May, Google, Intel and Qualcomm [104]announced they would freeze
  cooperation with Huawei.

  By excluding China from western know-how, the Trump administration has
  made it clear that the real battle is about which of the two economic
  superpowers has the technological edge for the next two decades.

  This is the first known public directive from Beijing setting specific
  targets limiting China's use of foreign technology, though it is part a
  wider move within China to increase its reliance on domestic technology.

  The FT reported that the directive would result in an estimated 20m- to
  30m pieces of hardware needing to be replaced and that this work would
  begin in 2020. Analysts told the FT that 30% of substitutions would take
  place in 2020, 50% in 2021 and 20% in 2022.

  The order had come from the Chinese Communist party's central office
  earlier this year, the analysts said. Two employees from cyber security
  firms told the paper that government clients had described the policy.

  Replacing all the devices and software in this timeframe will be
  challenging, given that many products developed for US operating systems
  like Windows for Microsoft. Chinese government offices tend to use desktop
  computers from the Chinese-owned company Lenovo, but components of the
  computers, including its processor chips and hard drives are made by
  American companies.

  In May, Hu Xijin, editor of the Global Times newspaper in China, said the
  withdrawal of sharing by US tech companies with Huawei would not be fatal
  for the company because the Chinese firm has been planning for this
  conflict "for years" and would prompt the company to develop its own
  microchip industry to rival America's.

  "Cutting off technical services to Huawei will be a real turning point in
  China's overall research and development and use of domestic chips," he
  said in a social media post. "Chinese people will no longer have any
  illusions about the steady use of US technology."

Subject: Chinese tech groups shaping UN facial recognition standards (FT)

*Companies hope to gain an edge by laying the groundwork for global rules*

EXCERPT:

Chinese technology companies are shaping new facial recognition and
surveillance standards at the UN, according to leaked documents obtained by
the Financial Times, as they try to open up new markets in the developing
world for their cutting-edge technologies.

Companies such as ZTE, Dahua and China Telecom are among those proposing new
international standards -- specifications aimed at creating universally
consistent technology -- in the UN's International Telecommunication Union
(ITU) for facial recognition, video monitoring, city and vehicle
surveillance.

Standards ratified in the ITU, which comprises nearly 200 member states, are
commonly adopted as policy by developing nations in Africa, the Middle East
and Asia, where the Chinese government has agreed to supply infrastructure
and surveillance tech under its *Belt and Road Initiative*, according to
experts.

``African states tend to go along with what is being put forward by China
and the ITU as they don't have the resources to develop standards
themselves,'' said Richard Wingfield, Head of Legal at Global Partners
Digital, a company working on human rights on the Internet.

Europe and North America have their own regional standards setting bodies,
such as the IETF, IEEE and 3GPP, which are dominated by domestic industry
players. The ITU, on the other hand, is a space where companies outside of
North America and Europe tend to shape and drive standard development.

Standard writing gives companies an edge in the market by aligning global
rules with the specifications of their own proprietary technology, say
experts.

Over the past few years, Chinese surveillance infrastructure has swept
across regions from Angola to Zimbabwe. For example, earlier this year South
African company Vumacam installed 15,000 surveillance cameras with facial
recognition capabilities in Johannesburg, supplied by Hikvision.

In August, Uganda confirmed the nationwide installation of Huawei
surveillance cameras with face recognition capabilities. Similarly, the
Singapore government plans to install facial recognition cameras on its
lampposts, a contract that Chinese start-up Yitu has bid for, according to
local reports. ...

Subject: China introduces mandatory face scans for phone users (AFP)

EXCERPT:

China will require telecom operators to collect face scans when registering
new phone users at offline outlets starting Sunday, according to the
country's information technology authority, as Beijing continues to tighten
cyberspace controls.

In September, China's industry and information technology ministry issued a
notice on "safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of citizens
online", which laid out rules for enforcing real-name registration.

The notice said telecom operators should use "artificial intelligence and
other technical means" to verify people's identities when they take a new
phone number.

A China Unicom customer service representative told AFP that the December 1
"portrait matching" requirement means customers registering for a new phone
number may have to record themselves turning their head and blinking.

"In next steps, our ministry will continue to...increase supervision and
inspection...and strictly promote the management of real-name registration
for phone users," said the September notice.

Though the Chinese government has pushed for real-name registration for
phone users since at least 2013 -- meaning ID cards are linked to new phone
numbers -- the move to leverage AI comes as facial recognition technology
gains traction across China where the tech is used for everything from
supermarket checkouts to surveillance. ...

The investigations into the dissemination of fake news have advanced in
Brazil as details of the government's online communication strategy have
been unveiled.

According to a ten-hour session involving a former government leader in the
Congress, Joice Hasselmann, a group of presidential staff routinely spreads
fake news and defames the opposition across social networks as part of their
day job.

With federal elections scheduled for late September in Germany, momentum is
building behind using anti-botnet laws against automated social-media
accounts that churn out disinformation.

Hasselmann's statement describe the inner workings of a cluster operating
right next to the presidential office in Brasília, charged with the
development and execution of the online communication with the supporter
base.

Subject: AI Is Not Similar To Human Intelligence. Thinking So Could Be

EXCERPT:

It's easy to anthropomorphize artificial intelligence. We imagine
befriending Siri, or that our self-driving car has our best interests at
heart. When we paint a picture of an advanced AI, we might imagine machines
that *learn*, similar to the ways a toddler might learn. We imagine them
*thinking* or *coming to conclusions* similar to how we do. Even the term
*neural networks* -- an algorithm modeled after the human brain -- brings up
images of a brain-like machine, making decisions. However, thinking an

  IMPORTANT: This HPD8 firmware is considered a critical fix and is required
  to address the issue detailed below. HPE strongly recommends immediate
  application of this critical fix. Neglecting to update to SSD Firmware
  Version HPD8 will result in drive failure and data loss at 32,768 hours of
  operation and require restoration of data from backup in non-fault
  tolerance, such as RAID 0 and in fault tolerance RAID mode if more drives
  fail than what is supported by the fault tolerance RAID mode logical
  drive. By disregarding this notification and not performing the
  recommended resolution, the customer accepts the risk of incurring future
  related errors.

32768 hours is strongly suggestive of a very naive bug. In a RAID where all
the drives were new originally, this could very quickly destroy the volume.

Subject: This might be a genuine Y2K problem -- are there more?

In the run-up to Y2K, one of the fixes was "windowing", where two digit
years below 20 (for example) were treated as in the 21st century and years
above 20 were in the 20th. There was some speculation that there might be
problems when the end of the window arrived.

This might just be an example:

was used. If it is a Y2K end-of-window problem, there may be similar
problems about to appear.

Subject: Fiber-optic cables pinpoint California tectonic fault zone
  (National Geographic)

*A new method using fiber-optic cables pinpointed the previously hidden
system -- and it may reveal more seismic surprises around the globe*

EXCERPT:

Beneath The Cerulean waters of Monterey Bay, just a few miles southeast of
Santa Cruz, California, a never-before-seen cluster of faults has been
found lurking on the ocean floor.

These newly spotted wrinkles in Earth's crust
<https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aay5881>, described
in a paper published today in *Science*, are still largely a mystery. We
can't say much about their size, shape, or how active they are. Still, the
findings show that even in one of the most seismically studied corners of
the planet, fault maps of the ocean floor contain gaping holes. That's a big
problem, because if we don't know where sea-floor faults are, coastal
communities are going to be in the dark about any earthquake or tsunami
threats they might present.

The new research also offers a solution to our tectonic blindspot: We can
harness the hundreds of thousands of miles of fiber optic cables
<https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/03/10/technology/internet-cables-oceans.html>
that send emails, Tweets, and video messages ping-ponging across Earth every
day. Scientists discovered California's newest known offshore faults by
borrowing a garden hose-size fiber optic cable that spans the sea-floor of
Monterey Bay and turning it into an ad-hoc seismic array. (Also find out how
researchers used ancient Aztec records to find a previously unknown seismic
risk in Mexico .)
<https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/10/ancient-aztec-records-reveal-hidden-earthquake-risk-in-mexico/>

Researchers hope this new method might one day be used to collect treasure
troves of seismic data in major cities that are already undergirded by
networks of fiber optic telecommunications cables but don't have the budget
or physical space to install thousands of seismometers. Cables located
directly offshore of major population centers, meanwhile, might be slightly
retooled to serve as the backbone for new early warning systems.
<https://earther.gizmodo.com/inside-the-plan-to-prepare-the-pacific-northwest-for-a-1832591821>

``The possibilities are pretty large,'' says study coauthor Craig Dawe
<https://www.mbari.org/dawe-craig/> of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research
Institute.  ``Worldwide, there's lots of fiber optic cable deployed.''

A vulnerability in the way Microsoft applications use OAuth for third-party

At least 54 sub-domains with with whitelisted URL endings were not

Attackers can take advantage of this by taking over these domains and then
registering them, meaning that they would be approved by default and could
request users' `access_tokens', which would then allow them to take actions
using users' permissions. If a victim is an Azure admin, for instance, an
attacker could access high-level permissions, like adding unwanted members

The earliest compiled high-level languages were considered "self-programming
computers" and "the end of programming by humans".  In a way, that was
correct -- since programming until then was mostly done in assembly
languages; indeed not many assembly programmers are still around by now.

But what such "end of programming" predictions miss, is that while coding is
a rote activity that may be replaced by automation, programming is not.  The
role of a programmer is to expect the unexpected, and tell machines what to
do in such unforeseen circumstances; even with AI, humans will always be
needed to mediate the real world to mechanical entities.

Subject: Re: Train door safety interlock based on hanger not
 actual door position (RISKS-31.49)

I contacted the RAIB about this poor design having read their safety digest
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safety-digest-102019-hockley

My concerns were that the FMEA should have picked the non-detection of the
failure of the fasteners up as well as a lot of other faults including:

1: The brackets attached to the door.
2: The bolts that attach to the 'orange drive pieces'.
3: The attachment of the orange drive pieces to the drive belt
4: The drive belt
5: The pulleys in the drive system
6: The pulley pivots , mountings etc.
7: Using a single microswitch in a safety critical application

The reply from the RAIB is as follows:

  Thank you for your email.  The diagram shows only components relevant to
  the incident and the omitted components include a second micro switch
  which detects the position of the right hand (non-incident) door.  This is
  an old but widely used design. The methods used in the design were
  unlikely to be as now, so our safety digest concentrated on the need for
  effective fastener retention, a message which applies well beyond the door
  arrangement involved in the incident.

Without a detailed design analysis it is difficult to know which of the
first 7 items on my list above are mitigated by a second microswitch.

  (RISKS-31.49)

My concern here is that there are newspaper articles almost daily (at least
in the UK) saying "AI is going to make huge changes to everybody's jobs real
soon, so what are politicians going to do about it *now*?!?", the RISK being
that governments will try to figure out what's going to happen and plan for
exactly this, while real life goes off in a different direction.  Example
analogy is civil aviation when I was a kid in the 1960s; the Brits and
French saw the future as supersonic travel and developed Concorde at great
cost to taxpayers, while Boeing looked to slow but bigger aircraft and
developed the 747 'jumbo jet'.  Not sure of the precise figures, but there
were only 16 Concordes and they last flew about 15 years ago, while 1,500
747s have been built and about 500 are still in service.

> "In 20 years time people will *still* be predicting that in 20 years time
we would have machines as intelligent as humans!"

That's because in this context, "human intelligence" is a moving target.
Until the 1960's, looking up a name and number in a phone book was
considered a task of human intelligence; until the 1990's, it required human
intelligence to plan a travel route using a map and traffic reports; even
driving a car was considered a task requiring some form of human
intelligence until quite recently.

The point is, at any point in time, what is considered "human intelligence"
would always be defined as "what machines cannot do now".  Any task which AI
achieves, is naturally taken off the list of what AI is supposed to do
if/when finally machines become "as intelligent as human".

So the answer to the question "When will AI reach human intelligence?", for
a visitor of the early 20th century (actually, anyone over 50 years old) is
"they already have"; for a current observer, as Martin Ward notes, it will
always be "twenty years from now".

Subject: Re: DMVs profit by selling PII

I have seen Seattle TV stations saying that Washington state mails an
automated notice to the registered owner every time that vehicle
registration data is provided to a third party. That would make disclosure
more transparent than bulk transfer of data without notice and would give
voters what they need to influence legislators, or not if they feel that it
is no big deal.

In the late 1980s I discovered that the British Columbia Assessment
Authority was peddling the names of every home in BC, along with the names
of the 2 previous owners, with zero legislative or regulatory authority. The
only authority in the Assessment Act for 3rd party disclosure was when a
charge against the property existed, and expired when the lien or mortgage
was paid off.

I complained to the BC Ombudsman, as it was called then. They produced a
report:
https://www.bcombudsperson.ca/documents/access-information-and-privacy

The Social Credit (~USA Republican) was in power and drafted Bill 12 to
increase Public Sector Privacy Protection, but got voted out of power and
withered away to nonexistence after reporters used BC Online to retrieve
details about SoCred BC Premier Vander Zalm still being a corporate board
member and about land dealings of the company. I was the Technical Architect
for the dial up (1988) version of BC Online, but my employer found me other
work when I raised Privacy concerns while putting the Technical Proof of
Concept demo together. BC Online exploded to over 10,000 paying customers by
the end of the first year of operation. Banks, Realtors, car & boat dealers,
lawyers, News Rooms.  It was all public record data, but much easier to
retrieve 24x7 with a computer than by checking paper files in a land office
in person during government office hours. It also dealt with concerns such
as pages being removed during inspection by the public.

The NDP (~ UK Labour) watered down Bill 12 to draft Bill 50, which was
proclaimed as BC's Freedom of Information and Privacy Act. It has a black
letter law prohibition on extracting PII for soliciting, yet the BC
Assessment Authority kept peddling PII on optical disks, which Realtors used
for sending junk mail. The arrival of personally addressed real estate
solicitations at our non published home address continued until it went to a
full scale inquiry. I was invited to make a submission to the Inquiry. My
name appears in the Thanks next to David Loukidelis, who later became BC's
second Information and Privacy Commissioner.
https://www.oipc.bc.ca/investigation-reports/1258

Shortly the BC Assessment Authority Director who had been stone walling my
concerns for a decade disappeared from the BC Public Service. Perhaps his
last meeting with his boss went something like this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_L5Z7yLTU

He applied to the BC Cabinet for an Applies Despite exemption to the FOIPP
Act, but was turned down and kept on peddling PII. Did he not understand the
N or the O? That was a pity. It is better when you can be persuasive and
change thinking. Settling for only changing who is doing a job, or simply
their behaviour, is a last resort.

A Victoria BC municipal web interface showing the owner name and assessed
value of every Victoria property, no questions asked, was quickly shut down
by an OIPC BC Order.

That was not the end of the arrival of personally addressed solicitations
using prohibited extracts from BC government records at our non published
address, but that is another story.
