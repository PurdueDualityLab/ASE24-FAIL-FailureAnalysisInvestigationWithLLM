Subject: Downfall Attacks on Intel CPUs Steal Encryption Keys, Data
 (Ionut Ilascu)

Ionut Ilascu, *Bleeping Computer*, 8 Aug 2023

Google's Daniel Moghimi exploited the so-called "Downfall" bug in Intel
central processing units to steal passwords, encryption keys, and private
data from computers shared by multiple users. The transient execution
side-channel vulnerability affects multiple Intel microprocessor lines,
allowing hackers to exfiltrate Software Guard eXtensions-encrypted
information. Moghimi said Downfall attacks leverage the <i>gather</i>
instruction that "leaks the content of the internal vector register file
during speculative execution." He developed the Gather Data Sampling exploit
to extract AES 128-bit and 256-bit cryptographic keys on a separate virtual
machine from the controlled one, combining them to decrypt the information
in less than 10 seconds. Moghimi disclosed the flaw to Intel and worked with
the company on a microcode update to address it.

Subject: VR Headsets Are Vulnerable to Hackers
 (UC Riverside)

David Danelski, UC Riverside News, 8 Aug 2023

Computer scientists at the University of California, Riverside found hackers
can translate the movements of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality
(AR) headset users into words using spyware and artificial intelligence. In
one example, spyware used a headset user's motions to record their Facebook
password as they air-typed it on a virtual keyboard. Spies also could
potentially access a user's actions during virtual meetings involving
confidential information by interpreting body movements. One exploit showed
hackers retrieving a target's hand gestures, voice commands, and keystrokes
on a virtual keyboard with over 90% accuracy. Researchers also developed a
system called TyPose that uses machine learning to extract AR/VR users' head
motions to deduce words or characters they are typing.

** SECURITY AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR (SHB) 2023

[2023.06.16]
[https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/06/security-and-human-behavior-shb-2023.html]
I'm just back from the sixteenth Workshop on Security and Human
Behavior [https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/SHB2023/index.htm]
hosted by Alessandro Acquisti at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh.

SHB is a small annual invitational workshop of people studying various
aspects of the human side of security, organized each year by
Alessandro Acquisti, Ross Anderson, and myself. The fifty or so
attendees include psychologists, economists, computer security
researchers, criminologists, sociologists, political scientists,
designers, lawyers, philosophers, anthropologists, geographers,
neuroscientists, business-school professors, and a smattering of
others. It's not just an interdisciplinary event; most of the people
here are individually interdisciplinary.

Our goal is always to maximize discussion and interaction. We do that
by putting everyone on panels, and limiting talks to six to eight
minutes, with the rest of the time for open discussion. Short talks
limit presenters' ability to get into the boring details of their
work, and the interdisciplinary audience discourages jargon.

For the past decade and a half, this workshop has been the most
intellectually stimulating two days of my professional year. It
influences my thinking in different and sometimes surprising ways 00
and has resulted in some unexpected collaborations.

And that's what's valuable. One of the most important outcomes of the
event is new collaborations.  Over the years, we have seen new
interdisciplinary research between people who met at the workshop, and
ideas and methodologies move from one field into another based on
connections made at the workshop. This is why some of us have been
coming back every year for over a decade.

This year's schedule is here
[https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/SHB2023/program.htm]. This page
[https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/SHB2023/participants.htm] lists
the participants and includes links to some of their work. As he does
every year, Ross Anderson is live blogging
[https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2023/06/14/security-and-human-behaviour-2023/]
the talks. We are back 100% in-person after two years of fully remote
and one year of hybrid.

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/15/revealed-metropolitan-police-shared-sensitive-data-about-victims-with-facebook

Facebook's Pixel tool was embedded in Metropolitan Police web page

The data was collected by a tracking tool embedded in the website of the
Metropolitan police and included records of browsing activity about people
using a *secure* online form for victims and witnesses to report offences.

In one case, Facebook received a parcel of data when someone clicked a link
to œôòüsecurely and confidentially report rape or sexual assaultœôòý to the Met
online. This included the sexual nature of the offence being reported, the
time the page was viewed and a code denoting the personœôòùs Facebook account
ID.

The tracking tool, known as Meta Pixel, also sent details to Facebook about
content viewed and buttons clicked on webpages linked to contacting police,
accessing victim services, and advice pages for crimes including rape,
assaults, stalking and fraud."

What was the person who installed the tool thinking?

We must assume that almost(?) every web site reports our activity to
Facebook and Google.

I guess it's time for Tor.

If you feed America's most important legal document -- the US Constitution

it will tell you that the document was almost certainly written by AI. But
unless James Madison was a time traveler, that can't be the case. Why do AI
writing detection tools give false positives? We spoke to several experts --
and the creator of AI writing detector GPTZero -- to find out.

Among news stories of overzealous professors

student mastery of a topic.

As tempting as it is to rely on AI tools to detect AI-generated writing,
evidence so far has shown that they are not reliable
<https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/16/most-sites-claiming-to-catch-ai-written-text-fail-spectacularly/>.
Due to false positives, AI writing detectors such as GPTZero
<https://gptzero.me/>, ZeroGPT <https://www.zerogpt.com/>, and OpenAI's Text
Classifier <https://platform.openai.com/ai-text-classifier> cannot
<https://theconversation.com/we-pitted-chatgpt-against-tools-for-detecting-ai-written-text-and-the-results-are-troubling-199774>
be trusted to detect text composed by large language models (LLMs) like
ChatGPT.

If you feed GPTZero a section of the US Constitution, it says the text is
``likely to be written entirely by AI.'' Several times over the past six
months, screenshots of other AI detectors showing similar results have gone
viral <https://twitter.com/0xgaut/status/1648383977139363841?s=20> on
social media, inspiring confusion and plenty of jokes about the founding
fathers being robots. It turns out the same thing happens with selections
from The Bible, which also show up as being AI-generated.

To explain why these tools make such obvious mistakes (and otherwise often
return false positives), we first need to understand how they work.

Subject: ChatGPT's Accuracy Has Gotten Worse (Andrew Paul)

Andrew Paul, *Popular Science*, 19 Jul 2023, via ACM TechNews,

Stanford University and University of Southern California, Berkeley
(UC Berkeley) researchers demonstrated an apparent decline in the
reliability of OpenAI's ChatGPT large language model (LLM) over time
without any solid explanation. The researchers assessed the chatbot's
tendency to offer answers with varying degrees of accuracy and
quality, as well as how appropriately it follows instructions. In one
example, the researchers observed that GPT-4's nearly 98% accuracy in
identifying prime numbers fell to less than 3% between March and June
2023, while GPT-3.5's accuracy increased; both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's
code-generation abilities worsened in that same interval. UC
Berkeley's Matei Zaharia suggested the decline may reflect a limit
reached by reinforcement learning from human feedback, or perhaps bugs
in the system.

Scientists at the University of Southern California (USC), Intel Labs, and
the Chinese Academy of Sciences demonstrated that robots can be trained to
train other robots by sharing their knowledge. The researchers developed the
Shared Knowledge Lifelong Learning (SKILL) tool to teach artificial
intelligence agents 102 unique tasks whose knowledge they then shared over a
decentralized communication network. The researchers said they found the
SKILLtool's algorithms speed up the learning process by allowing agents to
learn concurrently in parallel. The work indicated learning time shrinks by
a factor of 101.5 when 102 agents each learn one task and then share.

 Algorithm (Kim Zetter)

Kim Zetter, *Ars Technica*, 25 Jul 2023

Researchers with Netherlands-based security consultancy Midnight Blue
have uncovered a secret backdoor in technology long used for critical
data and voice radio communications worldwide. The backdoor resides in
an algorithm embedded within commercially sold devices that transmit
encrypted data and commands, allowing users to eavesdrop on
communications and potentially hijack critical infrastructure. The
researchers found the backdoor and four other flaws in the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute's Terrestrial Trunked Radio
(TETRA) standard in 2021, but waited until radio manufacturers could
develop patches and mitigations before disclosing them. The
researchers also learned most police forces worldwide (excluding the
U.S.) use TETRA-based radio technology.

Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University and the Center for AI Safety
demonstrated the ability to produce nearly infinite volumes of
destructive information by bypassing artificial intelligence (AI)
protections in any leading chatbot. The researchers found they could
exploit open source systems by appending a long suffix of characters
onto each English-language prompt inputted into the system. In this
manner, they were able to persuade chatbots to provide harmful
information and generate discriminatory, counterfeit, and otherwise
toxic data. The researchers found they could use this method to
circumvent the safeguards of OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Bard, and
Anthropic's Claude chatbots. While they concede that an obvious
countermeasure for preventing all such attacks does not exist, the
researchers suggest chatbot developers could block the suffixes they
identified.

Security researchers at Germany's Technical University of Berlin have
cracked modern Tesla vehicles' Media Control Unit (MCU) to access paid

private user data such as the phonebook, calendar entries, etc." The

Detroit police recently arrested eight-months-pregnant African American
Porcha Woodruff for robbery and carjacking due to an erroneous offender
match by facial recognition technology. Woodruff is the sixth person to
report being wrongly accused of a crime through such a mismatch and the
third such wrongful arrest involving the Detroit Police Department. City
documents indicated the department uses a facial recognition vendor called
DataWorks Plus to run unknown faces against a database of mug shots,
returning matches ranked according to the probability of being the same
person. Crime analysts decide if any matches are potential suspects, and the
police report said a match for Woodruff's 2015 mug shot -- which she said
was from an arrest for driving with an expired license -- prompted the
analyst to give her name to the investigator.

 (IEEE Spectrum)

via ACM TechNews,

Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers have produced the
first probabilistic bit (p-bit) using photonics. The method's core component
is an optical parametric oscillator (OPO), which is basically two mirrors
reflecting light back and forth between them. The researchers can influence
the likelihood with which an oscillation's phase assumes a particular state
by injecting the OPO with extremely weak laser pulses. MIT's Charles
Roques-Carmes explained, "We can keep the random aspect that just comes from
using quantum physics, but in a way that we can control the probability
distribution that is generated by those quantum variables." The researchers
said they were able to generate 10,000 p-bits per second, which appear to
support the necessary behavior for building a probabilistic computer.

800-374-4472.  The phone was answered as if it were Frigidaire tech support,
but actually was a scam where they wanted to "give" me a $100 debit card if
only I would cover the USPS handling charge of $2.95; yes, that noise you
hear is the sound of your alarm bells.  At this point, I hung up.

Subsequently, I looked up the actual Frigidaire tech support number online
and found it to be 800-374-4432, not -4472, so perhaps the number printed
inside the oven is a typo; nonetheless, it leads to an actual scam with an
unusual set-up.

I was puzzled that someone thought it worthwhile to capitalize on this tiny
mistake, as who even *reads* the printed tag inside an oven, no less *calls*
the printed phone number?  On the other hand, once the typo is noticed by a
scammer, the cost to set up and manage the scam is negligible, which seems
to be the case.

I sent all this along with a photo of the printed tag to Frigidaire tech
support in May, but have not heard back.

This is such a rare and unusual basis for a scam that I'm unsure of what is
the takeaway lesson, if any.

Subject: 'Redacted Redactions' Strike Again

I'd like to coin the neologism "outcroppings" for these redacted redactions.

"An outcropping is rock formation, a place on the earth where
the bedrock underneath shows through."

Perhaps 'natural emergence' has come a cropper ?

 Auckland commuters (Hinson. RISKS-33.76)

WRT the *Defective train safety controls*, it would seem that the controls
in question are the locomotive engineers.  Reviewing the rolling stock and
locomotives used on the KiwiRail service shows them to be common diesel
locomotives, without any form of positive train control or automatic braking
that would stop the train when it runs a red signal.  The issue is operator
error, rather than a fault in an automated system.  It's a risk, but it's an
old one, and not, it would seem, due to an automated system.

Be very careful what you wish for.

While I have also criticized OceanGate in this forum, I'm not about ready to
throw out the innovation baby with the (ocean?)  bathwater.

*Innovation* is *novelty* + *usefulness* + *cost-effectiveness* +
*right-timing*.

Exhibit #1 is Apple, as they have continually reshaped the
computer world from personal computers to desktop publishing
to smartphones to digital cameras.  At each step, the 'market
research' said that no one was interested in these devices; the
reason, of course, is that no one had had access to such devices,
so the intuition of the market research subjects was wrong.

There's a curious relationship between 'fake news' and
innovation: *the experts are always wrong*, because *experts*
(by definition) are *backwards-looking*. You can't be an expert
in a field that doesn't exist yet. Yet the 'expert' is the first to
call every new idea 'fake news'.

An American football analogy: so-called 'broken field running',
when all the planning and practice for a particular play goes
out the window, and the field is completely chaotic.  The best
broken field runners don't think -- they utilize their *gut feel* to
know which way to run.

Entrepreneurs see the world differently from the rest of us.
Where the politicians, regulators and 'experts' decry the sad
state of the world, the entrepreneur sees *opportunity* and
*grabs it*.

For every single new idea there are a million naysayers and
censors.

It takes an extremely strong ego to withstand this withering
criticism. The vast majority of the population doesn't have the
constitution to go up against colleagues, friends, and family.

Exhibit #2 is Christopher Columbus.  More important than how
may people died is how many people survived and subsequently
took advantage of his innovation.  Look back at the famous
explorers -- Magellan, etc. -- quite a number of them and their
crew lived to tell the tale, and the rest is history.

I'm with Galileo: 'And yet it moves' !

We should challenge the myth that regulation stifles innovation.

Some of the most innovative industries are highly regulated.

Pharmaceuticals and children's toys, for example (in the EU and UK).

One could write entire books about the purposes, costs, and benefits
of regulation. (Someone probably has.)

The normal motivation is to protect the public from some direct harm, e.g.,
drugs that don't work or are harmful. But there is plenty of regulation
intended more to maintain the providers' business model.  That isn't
necessarily a bad idea.  When you have an 80,000 lb truck barreling down the
road, I would prefer that the operator have sufficient revenue to maintain
the truck, and to pay the driver enough that she doesn't feel forced to pop
pills and drive 16 hrs a day.

There is a reason that Uber et al. started in San Francisco -- its taxi
regulation was uniquely bad due to a local law that limited taxis to
owner-drivers, with a cap way too small to handle the demand. That was swell
for the drivers, awful for everyone else. So there was a lot of sympathy for
a service, even an illegal one, that fixed the fact that there just weren't
taxis when you needed them.

Some of the innovation was plausibly a good idea, e.g., using an app to
match up drivers and passengers. Some was bad, e.g., Lyft's "sharing"
insurance fraud model taking paying passengers in personal cars with no
insurance in case of an accident. (Uber quickly copied it.) Some was
accidental, Uber's super cheap below-cost service subsidized by lots of
venture capital silly money.

The app also happened to be a regulatory innovation since it completely
blurred the distinction between taxis you could hail on the street and car
services you book ahead. In New York, those are different services with
different licenses. NYC had enough sense to force Uber to become a car
service, which meant among other things that Uber drivers in NYC are covered
by workers comp if they're injured on the job, other places not so much.

Picking apart the beneficial parts of innovation from the harmful or
parasitic parts can be hard, but it is necessary.  As we saw with Ocean
Gate, what is always wrong is to insist that innovation for its own sake is
by definition good.

Subject: Internet censorship

You might be interested in this Ph.D. dissertation by my most recent
student, Major Alexander Master.

Title: Modeling and Characterization of Internet Censorship Technologies

Abstract:

The proliferation of Internet access has enabled the rapid and widespread
exchange of information globally. The world wide web has become the primary
communications platform for many people and has surpassed other traditional
media outlets in terms of reach and influence. However, many nation-states
impose various levels of censorship on their citizens' Internet
communications. There is little consensus about what constitutes
*objectionable* online content deserving of censorship. Some people consider
the censor activities occurring in many nations to be violations of
international human rights (e.g., the rights to freedom of expression and
assembly). This multi-study dissertation explores Internet censorship
methods and systems. By using combinations of quantitative, qualitative, and
systematic literature review methods, this thesis provides an
interdisciplinary view of the domain of Internet censorship. The author
presents a reference model for Internet censorship technologies: an
abstraction to facilitate a conceptual understanding of the ways in which
Internet censorship occurs from a system design perspective. The author then
characterizes the technical threats to Internet communications, producing a
comprehensive taxonomy of Internet censorship methods as a result. Finally,
this work provides a novel research framework for revealing how nation-state
censors operate based on a globally representative sample. Of the 70 nations
analyzed, 62 used at least one Internet censorship method against their
citizens. The results reveal worldwide trends in Internet censorship based
on historical evidence and Internet measurement data.
