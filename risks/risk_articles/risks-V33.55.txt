Subject: Blockchains, What Are They Good For? (Paul Krugman)

Paul Krugman, *The New York Times*, 2 Dec 2022 National Edition Opinion,
and online 1 Dec 2022
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/01/opinion/blockchains-what-are-they-good-for.html

  [IMPORTANT NOTE: I have almost always eschewed including entire pay-walled
  articles in RISKS, resorting to *fair- use* principles.  I have been
  subscribed to the hardcopy delivery of *The NYTimes* for more years than I
  can count, going back to 1940 when I first started reading it daily.  I
  respect the need to keep careful newsources in business, despite some of
  you who occasionally complain about my including paywalled URLs in RISKS.
  Also, remember that the *Times* mantra is very distant from ``All the news
  that fits we print'' nor ``Truth is our least important concern.''
  HOWEVER, I think Paul (and *The NYTimes*) would not mind getting more
  recognition for this piece, which beautifully articulates many of the
  views previously in RISKS on blockchains and cybercurrencies that really
  need wider attention.  (It might be worth for home-delivery nonsubscribers
  to spend $1 a month for Internet access, or whatever the going rate is.)
  END OF RANT.  PGN]

A year ago Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were selling at record prices,
with a combined market value of around $3 trillion; glossy ads featuring
celebrities -- most infamously Matt Damon's ``Fortune Favors the Brave''
-- filled the airwaves. Politicians, including, alas, the mayor of New York,
raced to align themselves with what seemed to be the coming thing. Skeptics
like yours truly were told that we just didn't get it.

Since then the prices of crypto assets have plunged, while a growing number
of crypto institutions have collapsed amid allegations of scandal. The
implosion of FTX, which appears to have used depositors' money in an attempt
to prop up a related trading firm, has made the most headlines, but it's
only one entry on a growing list.

We are, many people say, going through a ``crypto winter.'' But that may
understate the case. This is looking more and more like Fimbulwinter, the
endless winter that, in Norse mythology, precedes the end of the world -- in
this case the crypto world, not just cryptocurrencies but the whole idea of
organizing economic life around the famous ``blockchain.''

And the real question, it seems to me, is why so many people -- not just
na=C3=AFve small investors, but also major financial and business players --
bought into the belief that this bad idea was the wave of the future.

A blockchain is a digital ledger associated with an asset, recording the
history of transactions in that asset -- who bought it from whom and so
on. The asset could be a digital token like a Bitcoin, but it could also be
a stock or even a physical thing like a shipping container. Ledgers, of
course, are nothing new. What's distinctive about blockchains is that the
ledgers are supposed to be decentralized: They aren't sitting on the
computers of a single bank or other company; they're in the public domain,
sustained by protocols that induce many people to maintain records on many
servers.

These protocols are, everyone tells me, extremely clever. I'll take their
word for it. The question I've never heard or seen satisfactorily answered,
however, is, ``What's the point?'' Why go to the trouble and expense of
maintaining a ledger in many places, and basically carrying that ledger
around every time a transaction takes place?

The original rationale for Bitcoin was that it would do away with the need
for trust -- you wouldn't have to worry about banks making off with your
money, or governments inflating away its value. In reality, however, banks
rarely steal their customers' assets, while crypto institutions more easily
succumb to the temptation, and extreme inflation that destroys money's value
generally happens only amid political chaos.

Still, there was an alternative, more modest justification for using
blockchain technology, if not necessarily for cryptocurrencies: It was
supposed to offer a lower-cost, more secure way to keep track of
transactions and stuff in general.

But that dream appears to be dying, too.

Amid all the sound and fury over FTX, I'm not sure how many people have
noticed that the few institutions that seriously tried to make use of
blockchains seem to be giving up.

Five years ago, it was supposed to be a big deal -- a sign of mainstream
acceptance -- when Australia's stock exchange announced that it was planning
to use a blockchain platform to clear and settle trades. Two weeks ago, it
quietly canceled the plan, writing off $168 million in losses.

Maersk, the shipping giant, has also announced that it is winding down its
efforts to use a blockchain to manage supply chains.

A recent blog by Tim Bray, who used to work for Amazon Web Services, tells
us why Amazon chose not to implement a blockchain of its own: It couldn't
get a straight answer to the question, ``What useful thing does it do?''

So how did this enterprise, which never stood up to scrutiny, become such a
big deal?

It was probably a combination of factors. Political ideology played a role:
Not all crypto enthusiasts were right wingers, but distrust of banks -- we
all know who runs them -- and government-managed money provided a hard core
of support.

The romance of high tech also played a role, with the very
incomprehensibility of crypto discourse acting, for a while, as a selling
point. And then, as prices soared, fear of missing out -- plus large
outlays on marketing and political influence-buying -- brought many others
into the bubble.

It's an amazing story, and also a tragedy. It's not just the small investors
who have lost much if not all of their life savings. The crypto bubble has
had huge costs to society as a whole. Bitcoin mining alone uses as much
energy as many countries; I've been trying to estimate the value of the
resources consumed in producing fundamentally worthless tokens, and it's
probably in the tens of billions of dollars, not counting the environmental
damage.

  [Amusingly, Dewayne left out the last two paras, which I have added. PGN]

Add in the costs associated with other tokens and the resources burned up in
abortive efforts to supply a blockchain approach to everything, and we're
probably talking about waste on an epic scale.

No doubt I'll hear from many people still insisting that I don't get it.
But it really looks as if there never was an *it* to get.

Connel Fullenkamp (Duke prof.), *The New York Times*, 28 Nov 2022

Sam Bankman-Fried's downfall is spectacular, but it's really nothing new.

FTX's collapse had very little to do with either the characteristics of
cryptocurrency in general or the specific features of the coins that FTX
minted and distributed.  FTX failed because the people who ran the company
didn't follow some basic rules of finance that can be difficult to enforce
even in well-regulated markets.

And Sam Bankman-Fried is neither a visionary nor a criminal mastermind.  He
is just a human who made the same poor choice that generations of money
managers have made before him.

 Attack of the 50-Foot Blockchain (David Gerard)

The GDP of the United States ($20 trillion) is approximately a thousand
times El Salvador's GDP ($26 billion). So this is as if the US government
lost a quarter billion dollars to fraud due to a software error in an
internationally publicised flagship payment project, by telling a junior
developer to commit straight to production on his first day.

Subject: San Francisco Considers Allowing Use of Deadly Robots by Police
 (NYTimes)

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/us/police-robots-san-francisco.html

The San Francisco police could use robots to deploy lethal force under a
policy advanced by city supervisors on Tuesday that thrust the city into the
forefront of a national debate about the use of weaponized robots in
American cities.

The possibility is not merely hypothetical. In 2016, the Dallas Police
Department ended a standoff with a gunman suspected of killing five officers
<https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/09/science/dallas-bomb-robot.html> by
blowing him up with a bomb attached to a robot in what was believed to be
the first lethal use of the technology by an American law enforcement
agency.

Supporters of the policy, advanced by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors
by an 8-to-3 vote, said it would allow the police to deploy a robot with
deadly force in extraordinary circumstances, such as when a mass shooter or
a terrorist is threatening the lives of officers or civilians.

  [ACM TechNews noted an item on this by Janie Har, Associated Press, 30 Nov
   2022, via ACM TechNews, 30 Nov 2022, with no original URL.  ... despite
   objections from civil liberties and other police oversight
   groups. Although the San Francisco Police Department's Allison Maxie said
   while the department currently has no armed robots, and has no plans to
   equip robots with guns, it could deploy robots outfitted with explosive
   charges ``to contact, incapacitate, or disorient violent, armed, or
   dangerous suspects'' in life-threatening scenarios. City supervisors
   revised the proposal so officers could use robots only after alternative
   force or de-escalation tactics were tried or deemed ineffective. Critics
   said the authorization would further militarize a police force that
   already displays excessive aggression toward poor and minority
   communities.  PGN]

Edd Gent, IEEE Spectrum, 24 Nov 2022, via ACM TechNews, 30 Nov 2022

The Golfi robot built by Annika Junker and colleagues at Germany's Paderborn
University combines classical control engineering and machine learning to
putt with professional golfer-level skill. Golfi captures images of the
green through a ceiling-mounted three-dimensional camera, which feeds its
data into a physics-based model to enable the simulation of thousands of
random shots from different positions. A neural network employs this data to
predict the amount of force and direction required when hitting a ball to
get it in the hole from anywhere on the green. Junker said Golfi was
designed to demonstrate the capability of hybrid robotic control techniques.

A team of Cornell University researchers created the Notate interface to
translate handwriting and sketches into computer code. The pen-based
interface enables digital notebook users to open drawing canvases and to
handwrite diagrams within lines of traditional code. Notate is driven by a
deep learning model, allowing notation in the handwritten diagram to
reference textual code and vice versa. Cornell's Ian Arawjo said, ``People
are ready for this type of feature, but developers of interfaces for typing
code need to take note of this and support images and graphical interfaces
inside code.''

Parties to the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) approved
the cessation of the leap second for keeping Coordinated Universal Time
starting in 2035, until at least 2135. Leap seconds have been used to bring
Earth's rotation into alignment with atomic-precision timekeeping. In 2012
and 2017, they triggered multi-hour network blackouts at companies including
Reddit, Qantas, and Cloudflare. Many companies implemented a version of
*leap-smearing* to smooth out a leap second addition into micro-seconds
spread across the globe throughout a day. Engineers at Meta, a supporter of
the change, said the 27 leap seconds that have been applied since their
introduction in 1972 were ``enough for the next millennium.''

an *a* on the big-unit side and with a *o* on the small-unit side.

  [Ah yes, I knew that.  But suppose your native language is one in which an
  *a* ending is feminine (e.g., Latinate languages, Slavic, Greek), and an
  *o* ending is typically masculine.  This might be seen by mysongenists and

While China's communist government leverages Elon's #Twitter to bury the
current mass protests in China under massive waves of spam -- making Elon's
Twitter complicit -- we keep seeing the now usual ``We couldn't reach Twitter
for comment, they no longer have a communications staff since Musk took

This is unacceptable, and should be illegal. Every large social media firm
should be required by law to have a 24/7 staffed point of contact for
reaching the firm in cases of emergencies or other important issues
affecting people's lives. This needs to happen RIGHT NOW.

A Twitter analogy
https://mastodon.laurenweinstein.org/@lauren/109428279652717961

Often it's useful when looking at the online world to analyze it using
offline (brick and mortar) world analogies.

Imagine a big store that, in the name of *free speech*, permitted hate
speech purveyors to tack up their ugly missives all over the establishment,
and have uniformed members of their groups inside the store yelling their
obscene epithets at shoppers. When complaints are made to the store owner,
he asks you ``Why are you against free speech?''

While this approach would likely gain him some customers among the
hate speech contingents, how many other customers are likely to stick
around? How will his suppliers and vendors feel about being associated
with him as his actions become widely publicized? -L

Elon's Apple advertising rant
https://mastodon.laurenweinstein.org/@lauren/109435566630389630
Elon's ranting about #Apple apparently essentially ending their
advertising on #Twitter is particularly fascinating. If we assume for
the moment that he is genuinely perplexed by this and not putting on a
show in this respect, it suggests a deep lack of understanding about
how advertising works. Which would not be very surprising, since most
of his other ventures essentially never advertised. But effectively,
it's like expecting the advertisers that supported your radio station
when it was 24/7 gospel music to stick around when it became 24/7
explicit lyrics metal. Don't count on it. -L

More on Musk/Apple rumors:
My guess is that Musk was told Apple isn't taking any action right now and
Musk pushed for assurances so he could start pulling in money for his fake
blue checks for blue subscribers. If Twitter goes as predicted Apple (and
Google) will likely ultimately be forced to act, but they wouldn't want to
pull the plug prematurely, and I'd agree with that assessment. -L
