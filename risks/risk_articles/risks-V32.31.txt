Downstream impact from an unavailable system

The automated system had a technical issue preventing a plane change from
being passed to downstream systems. Operators noticed the change and manual
updates were performed as a workaround.  Either the workaround was not
complete or did [not?] address all affected systems.

Subject: Why cars are more "fragile": more technology has reduced reobustness

Some associates of mine have noticed problems with automobiles, often with
changes they do not like or want, like forcing the use of a start button
(and stepping on the brake) instead of simply turning the key. It means
things like the passenger being able to turn on he car just by turning the
key have gone the way of the AM-only radio or the crank starter. Now,
turning the engine on, even if you're not going to drive, requires getting
out of the car, sitting in the driver's seat, stepping on the brake, then
pushing the starter. Another problem is that a relatively inexpensive device
(like keys) that even in the most expensive cases never reached US$20, are
now replaced by transponders or keyfobs costing as much as $1,000.

And the cost of repairs has gone up as the capacity of most people to do
anything beyond routine maintenance has gone down. Technology has improved
features cars have, but it has come at a cost.

Cars in the past used relays to control functions because it was the least
expensive way to provide these functions. As microprocessors became ever
cheaper and had more functionality, they became ideal for use to do multiple
things in place of relays, programmable logic controllers, and other
circuitry. All that they had to do was connect them. Previously they ran one
connection (wire) to each thing being controlled. Then they got an idea:
create a network (bus) to connect the components. If the components could
simply only listen on the bus for commands addressed to them, you only need
one wire for everything, to send messages everywhere. This provides lots
more flexibility as all you have to do as add new messages with a different
command code and you can control a new device, but it makes everything more
"fragile."

Now, when I say "fragile," I don't mean the comment of Doc Brown in "Back to
the Future" in which he says a 1954 Buick crashing into a Delorean would
tear through it like tissue paper, i mean the systems are less "robust,"
less resistant to failure.

Systems built with centralized or "concentrated" architecture are more
fragile, more subject to failure because there are more critical points that
if any one point fails, the whole thing fails. On a car from the past, short
of the engine or transmission suffering catastrophic damage, the car would
continue to operate. Today, if the computer or the bus is damaged, your car
is inoperable.

Previously, a failure of the air conditioning didn't mean the car couldn't
drive, or if there was a problem with the power steering it doesn't prevent
you from putting the car in reverse. But today, so many systems are
connected in a very centralized architecture that one system can affect
another due to side effects. It also means that where before, just about
anyone with ordinary education and skils could repair most things on an
automobile with ordinary tools, today it takes a skilled mechanic with a
master's degree and $40,000 in equipment.

Distributed architecture increases robustness. Here are two examples.

The development of Blockchain technology has caused other industries to use
it beyond cryptocurrency. An example being a bank: crack their mainframe and
you can steal just about anything. But, if instead of breaking one computer
you have to get, say, all or a majority of all 100 branches to agree, it
makes it much harder to almost impossible to create a fraudulent
transaction.

During the Gulf War, despite saturation bombing, the coalition forces were
unable to shut down Iraq's military Command & Control systems; the messages
still got through. The reason being that the systems were built using
TCP/IP, the same communications protocol used by the Internet, and was
invented specifically for the US military to be able to continue to operate
communications infrastructure capable of communicating to troops in the
event of nuclear war. We found out under actual battlefield conditions that
"the damn stuff actually works."

These and other examples show that distributed architecture makes systems
more robust, while concentrated architecture makes systems more fragile. We
have traded increased functionality and cost savings, while sacrificing
robustness and less complexity. and the trend is likely to continue, unless
people get sick of these failures and demand better, or someone comes up
with better systems that are more robust and possibly simpler.

While that would be nice, I don't see that happening any time soon.

Subject: Space is becoming too crowded, Rocket Lab CEO warns (CNN)

In 1978, NASA scientist Donald Kessler warned of a potential catastrophic,
cascading chain reaction in outer space. Today known as "Kessler Syndrome,"
the theory posited that space above Earth could one day become so crowded,
so polluted with both active satellites and the detritus of space
explorations past, that it could render future space endeavors more
difficult, if not impossible.  Last week, the CEO of Rocket Lab, a launch
startup, said the company is already beginning to experience the effect of
growing congestion in outer space.  Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck said that the
sheer number of objects in space right now -- a number that is growing
quickly thanks in part to SpaceX's satellite Internet constellation,
Starlink -- is making it more difficult to find a clear path for rockets to
launch new satellites.  "This has a massive impact on the launch side," he
told CNN Business.  Rockets "have to try and weave their way up in between
these [satellite] constellations."

Part of the problem is that outer space remains largely unregulated. The
last widely agreed upon international treaty hasn't been updated in five
decades, and that's mostly left the commercial space industry to police
itself.  Rocket Lab set out to create lightweight rockets -- far smaller
than SpaceX's 230-foot-tall Falcon rockets -- that can deliver batches of
small satellites to space on a monthly or even weekly basis. Since 2018,
Rocket Lab has launched 12 successful missions and a total of 55 satellites
to space for a variety of research and commercial purposes. Beck said the
in-orbit traffic issues took a turn for the worst over the past 12 months.
It was over that time that SpaceX has rapidly built up its Starlink
constellation, growing it to include more than 700 Internet-beaming
satellites. It's already the largest satellite constellation by far, and the
company plans to grow it to include between 12,000 and 40,000 total
satellites. That's five times the total number of satellites humans have
*launched since the dawn of spaceflight* in the late 1950s.
<https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/02/tech/spacex-starlink-planet-9-x-scn/index.html>

It's not clear if traffic from its own satellites has also caused
frustrations for SpaceX. The company did not respond to a request for
comment.  Orbital junkyards.  [...]

Subject: Psychology study indicates that narcissists are more involved in
  politics than the rest of us (SagePub)

Those higher in narcissism are disproportionately taking part in the
democratic process, according to new research published in *Personality and
Social Psychology Bulletin
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220919212>*.

The study found a positive correlation between narcissism and political
participation. In other words: The more narcissistic someone is, the more
likely they are to contact politicians, sign petitions, donate money, and
vote in midterm elections.

``We have entered into an *Age of Entitlement* and a *post-truth* world
that combine to form an unprecedented cultural movement where large portions
of the public pursue self-interest and self-promotion above all things and
truth is whatever you want it to be, where alternative facts are given equal
standing with credible sources,'' said study author *Pete Hatemi*
<https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Ci8Ix08AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate>,
a distinguished professor at Penn State University.

``It is hard not to notice how much more of *me* is part of our world --
projecting one's status at the cost of others, whether using social media
such as Facebook or Instagram or Twitter. Gone are the days when
children's goals were to be something or do something important, replaced
by the desire to be famous. Tom Wolfe's vision seems to have come to
pass.''

``It was hard for my colleague Zoltan Fazekas and I to ignore the rampant
narcissism in our elected leaders, and the outcomes of their decisions. And
it seemed likely that higher public narcissism has some role in the growing
instability of our democracy, and in 2009 we began collecting data to see
if those higher in narcissism are taking a greater part in the political
process,'' Hatemi explained.

The researchers examined data from two nationally representative surveys in
the U.S. and in Denmark, with 500 and 2,450 participants in each,
respectively, and a web-based U.S. survey with 2,280 participants.

All of the surveys assessed narcissism and eight types of political
participation: signing a petition, boycotting or buying products for
political reasons, participating in a demonstration, attending political
meetings, contacting politicians, donating money, contacting the media, and
taking part in political forums and discussion groups.

The surveys also collect information about voting behavior and
sociodemographic variables such as gender, age, race, education, and
political ideology.  [...]

Subject: Can AI Detect Disinformation? A New Special Operations Program May
  Find Out (Defense One)

*Air Force, U.S. Special Operations Command fund year-long effort to train
a neural net to rank credibility and sort news from misinformation.*

For all the U.S. military's technical advantages over adversaries, it
still struggles to counter disinformation. A new software tool to be
developed for the U.S. Air Force and Special Operations Command, or SOCOM,
may help change that.

``If you don't compete in the information space, regardless of how good your
operations are, your activities are, you will probably eat a shit sandwich

of disinformation or false reporting later on,'' Raymond `Tony' Thomas, a
former SOCOM chief, said in an interview*.* ``We certainly experienced that
at the tactical level. That was the epiphany where we would have good raids,
good strikes, etc. and the bad guys would spin it so fast that we would be
eating collateral damage claims, etc. So the information space in that very
tactical space is key.

It even ``stretches to the strategic space,'' said Thomas, meaning that
disinformation can spread until it affects larger geopolitical realities.

Thomas now serves as an advisory board member for Primer, a company that on
Thursday *announced* a Small Business Innovation Research contract to
develop software over the next year to help analysts better -- and much more
quickly -- survey the information landscape and hopefully detect false
narratives that show up in the public space. [...]

Subject: 'Smart' male chastity device vulnerable to locking by
 hackers: researchers (AFP)

A security flaw in an Internet-connected male chastity device could allow
hackers to remotely lock it -- leaving users trapped, researchers have
warned.

The Cellmate, produced by Chinese firm Qiui, is a cover that clamps on the
base of the male genitals with a hardened steel ring, and does not have a
physical key or manual override.

The locking mechanism is controlled with a smartphone app via Bluetooth --
marketed as both an anti-cheating and a submission sex play device -- but
security researchers have found multiple flaws that leave it vulnerable to
hacking.

"We discovered that remote attackers could prevent the Bluetooth lock from
being opened, permanently locking the user in the device. There is no
physical unlock," British security firm Pen Test Partners said Tuesday.

"An angle grinder or other suitable heavy tool would be required to cut the
wearer free."

The firm also found other security flaws in the Cellmate -- listed for $189
on Qiui's website -- that could expose sensitive user information such as
names, phone numbers, birthdays and location data.  [...]

*Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps off a new #botnet that's

tasks, mostly #DDoS attacks, and illicit #cryptocurrency coin mining.*

Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps off a new botnet hijacking
Internet-connected smart devices in the wild to perform nefarious tasks,
mostly DDoS attacks, and illicit cryptocurrency coin mining.

Discovered by Qihoo 360's Netlab security team, the HEH Botnet
<https://blog.netlab.360.com/heh-an-iot-p2p-botnet/> -- written in Go
language and armed with a proprietary peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol, spreads
via a brute-force attack of the Telnet service on ports 23/2323 and can
execute arbitrary shell commands.

The researchers said the HEH botnet samples discovered so far support a wide
variety of CPU architectures, including x86(32/64), ARM(32/64),
MIPS(MIPS32/MIPS-III), and PowerPC (PPC).

The botnet, despite being in its early stages of development, comes with
three functional modules: a propagation module, a local HTTP service module,
and a P2P module.

Initially downloaded and executed by a malicious Shell script named
"wpqnbw.txt," the HEH sample then uses the Shell script to download rogue
programs for all different CPU architectures from a website ("pomf.cat"),
before eventually terminating a number of service processes based on their
port numbers.  [...]

Subject: 55 New Security Flaws Reported in Apple Software and Services
  (The Hacker News)

A team of five security researchers analyzed several Apple online services
for three months and found as many as 55 vulnerabilities, 11 of which are
critical in severity.

The flaws -- including 29 high severity, 13 medium severity, and 2 low
severity vulnerabilities -- could have allowed an attacker to "fully
compromise both customer and employee applications, launch a worm capable of
automatically taking over a victim's iCloud account, retrieve source code
for internal Apple projects, fully compromise an industrial control
warehouse software used by Apple, and take over the sessions of Apple
employees with the capability of accessing management tools and sensitive
resources."

The flaws meant a bad actor could easily hijack a user's iCloud account and
steal all the photos, calendar information, videos, and documents, in
addition to forwarding the same exploit to all of their contacts.

The findings were reported by Sam Curry, along with Brett Buerhaus, Ben
Sadeghipour, Samuel Erb, and Tanner Barnes over a three month period between
July and September.  <https://samcurry.net/hacking-apple/>

After they were responsibly disclosed to Apple, the iPhone maker took steps
to patch the flaws within 1-2 business days, with a few others fixed within
a short span of 4-6 hours.

So far, Apple has processed about 28 of the vulnerabilities with a total
payout of $288,500 as part of its bug bounty program.  [...]

Discovered by Paul Litvak <https://twitter.com/polarply> of Intezer Labs,
the flaws were reported to Microsoft in June, after which the company
subsequently addressed them.

Azure App Service is a cloud computing-based platform
<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/> that's used as a
hosting web service for building web apps and mobile backends.

When an App Service is created via Azure, a new Docker environment is
created with two container nodes -- a manager node and the application node
-- along with registering two domains that point to the app's HTTP web
server and the app service's administration page, which in turn leverages
Kudu <https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu> for continuous deployment of the
app from source control providers such as GitHub or Bitbucket.  [...]

Subject: CyberCommand has sought to disrupt the world's largest botnet,
  hoping to reduce its potential impact on the election (WashPost)

*The botnet is often used to drop ransomware, which officials fear could
snarl voter registration.*

In recent weeks, the U.S. military has mounted an operation to temporarily
disrupt what is described as the world's largest botnet - one used also to
drop ransomware, which officials say is one of the top threats to the 2020
election.

U.S. CyberCommand's campaign against the Trickbot botnet, an army of at
least 1 million hijacked computers run by Russian-speaking criminals, is
not expected to permanently dismantle the network, said four U.S.
officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter's
sensitivity. But it is one way to distract them at least for a while as
they seek to restore operations.

The effort is part of what Gen. Paul Nakasone, the head of CyberCommand,
calls "persistent engagement," or the imposition of cumulative costs on an
adversary by keeping them constantly engaged. And that is a key feature of
CyberCom's activities to help protect the election against foreign threats,
officials said.

"Right now, my top priority is for a safe, secure, and legitimate 2020
election," Nakasone said in August in a set of written responses to
Washington Post questions. "The Department of Defense, and CyberCommand
specifically, are supporting a broader 'whole-of-government' approach to
secure our elections."

Trickbot is malware that can steal financial data and drop other malicious
software onto infected systems. Cyber-criminals have used it to install
ransomware, a particularly nasty form of malware that encrypts users' data
and for which the criminals then demand payment - usually in cryptocurrency
- to unlock.  [...]

  ballot deadlines loom (Inquirer)

Pennsylvania's online system for registering to vote and applying for and
tracking mail ballots crashed over the weekend, triggering an outage that
stretched for more than 40 hours and prompted frustration from voters weeks
before critical election deadlines.

State officials managed to restore the site Monday morning and blamed the
problem on an equipment failure at a data center run by an outside
contractor. They did not believe any data had been lost or that malicious
physical or cyber activity was behind the outage.

  (Nicole Perlroth)

Nicole Perlroth, *The New York Times*, 3 Oct 2020,
via ACM TechNews, 5 Oct 2020

Philadelphia-based software provider eResearch Technology (ERT) was hit two
weeks ago by a ransomware attack that has slowed clinical trials. The
exploit started when ERT workers learned that they were locked out of their
data, and clients said this forced researchers to move certain clinical
trials to pen and paper. ERT's Drew Bustos on Friday verified that
ransomware had hijacked company systems on Sept. 20, when the firm took its
systems offline, called in outside cybersecurity experts, and alerted the
U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Affected customers included IQVIA, the
contract research organization helping manage AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine
trial, and drug maker Bristol Myers Squibb, which is leading a consortium in
developing a rapid test for coronavirus.

Subject: Flawed Algorithm Used to Determine UK Welfare Payments Is 'Pushing
  People Into Poverty' (Thomas Macaulay)

Thomas Macaulay, *The Next Web*, 29 Sep 2020

Human Rights Watch warns a flawed algorithm for calculating monthly social
security benefits in Britain is causing hunger, debt, and psychological
distress. The model measures changes in their earnings to dole out payments,
but the non-governmental organization said the algorithm only analyzes wages
people receive within a calendar month, and ignores frequency of
payment. This means people who get multiple monthly paychecks can have their
earnings overestimated, with their welfare payments dramatically reduced as
a result. Human Rights Watch's Amos Toh said, "The government's bid to
automate the benefits system--no matter the human cost--is pushing people to
the brink of poverty."

"It's true that the list of jobs that were once manual but which are now
done by machines with just a small amount of human oversight, or none at
all, grows ever longer.

"'When these robots are good enough, you don't necessarily want them to be
remote-controlled, you want them to be automatic,' he says.  'That's when
you cut out the workers.'"

Where staff shortages for certain roles are chronic and increasingly acute,
a robot substitute may be an optimal replacement choice. Robot life cycle
economics, like all machine v. human business investment decisions
(employment), augurs against people engaged to perform routine and
repetitive tasks.

I recall the *Scientific American* from Sep 1982 entitled, "The
Mechanization of Work", where robotic integration into manufacturing
processing, and other industries, was described. This issue also raised
economic dislocation prospects as a result of robotic substitution for human
participation.  https://www.scientificamerican.com/magazine/sa/1982/09-01/

Subject: Re: Apple marches to a different beat (Baker, RISKS-32.30)

Henry Baker reported that his Mac's clock was 2-3 minutes slow, and that he
couldn't see how to change the time server.

I administer a fleet of Macs, and they all use Apple time servers. Most use
time.apple.com; our Macs in China use time.asia.apple.com.

Three Macs chosen at random all have clocks matching the time displayed at
https://time.gov (to within 1 second).

That website, operated by the NIST (National Institute of Standards and
Technology), displays the official US time.  NIST also offers NTP (Network
Time Protocol) servers available at nist.time.gov

Apple has three default time servers depending on your location:
* Apple Americas/U.S. (time.apple.com.)
* Apple Asia (time.asia.apple.com)
* Apple Europe (time.euro.apple.com)

Changing the time server on a Mac is incredibly easy:
1. Open the Date & Time preference pane (in System Preferences)
2. Click the padlock icon to unlock settings
3. Delete time.apple.com, and type or paste the address of your preferred
   NTP server

Hope this helps Henry, and anyone else facing similar issues.

It's just you.

I'm typing this on a Macbook running MacOS Catalina, and its time agrees
with my NTP synced FreeBSD server to the second.

The MacOS date and time preferences menu has an option to NTP sync to one of
Apple's servers. It's turned on by default but you might check to see if
somehow you turned it off.

Subject: Re: Apple marches to a different beat (Baker, RISKS-32.30)

I've thankfully never had this issue, which is just as well since I do two
weekly radio shows for an Internet radio station, as well as occasional
online DJ shows.

I'm based in the UK, so my iMac is set to take its time signal from Apple's
European time server. I'm also still on macOS Mojave, as I've been put off
by the reports of issues with Catalina.

As for what might be causing the issue that Henry is seeing, I can think of
a few possible causes:

1. A problem with whichever Apple time server Henry's Mac defaults to.

2. A problem in the time synchronisation code in the version of macOS that
Henry's Mac is running.

3. Henry's ISP perhaps intercepting NTP traffic and making it go to their
time server, which is running fast.

I'll admit, the last one seems unlikely, but it's not as if ISPs have much
compunction against fiddling with their customer's traffic in the past. My
gut instinct, however, is that this is more likely to be a problem at
Apple's end.

System Preferences -> Date & Time -> Date & Time tab.

Unlock (using the icon in the bottom-left corner) if necessary.

The field labeled *Set date and time automatically* looks like a simple
dropdown with a set selection of options, but you can actually type in any
domain name you wish.

For what it's worth, my laptop syncs with time.apple.com and has the same
time as my cell phone (which receives its date and time from my carrier) and
the master clock time reported by the US Naval Observatory at
https://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO.
