Subject: There's not a creativity deficit in science

Don't use funding application statistics as a proxy for creativity.
Chris Lee, Ars Technica, 20 Sep 2014 (via Dave Farber)
<http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/09/a-creativity-deficit-in-science-no/>

Not so long ago, on a website not so far away, an opinion was expressed:
creativity was being suppressed in science. On the surface, the statistics
support this: younger researchers are getting progressively less of the
funding. Older researchers, it is asserted, tend to propose less risky and
less innovative research. As with any good opinion in science, Nobel prize
winners are wheeled as supporting cast. But, is it really true? Are we truly
suppressing the creative side of science?

The answer is, overwhelmingly, no. Scientific papers are a crude measure for
scientific progress, but never have more papers being produced per year than
now. Clearly, something creative is going on here. If you don't like
scientific papers, simply look at technological progress: your smartphone
would not have nearly as much punch without the creativity of scientists;
antiviral drugs were not found lying about on the ground; experimental
stem-cell therapies were not accidentally attempted. Behind all of these new
things lies a decade or more of scientific research. But, you know, thats
not creative at all.  [...  PGN truncated for RISKS.]

Bug in Bash shell creates big security hole on anything with *nix in it
Could allow attackers to execute code on Linux, Unix, and Mac OS X
Ars Technica via NNSquad

http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/09/bug-in-bash-shell-creates-big-security-hole-on-anything-with-nix-in-it/

  "The bug, discovered by Stephane Schazelas, is related to how Bash
  processes environmental variables passed by the operating system or by a
  program calling a Bash-based script. If Bash has been configured as the
  default system shell, it can be used by network-based attackers against
  servers and other Unix and Linux devices via Web requests, secure shell,
  telnet sessions, or other programs that use Bash to execute scripts."

And why do we believe them?

  *  Because we can read the source code and the protocol descriptions
     ourselves, and determine just how secure they are?

  *  Because they're a big company and big companies never lie?

  *  Because they've implemented it in proprietary binary software,
     and proprietary crypto is always stronger than the company
     claims it to be?

  *  Because they can't covertly send your device updated software that
     would change all these promises, for a targeted individual, or on
     a mass basis?

  *  Because you will never agree to upgrade the software on your
     device, ever, no matter how often they send you updates?

  *  Because this first release of their encryption software has no
     security bugs, so you will never need to upgrade it to retain
     your privacy?

  *  Because if a future update INSERTS privacy or security bugs, we
     will surely be able to distinguish these updates from future
     updates that FIX privacy or security bugs?

  *  Because if they change their mind and decide to lessen our privacy
     for their convenience, or by secret government edict, they will
     be sure to let us know?

  *  Because they have worked hard for years to prevent you from
     upgrading the software that runs on their devices so that YOU can
     choose it and control it instead of them?

  *  Because the US export control bureaucracy would never try to stop
     Apple from selling secure mass market proprietary encryption
     products across the border?

  *  Because the countries that wouldn't let Blackberry sell phones
     that communicate securely with your own corporate servers,
     will of course let Apple sell whatever high security non-tappable
     devices it wants to?

  *  Because we're apple fanboys and the company can do no wrong?

  *  Because they want to help the terrorists win?

  *  Because NSA made them mad once, therefore they are on the side
     of the public against NSA?

  *  Because it's always better to wiretap people after you convince
     them that they are perfectly secure, so they'll spill all their
     best secrets?

There must be some other reason, I'm just having trouble thinking of it.

Subject: Re: Wanted: Astronomer with Top Secret Clearance (via Dave Farber)

John Gilmore:
  The main answer is that the inmates have taken over the asylum, ...

Although I am in general agreement with John's outrage over the government's
discovery that secrecy in many forms can protect it from oversight ---
national security classification is only one of these; privacy is also a
great excuse for keeping things secret from the electorate --- I don't find
the need for a clearance for the director of the James Webb telescope
surprising.

The first thing that comes to mind is my recollection that the problem with
the Hubble telescope's mirrors was attributed to NASA's being unable to use
existing machinery for testing them because it was classified.  The range of
areas in which a major project like the James Webb telescope brushes against
secret technologies is broad.

I believe an astronomical telescope cannot be pointed at the Earth because
the Earth is too bright.  As John point's out, however, there are other,
much dimmer, objects like other people's spacecraft that it perhaps can look
at.  It also works the other way around.  The first space shuttle was looked
at by spy satellites to assess the status of its tiles; somehow they had
forgotten they could do this by the time tile damage was suspected but not
investigated on Columbia or perhaps the spy satellites did see damage to
Columbia's wing tiles and either didn't tell NASA or just didn't tell us.

The technology of the James Webb telescope must be closely related to that
of the spy satellites.  Giving the director an SI clearance doesn't
guarantee NASA access to all relevant technology or the assistance of the
agencies and companies that have it but I don't see any chance of that
without it.

Subject: The Internet of Thugs

Cory Doctorow's worst fears w.r.t. repossessed Internet-enabled devices are
now being realized.

Perhaps this is what Jonathan Zittrain had in mind with his "kill switches
for weaponry": "if you just make that next payment to the
U.S. military-industrial complex secret account in Switzerland, we'll
restore power to your tank/fighter-jet/etc. so that you can continue killing
your own citizens.  Thank you for your business!"

What next?  Internet-enabled Ebola medicines ?  "Please remit $10 million to
the Big Pharma secret lobbying slush fund, so that we can send you the Ebola
medicine enable code.  We're sorry for the temporary inconvenience."

FWIW, Cory's fears are my fears on this.  And in
the consumer space, self-stopping (rather than
self-driving) cars are only the beginning.

But I find many differences between the Internet-enabled shift from product
to service among consumers -- something I wrote about at length at
<http://yupnet.org/zittrain/archives/14> -- and an army ready to do awful
things with weapons, perhaps stopped by the heavy weapons' refusing to work
for anyone able to simply get hands on them.  The power dynamics are
inverted in the second example.

Why not? "Full access allows the developer of this keyboard to transmit

keyboard. This could include sensitive information such as your credit card
number or street address." ...

Head to your Settings app, then go to General > Keyboard > Keyboards.
Choose to add a new keyboard, and pick it from the list of third-party
keyboards. Finally, tap the new keyboard's name and choose to Allow Full
Access (not required for Swype).

You'll get a warning message about this, but it's required by the operating
system. Obviously, a keyboard can theoretically collect everything you type
into it; rest assured that well-known developers are keeping your info safe.

Subject: Re: Software ... sends ... Colorado driver's licenses to immigrants

IMHO the trouble is caused by using driver licenses where a "voter license"
would be required -- namely, a national citizen's ID card.

The insistence on not to institute any form of an official ID card had
resulted in using a driver license in most cases, which leads to such
contraptions as a "non-driving license" which is used as an ID and issued by
the DMV in some states, although it has nothing to do with driving.

Since states and the federal government manage every other aspect of voting,
why wouldn't they also manage voters identification?

Subject: The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System

Marshall Kirk McKusick, George V. Neville-Neil, and Robert N.M. Watson
The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System
Second edition, Addison-Wesley 2015
xxx + 886 + some useful unnumbered pages on videos and course materials

Excerpted from the preface:

  This book is about the internal structure of the FreeBSD 11 kernel and the
  concepts, data structures, and algorithms used in implementing FreeBD's
  system facilities.  The book covers FreeBSD from the system-call level
  down -- from the interface to the kernel to the hardware itself.  The
  kernel includes system facilities, such as process management, security,
  virtual memory, the I/O system, filesystems, the *socket* IPC mechanism,
  and network protocol implementations.

This is a truly extraordinary book -- extremely well written, comprehensive,
incisive, and timely.  It seems to have something for everyone -- software
developers, administrators, students, and others hungry for a single source
for a wide range of considerable knowledge and experience that is highly
relevant.  The second edition has roughly 1/3 completely new text and 1/3 of
the earlier text extensively rewritten, It can serve as a reference book, as
well as a valuable source for operating systems courses.

One of the major new additions in the 2nd edition is a chapter by Robert
Watson on security, which includes more conventional topics such as
discretionary/mandatory access control, audit, etc, but also more
contemporary topics such as Capsicum, disk encryption, and so on.  This new
chapter may be of particular interest to RISKS readers.

Whereas FreeBSD is used in its own right as a server OS, it is also an
open-source operating-system foundation for systems as varied as Mac OS X
and Apple iOS, NetApp's OnTap GX, EMC/Isilon appliances, Juniper Junos, and
the Sony Playstation.  Therefore, its security should be highly relevant to
RISKS readers.

Note: The preface says `FreeBSD 11'.  The book does describe things that
will ship with FreeBSD 11, but is also relevant for the existing FreeBSD 10.

Book Review by Richard Austin, 16 Sep 2014

Georgia Weidman: Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking
No Starch Press 2014
ISBN 978-1-59327-564-8
Amazon.com USD 28.11
Table of Contents:  http://www.nostarch.com/pentesting#toc

When the publication announcement for this book arrived in my EMAIL, my
first response was "Not another pen-testing book!" and I gazed at the table
of contents with rather of a jaundiced eye.  As you have probably noticed, I
have a fondness for books that require you to "do" as you read and Weidman's
chapters on setting up a virtual lab and introducing Kali Linux piqued my
interest enough to start reading.

Weidman wasted no time in starting to rack up credibility points as she
noted that in a penetration test, you simulate attacks by actually
EXPLOITING vulnerabilities rather than just identifying them (Chapter 0).
Then on page 3, she earned her "veteran" status by noting that even a simple
port scan of a device's management port can knock them off the air (in my
experience by crashing the on-board web server).

To avoid this becoming just another catalog of tools and dialogs, the reader
will definitely want to follow the procedures in Chapter 1 to set up the
virtual lab for the book.  Weidman makes use of Kali Linux which has an
arsenal of tools already installed and avoids much time wandering the
"dependency maze" in getting the tools to run. She wisely recommends that
you use the Kali version available on the book website so that her
walkthroughs will match the tool versions.  Chapters 2 through 4 provide a
brief introduction to Kali, scripting and the Metasploit framework that
prepare you for the detailed walkthroughs in later chapters.

With preliminaries out of the way, Weidman devotes the next three chapters
to the assessment phase of the penetration test.  It's a pretty standard
presentation of the usual tools (whois, nmap, Nessus, Metasploit, etc.) with
accompanying introductory walkthroughs in the virtual lab environment.

The next eight chapters are devoted to attacks, and this is where Weidman
starts to shine.  She makes the solid point that in a penetration test, you
have to go beyond identifying a vulnerability and actually exploit it where
possible.  And, most importantly, after a successful exploit, you have to do
something interesting (interesting to you as the pen-tester but damaging to
the customer if actually done by an adversary).

The catalog of attack methods is quite comprehensive and goes beyond the
usual exploitation of technical vulnerabilities and cracking passwords to
client-side attacks, social engineering (using SET. the Social Engineer
Toolkit) and evading anti-virus.  Chapter 13, "Post Exploitation", is highly
recommended for its coverage (and walkthrough) of how to capitalize on an
initial foothold to achieve further access within the infrastructure.  She
rounds out her survey of attacks with coverage of web applications (notable
for illustrating use of the Burp proxy) and wireless.

Weidman's next the important topic of "Exploit Development", and she spends
four chapters covering stack-based buffer overflows, SEH (Structured
Exception Handler) overwrites, fuzzing and development of Metasploit modules
for new vulnerabilities.  This section provides a concise, all-in-one-place
overview of these essential topics.

The final chapter covers Weidman's personal specialty: attacking mobile
devices.  As these wandering gateways into our infrastructures and
repositories of proprietary data have become increasingly common, their
value to our adversaries has correspondingly increased.  Weidman's coverage
of how these devices are attacked and use of her "Smartphone Pentest
Framework" are a valuable addition to the knowledge base of the practicing
security professional.  The walkthroughs are done using emulators, so
there's no need to risk "bricking" a real device when following along with
the text.

Through I started out with reservations about the need for
yet-another-pen-testing-book, Weidman's presentation has much to recommend
it to the technical security professional.  No book is ever going to make
one into a successful penetration tester but careful study and time invested
in following her walkthroughs will provide increased understanding of the
pen-tester's craft and appreciation of our adversaries' use of similar
techniques in the field.  Definitely a recommended read.
