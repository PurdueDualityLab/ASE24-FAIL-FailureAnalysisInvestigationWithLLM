Subject: The Midterm Elections Are in Serious Danger of Being Hacked,
  Thanks to Trump (Mother Jones)

*As President Barack Obama* prepared to leave office, his administration had
no doubt that Russia had mounted a devastating disinformation campaign and
hacked our electoral systems -- and would likely do it again.  But
President-elect Donald Trump was notably uninterested in the threat. When
FBI Director James Comey and other leaders of the intelligence community
visited Trump Tower in January 2017 to explain how the country had been
attacked, Comey recalled in his memoir, Trump's team had ``no questions
about what the future Russian threat might be.''  Instead, Comey wrote, they
launched ``immediately into a strategy session¦about how they could spin
what we'd just told them.''

The meeting set the tone for the administration. After four months as
attorney general, Jeff Sessions told the Senate he had not once been briefed
on Russian election interference, even though his department oversees the
FBI, which investigates Russia's disinformation campaigns and hacks like the
one in Illinois. When John Bolton took over as national security adviser in
April, he promptly pushed out two top White House cybersecurity experts. In
May, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, whose department also
plays a leading role in election security, Told reporters she wasn't aware
of US intelligence agencies having found that Russia aimed to help Trump;
she made similar remarks at a July security conference. The White House has
acknowledged just one Cabinet-level meeting on election security, and it
didn't come until May.

Subject: West Virginia to introduce mobile phone voting for midterm
  elections (Money.CNN)

West Virginians serving overseas will be the first in the country to cast
federal election ballots using a smartphone app, a move designed to make
voting in November's election easier for troops living abroad. But election
integrity and computer security experts expressed alarm at the prospect of
voting by phone, and one went so far as to call it "a horrific idea." ...

Ballots are anonymized, the company says, and recorded on a public digital
ledger called blockchain. Although that technology is most often associated
with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it can be used to record all manner
of data.

Oh, it's blockchain-based. OK, then.

Subject: Traceability (Vint Cerf)

NNSquad
http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/8/229771-traceability/fulltext

  "This suggests to me that the notion of traceability under
  (internationally?) agreed circumstances (that is, differential
  traceability) might be a fruitful concept to explore. In most societies
  today, it is accepted that we must be identifiable to appropriate
  authorities under certain conditions (consider border crossings, traffic
  violation stops as examples). While there are conditions under which
  apparent anonymity is desirable and even justifiable (whistle-blowing, for
  example) absolute anonymity is actually quite difficult to achieve
  (another point made at the Ditchley workshop) and might not be absolutely
  desirable given the misbehaviors apparent anonymity invites. I expect this
  is a controversial conclusion and I look forward to subsequent
  discussion."   Vint Cerf

While I have frequently called for greater accountability in key aspects of
Internet operations (in particular, public access to WHOIS domain data
except in limited circumstances), I fear that in the general case Vint's
Traceability proposal would mostly gladden the hearts of bad governmental
players in countries such as China, Russia, and even here in the USA. It
basically amounts to an escrowed identity system, a concept that has been
widely and appropriately criticized in the encryption arena. Given that a
significant degree of anonymity is crucial for human rights advocates and
others who live in areas of the world that are routinely under government
oppression, I do not see obvious ways that Vint's proposal could be
implemented without innocent parties being even more at the mercy of
oppressive governments than they are today.

Subject: Putin is afraid of one thing ... (Michael Morell)

Putin is afraid of one thing. Make him think it could happen.
Michael Morell, *The Washington Post*, 7 Aug 2018
http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/putin-is-afraid-of-one-thing-make-him-think-it-could-happen/2018/08/07/edbe08b4-998b-11e8-b60b-1c897f17e185_story.html%3Futm_term%3D.5dc2e012e179%26wpisrc%3Dnl_most%26wpmm%3D1

Facebook revealed on 31 Jul 2018 that it had discovered a 17-month-long
influence campaign sow political divisiveness on its network, an effort that
bore the hallmarks of the Kremlin-connected Internet Research Agency.  Two
days later at the White House, the nation's top national security officials
said Russia is conducting a pervasive campaign to weaken our democracy and
influence this year's midterm elections. Taken together, these announcements
leave no doubt that Russian President Vladimir Putin's political assault on
the United States continues unabated.

The most important question the Trump administration and Congress should be
asking is: How can we make Putin stop? Finding the answer is essential
because what Washington has done so far -- some improvements in defending
against these attacks, along with a mixture of targeted sanctions against
Russia, the indictment of Russian officials and organizations as well as the
expulsion of Russian intelligence officers from the United States -- has not
worked.

Stopping Putin is vital, not just as a matter of protecting American
democracy from Russian interference but also because we must signal a
stronger deterrence to other adversaries, such as China, Iran and North
Korea. Potential aggressors must be shown they will pay a price if they
attack. With better resources than Russia for trying to undermine our
democracy, China, in particular, needs to know that the United States would
respond by imposing a heavy cost.

The U.S. answer to Russia, so far, has been ineffective because Washington
has targeted only the entities and individuals actually involved in the
Russian information operations. Since the 2016 election, the United States,
at various times, has imposed sanctions on at least 10 Russian organizations
some more than once, and at least 23 specific individuals the sanctions'
targeting has had little impact on the Russian economy overall, the
political effect on Putin has been minor.

Here is what the United States needs to do. In terms of self-defense, it
must secure the nation's elections system, especially the software that
holds data on registered voters. Every vote should be tallied on a backup
paper ballot that could be used to verify election results, if
necessary. New rules and better enforcement are needed to keep foreign money
out of U.S. elections. The federal government should work with individual
campaigns to fortify the security of the technology and networks they
use. Finally, better coordination across the government is needed to protect
U.S. elections, which would probably best be achieved by creating a Hybrid
Threats Center similar to the National Counterterrorism Center.

Intelligence officials outline threats to midterm elections

FBI Director Christopher Wray and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen
Nielsen on 2 Aug 2018 discussed the disinformation attempts on the 2018
elections. (Reuters)

There are several bills in Congress, all with support on both sides of the
aisle, that would institute most of these changes and pay for them, but the
legislation is frozen by the partisanship this issue stirs.

As for imposing costs on those who attack the United States: Fully implement
sanctions already on the books. That is still not happening. But then move
beyond targeted sanctions to broad-based sanctions that are designed to hurt
the Russian economy -- just as the Obama administration's sanctions against
Iran were designed to do, as are the Trump administration's.  Make it clear
to Putin that we would drop the sanctions when he stopped interfering in the
democratic institutions of the United States and its allies, some of which
are also under siege.

What would such sanctions look like? A Senate bill introduced on 2 Aug 2018,
again with sponsors from both parties, is a good start: Prohibit any
transaction related to Russian energy projects and bar the purchase of new
Russian sovereign debt. Washington should encourage its allies to join in
these efforts.

Putin is afraid of one thing. He is afraid that one day the Russian middle
class will finally rebel against his regime and rush into the streets
demanding change.  It happened in Tunis, Cairo and other Middle Eastern and
North African cities between 2010 and 2012, and it happened most alarmingly,
from Putin's perspective, four years ago in Kiev when Ukrainians threw out a
government beholden to Moscow. Sanctions that bite at the heart of the
Russian economy -- sanctions that increase the risk that Russia's middle
class will become restive -- will get Putin's attention.

The leaders that the United States has chosen, and the security experts they
have appointed and confirmed, are aware of the threat. A failure to defend
the nation as well as possible, and failure to impose severe costs on those
attacking our democracy, would be seen by history as a major abdication of
responsibility. The statements from intelligence officials at the White
House last week were an excellent first step. More steps, and stronger ones,
are urgently needed.

  Michael Morell, a career intelligence officer, served as the deputy
  director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 2010 to 2013; during that
  period, he served twice as acting CIA director. He is the host of the
  Intelligence Matters podcast.

Subject: Old credit-bureau breaches (The New York Times)

These days I have been reading "Creditworthy: A History of Consumer
Surveillance and Financial Identity in America". It is an excellent study of
how the credit bureau / data broker industry started in the United States of
America.

I was amused by the inclusion of the following news item, which could have
been published yesterday:

http://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/22/business/credit-file-password-is-stolen.html

"Credit File Password Is Stolen", New York Times, June 22nd, 1984.

A password that could permit access to the credit histories of 90 million
people was stolen and posted on an electronic bulletin board, TRW
Information Systems said yesterday.

[...] TRW, the nation's largest credit reporting company, said its files had
been breached by someone who stole a password from a Sears, Roebuck &
Company store on the West Coast. The credit company said it changed the
password immediately after being told of the breach by an informant two
weeks ago.

The password could have been illegally used for a month, at most, and
probably a week, said Geri L. Schanz, a TRW spokesman. She said there was no
indication that merchandise was illegally charged. A preliminary examination
of the Sears account determined no unusual activity; a store is billed each
time its password is used and billings have not been higher than normal.
Miss Schanz added that the intruders would not have been able to change
information on the computer files.

But TRW is conducting an intensive investigation to find out who breached
the system and how. Ernest L. Arms, a spokesman for Sears in Chicago, said
his company was ''concerned'' about the TRW incident, but he would supply no
further details.

Computer experts yesterday said the breach again raises the issue of whether
the nation's companies and consumers are adequately protected.

Yes, it definitely raised the issue.

Forget that shiny new octocopter, a Bay-area startup wants to make your
Cessna 172 autonomous. XWing says
<http://medium.com/xwing/hello-from-xwing-b25451771a61> "plug and play"
software that can make most light aircraft fly autonomously. Details on how
it works have not been released but the technology will revolve around
"sensing, reasoning and control," according to aviation tech website
TransportUP
<http://transportup.com/headlines-breaking-news/vehicles-manufactures/automated-flight-startup-xwing-raises-4-million-in-funding/>
It will also work on helicopters and multicopters but its designer sees its
main benefit as making GA [General Aviation] accessible to the
masses. According to XWing founder Marc Piette the key is getting rid of
pilots.[*]  ``Getting a license and maintaining proficiency even on a single
[-engine] aircraft type is time consuming and challenging,'' he said in a
post on his website. ``Removing the need for a pilot will have a significant
impact in opening up the aviation market.''

Piette says that by eliminating pilots more people will be attracted to
aircraft ownership and that will increase demand for small planes. The
higher volumes will reduce production costs and make GA aircraft more
affordable, Piette theorizes. ``We see a bright future where people and
places are ever more connected, where small aircraft can finally take their
rightful place in the transportation landscape, and where autonomous flight
will have a profound impact on society as we know it,'' he wrote. Apparently
some investors are seeing that bright future as TransportUP is reporting
XWing has attracted $4 million in initial investment, including some from
Microsoft.

Germany's use of state-sponsored malware to fight crime is under fire from
several sides.
http://www.zdnet.com/article/german-police-hacking-hit-by-volley-of-complaints-can-state-trojan-law-survive/

Civil rights activists and politicians will in the coming days launch a
volley of constitutional complaints against the German government over its
use of state-sponsored malware in criminal investigations.

The first is that the recent law does not respect the boundaries set by the
Constitutional Court in a 2008 ruling, which said state-sponsored malware,
Staatstrojaner, can only be used to monitor ongoing communications, and not
to search people's computers.

The second part of the GFF's argument is that ``there is an indirect
detrimental effect on IT security as a whole.''

Ulf Buermeyer, the organization's chairman, said: ``To use one of these
state-sponsored malwares, authorities usually need a security flaw in the
system they want to target. These flaws can not only be exploited by German
state actors, but also by foreign state actors, or by plain criminals.  We
argue that trojans are detrimental to our security in general.  It creates a
strong incentive for state actors in Germany not to disclose security flaws
to vendors. We say this is a risk and the German legislature entirely
neglected this risk.''

Subject: To Fight Fake News, SETI Researchers Update Alien-Detection Scale
  (Scientific American)

http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/to-fight-fake-news-seti-researchers-update-alien-detection-scale/

SETI has created a new calculator to assess ET's signal to Earth. The
calculator uses enumerated input values, with a few range selection options,
to characterize the signal structure.

The ET-for-real-calculator can be found here: 
  http://dh4gan.github.io/rioscale2/. 

A peer-reviewed article published in the International Journal of
Astrobiology article discusses the Rio2.0 scale, a method to
characterize ET's signal as calculator input.

I think the risk here, common to all software stacks, is whether or not
it has been sufficiently qualified, especially for edge/threshold-
trigger conditions that might accrue into an accidental public alarm.

Hopefully, they'll be a few conscientious reviewers to evaluate the
signal and calculator output before an emergency broadcast commences.

Wonder if an adaptation can be automatically applied to various public
information sources (e.g., social media platforms) to quickly identify
bot publications w/o compromising free speech? The EditorBot might live
someday.

predict the number, they'll impersonate you. Computers, relying as they do
on human-coded patterns, can't generate true randomness -- but nobody can
predict the goopy mesmeric swirlings of oil, water, and wax. Cloudflare
films the lamps 24/7 and uses the ever-changing arrangement of pixels to
help create a superpowered cryptographic key. ``Anything that the camera
captures gets incorporated into the randomness,'' says Nick Sullivan, the
company's head of cryptography <http://www.wired.com/tag/cryptography/
includes visitors milling about and light streaming through the windows.
(Any change in heat subtly affects the undulations of those glistening
globules.)

Sure,/theoretically/, bad guys could sneak their own camera into
Cloudflare's lobby to capture the same scene, but the company's prepared for
such trickery. It films the movements of a pendulum in its London office and
records the measurements of a Geiger counter in Singapore to add more chaos
to the equation. Crack that, Russians.

Subject: Rich Irony from an "Unwitting" Liar

Is it just me, or is anyone else in computer science annoyed by James
Clapper's recent apology book tour, during which he blames everyone but the
intelligence community for Hillary Clinton's 30,000 lost emails?

Having been involved in the computer science field for half a century, with
a personal email history almost as old, I can recall the heavy hand of the
intelligence community in monopolizing encryption technology and
criminalizing its export.  The intelligence community's watchword: "NOBUS",
meaning "NObody But U.S." (may use high-quality encryption and
authentication).

This heavy hand made it impossible to incorporate encryption and
authentication into the fabric of everyday computer systems, and hence
impossible for computers to *routinely* protect ordinary communications like
emails.

Only after Bernstein v. United States (1999) and Junger v. Daley (2000) was
encryption finally permitted to become a fully integrated component of
everyday computer systems.

The computer science community thus lost *forty years* of experience and
software development that would have led to email systems capable of storing
Hillary's emails securely -- even in her home closet.

As the recent "Spectre" class of CPU vulnerabilities demonstrates, we are
still living with legacy of this intelligence community "unwitting" (I
prefer "witless") blunder.

I would like to repeat to James Clapper what my grandmother used to say to
me when I was a child: "when you point your (index) finger at someone, your
other four fingers are pointing at yourself."

I also have a better suggestion for the name of Clapper's book:

  "Redacts and Sneers: Half Truths from a Liar in Intelligence"

rather than

  "Facts and Fears: Hard Truths from a Life in Intelligence"

Subject: Socially engineering a whale ...

When you know who someone is, have followed their patterns, and know who
their friends are, you can get them to respond to phishing messages.

At least, that was the theory when DFO lured an orca away from the harbour
where he had taken up residence.  (And now someone is going to take issue
with "residence," since he was not from one of the resident pods, but was a
transient.)

http://is.gd/WHuq3X

(And, yes, I know that orcas are delphinidae and therefore not true whales ...)

(And, yes, I meant phishing, not fishing.)

(false positive, identification, identity theft, impersonation, phishing,
social engineering, social media)

(Oh, you want even more links to security?  Well, there is life safety,
since transients feed on mammals, and that's what we are ...)

Subject: Re: The Ordinary License Plate's Days May Be Numbered
  (Shapir, RISKS-30.78)

It always amazes me not many countries follow the UK approach, where in
normal circumstances the licence plate stays with the vehicle from
manufacture to destruction.

And I'm sure plenty of people will scream about the risks of ANPR (automatic
number plate recognition) but it works well - mostly - for us where a
computer in a police car scans neighbouring plates, then checks them against
an online database for tax and insurance. Traders have a special plate which
allows them to drive vehicles that are otherwise not registered, taxed or
insured.

This does, however, bring another risk into play. So many bills are paid
monthly now, including insurance, so if you aren't alert it's far too easy -
as happened to my daughter - for the insurance debit to bounce, the
insurance company cancels the policy, the ANPR picks up your vehicle, and
you get stopped for driving the vehicle without insurance.  And the
insurance company normally does NOT notify you that the payment bounced! In
those circumstances, you are supposed either to re-insure your vehicle, at
the roadside, by (smart)phone or the police will seize the vehicle. My
daughter was lucky - the police let her proceed when she couldn't contact
her insurers but many people have had their vehicle seized and it usually
costs about £200 to get it back!
