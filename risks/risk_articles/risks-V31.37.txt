If this leak -- discovered by Vpnmentor researchers -- has been exploited by

According to Vpnmentor blog, the database contains plaintext -- *not* hashed
-- passwords and biometric data for millions of users.

These users are employees of firms using the Biostar 2 access control

You can change a compromised password, but your fingerprint is not only

Subject: "Researchers Use Blockchain to Drive Electric Vehicle Infrastructure"
  (U.Waterloo)

University of Waterloo News (14 Aug 2019) via ACM TechNews, 19 Aug 2019

Researchers in the Cheriton School of Computer Science and the Department of
Management Science of Canada's University of Waterloo have incorporated
blockchain into energy systems, which could expand charging infrastructure
for electric vehicles (EVs). An open blockchain platform will give EV
owners, property owners, and charging service operators access to charging
data, and alert them to tampering; EV owners will be able to see whether
they are being overcharged for charging their vehicles, and property owners
will be alerted to instances of underpayment. Said Waterloo's Christian
Gorenflo, "Mitigating trust issues in EV charging could result in people who
have charging stations and even those who just have an outdoor outlet being
much more willing to team up with an EV charging service provider, resulting
in much better coverage of charging stations."

Subject: "Why blockchain-based voting could threaten democracy"
  (Lucas Mearian)

Lucas Mearian, Computerworld
As the desire to increase voter turnout remains strong and the number of
online voting pilot projects rises in the U.S. and abroad, some security
experts warn any Internet-based election system is wide open to attack,
regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
https://www.computerworld.com/article/3430697/why-blockchain-could-be-a-threat-to-democracy.html

selected text:

Even as there's been an uptick in pilot projects, security experts warn that
blockchain-based mobile voting technology is innately insecure and
potentially a danger to democracy through "wholesale fraud" or "manipulation
tactics."

Thirty-two states permit various kinds of online voting -- such as via email
-- for some subset of voters. In the 2016 general election, more 100,000
ballots were cast online, according to data collected by the U.S. Election
Assistance Commission. The actual number is likely much higher, according to
some experts.

"Tampering with mailed paper ballots is a one-at-a-time attack. Infecting
voters' computers with malware or infecting the computers in the elections
office that handle and count ballots are both effective methods for
large-scale corruption," Epstein said.

Subject: Critical Windows 10 Warning: Millions Of Users At Risk (Forbes)

As the Black Hat security conference comes to an end in Las Vegas, so the
DEF CON hacker convention begins. It didn't take long for the first critical
warnings for Windows users to emerge as a result. This one is particularly
worrying as, according to the Eclypsium researchers who gave the
presentation, the issue applies "to all modern versions of Microsoft
Windows," which leaves millions of Windows 10 users at risk of system
compromise.  What did the researchers reveal?

In a nutshell, the researcher found a common design flaw within the hardware
device drivers from multiple vendors including Huawei, Intel, NVIDIA,
Realtek Semiconductor, SuperMicro and Toshiba. In total, the number of
hardware vendors affected runs to 20 and includes every major BIOS
vendor. The nature of the vulnerability has the potential for the widespread
compromise of Windows 10 machines.

Microsoft Confirms Update Warning For Windows 10, Windows 8.1 And Windows 7
Users

The latest Patch Tuesday update from Microsoft included several critical
security fixes. Unfortunately, as Microsoft has now confirmed, it also
borked some things. If you haven't applied that August 13 update and are
running on Windows 10, Windows 8.1 or Windows 7, you may want to read this
before you do.  What's the problem with the latest Patch Tuesday Windows
update?

Microsoft has confirmed a bunch of "known issues" with the August 13 Windows
update. Some, such as the "black screen during first logon after installing
updates" issue, have hit users after previous updates. That can be filed in
the annoying but ultimately not much to worry about folder: it only impacts
a "small number" of users and only the first time they logon after the
update.

Anything that impacts millions of users is a far more serious thing. And so
it is that Microsoft has confirmed that this Patch Tuesday update does just
that.

"After installing this update, applications that were made using Visual
Basic 6 (VB6), macros using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), and scripts
or apps using Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) may stop responding
and you may receive an "invalid procedure call error," Microsoft has stated.

Subject: Cascading Effect of putting your data in a single cloud basket
  (Telus)

Most business and home TELUS e-mail customers have been impacted to a large
degree by an telus.net e-mail outage that began Aug 15 and is still
affecting some customers across Alberta and BC, as well as customers trying
to connect from elsewhere.

The outage was aggravated by the lack of information. TELUS kept saying that
the Root Cause was unknown until Aug 19, when reports began to surface
attributing the outage to a failed Dell EMC Cloud server repair:

https://www.telus.com/en/internet/email-outage

"This issue occurred during an overnight update to our servers in the early
hours of Thursday, August 15, in partnership with our vendor Dell EMC, when
a flawed repair procedure took the TELUS.net email system offline."

My experience was that pop connection attempts fared better than web mail or
imap. There is apparently some risk of at least temporary e-mail loss for
customers who kept their e-mail on TELUS servers, rather than downloading
it.

Generally TELUS has a well earned reputation for Continuous Availability and
ability to roll back failed updates promptly.

Businesses that have come to rely on e-mail for orders and other functions
have been heavily impacted. My personal view, using e-mail for work since
the 1980s, is that it is not yet a reliable or secure form of business
communication. This reminded me of Dr.  Nancy Leveson's analogy of Software
and the early days of high pressure steam. The economic incentive to push
ahead with unreliable, potentially unsafe, methods overwhelmed the voices of
caution. If you pushed ahead you made money faster, until the boiler blew up
on your workers.

Cloud seems to have been motivated by the idea of simplifying the addition
and management of servers and storage. Looks like there is some work to be
done to balance that saving against the risk of you and your customers being
impacted for days at a time if something in the cloud goes wrong.

Subject: Electric car charging stations may be portals for power grid
  cyber-attacks (Tech Xplore)

Electric cars are an essential component of a lower-carbon future, but a new
report from researchers at the New York University Tandon School of
Engineering raises the specter that plug-in electric vehicles -- and the
charging stations that supply them -- could be prime vectors for
cyber-attacks on urban power grids.

"In simulations using publicly available information about charging station
usage in Manhattan and the structure of the island's power grid, our
research team found that a fleet of just roughly 1,000 simultaneously
charging electric vehicles would be adequate for mounting an attack whose
effects could rival the blackout that affected the city's West Side last
month," said Yury Dvorkin, assistant professor in NYU Tandon's Department of
Electrical and Computer Engineering.

NYU Tandon doctoral candidate Samrat Acharya led the research in
collaboration with Dvorkin and Professor Ramesh Karri, also from the
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

"This simulation is a wake-up call to the public and policymakers, and an
encouragement to take steps to protect the data generated between electric
cars and charging stations -- most of which could be co-opted by a hacker
with college-level skills," Dvorkin said...

About 24 hours after the ads were approved, he got a notification telling
him the ad had been removed. He resubmitted it. It was accepted â and then
removed again â 15 or 20 times, he said. The explanation given: He had run
misleading ads that resulted in high negative feedback.â He understood that
it was Facebook's algorithm that rejected the ads, not a person. Getting
additional answers proved difficult, a common complaint with advertising on
Facebook. The best clues he could find came in the comments under the ads,
which he and his colleagues captured in screenshots before they were removed
and in responses to other posts about the project: There were phrases such
as The original moon landing technology. Some comments were hard to gauge,
with users insisting that the earth was flat but that they'd buy the book
anyway.

Subject: Re: These Legit-Looking iPhone Lightning Cables Will Hijack Your,
  Computer (VICE)

So this cable allows attacker to access to the connected computer.  The
implant must have a Wi-Fi component as well since accessing the computer via
Wi-Fi using the cable as antennae.

Silent or passive monitoring of data that flows data and sending it out via
low-power radio signal seems to be favored by spy agencies until Snowden
released such a trick in one of his documents in wikileaks.

I recall the USB cable for this purpose. Around 1996-2000 time frame, I
noticed a USB cable with mysterious embedded chip inside (inside the plug
portion).  I found it in a photo blog of a second-hand part shop in
Akihabara.  Initially, I thought this could be similar to APC's UPS control
cable that has some components inside (for proprietary connection, I
guesss.)  But it did not make sense, and the cable did act as ordinary USB
cable.

Years later, when I read the Wikileaks document, I realized that the cables
could have been used as spying tool.

My scenario was like this:

A large company bought a ton of PCs from Lenovo/Dell/HP/Fujitsu/NEC/etc.
you name it.  The agent that delivered the PCs first assembled them in a
warehouse before shipping them to the customer site (big trading
agency/banks or even a Japanese government office?).  Then the warehouse was
"attacked" and all the USB cables inside the PC delivery boxes were replaced
with this spying cable.  However, back then, rack computers were expensive
and scarce. Many startup e-Commerce companies used ordinary PCs sans PCs and
keyboards to act as rack computers. Thus most, if not all, of the delivered
keyboard and USB cables were dumped to second hand market.  Thus they were
sold at an outlet in Akihabara and noticed by the store clerk who
accidentally broke the plug and found the strange implant and opened a few
others and found the implants there, too. And since he posted the strange
USB cable that works in a shop blog with the photo and I noticed it.

Nobody knows how that cable was used for spying and where. Intriguing mind
wants to know.  The cable was so strange and this is why I remembered it
until I read wikiweaks document.

I think the true RISK here is an article like this that propagates the myth
that the password complexity rules from NIST's 1980s era document are STILL
a good idea.

I find it especially egregious that the author of this article chose to
reference NIST SP-800-63b while espousing overly complex password rules.

Permit me to quote from the appendix to that document:

  Highly complex memorized secrets introduce a new potential vulnerability:
  they are less likely to be memorable, and it is more likely that they will
  be written down or stored electronically in an unsafe manner

Worse, because it was touted on a large computer company website, this

Subject: Re: Password policy recommendations: Here's what you need to know
  (Lichtensteiger, RISKS-31.37)

Second part of sentence you quote: "but new recommendations have led to
changes around password policies". After recapping password history, article
notes new defaults, changes, resources:

      The default levels are changing

But in May 2019, Microsoft announced changes in the Security Baselines for
Windows 10 and Windows Server build 1903
<https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/secguide/2019/05/23/security-baseline-final-for-windows-10-v1903-and-windows-server-v1903/>:
The minimum and maximum password ages will no longer be set in the baselines
and therefore will not be enforced.

Microsoft cites research (see "An Administrator's Guide to Internet Password
Research <https://cormac.herley.org/docs/WhatsaSysadminToDo.pdf>" and "The
Security of Modern Password Expiration
<https://www.cs.unc.edu/~reiter/papers/2010/CCS.pdf>") to claim that
password expiration policies are no longer considered to have great
value. Other measures, such as checking lists of banned passwords, are more
effective. As they note, Windows Group Policies don't provide for checking
such lists, so neither can the Security Baselines, which is a good example
of why you should not rely only on the baselines. Microsoft offers some of
the more advanced capabilities in Azure AD Password Protection
<https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Active-Directory-Identity/Azure-AD-Password-Protection-and-Smart-Lockout-are-now-in-Public/ba-p/245423>.

      Password complexity: The ground rules

What is the default Windows password complexity policy
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/password-must-meet-complexity-requirements>?

  * The password may not contain the account name or variations on the
    account name.
  * It must contain characters from three of the following five groups
    (quoted from the Microsoft document):
      o Uppercase letters of European languages (A through Z, with
        diacritical marks, Greek and Cyrillic characters)
      o Lowercase letters of European languages (A through Z, sharp S,
        with diacritical marks, Greek and Cyrillic characters)
      o Base 10 digits (0 through 9); non-alphanumeric characters
        (special characters): (~!@#$%^&*_-+=`|\(){}[]:;"'<>,.?/)
      o Currency symbols such as the euro or British pound are not
        counted as special characters for this policy setting.
      o Any Unicode character that is categorized as an alphabetic
        character but is not uppercase or lowercase. This includes
        Unicode characters from Asian languages.

Everyone who has had to deal withÂ these policies, which are enabled
in the Security Baselines, knows what a pain they can be. As the Microsoft
document says, enabling the policies "may cause some additional help desk
calls for locked-out accounts because users might not be used to having
passwords that contain characters other than those found in the
alphabet. However, this policy setting is liberal enough that all users
should be able to abide by the requirements with a minor learning curve."

The default password length requirement
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/minimum-password-length>
is seven characters, but elsewhere Microsoft recommends eight characters, as
do the NIST requirements. In the Security Baselines, the minimum password
length is 14 characters.

The NIST policies specifically reject (though they do not ban) complexity
requirements. Microsoft has not removed the default imposition of these
requirements from Windows or the Security Baselines, but it may be a change
you want to make yourself.

If you want finer control of password filtering but want to stick with
Active Directory
<https://www.hpe.com/us/en/insights/articles/5-ways-to-see-whats-going-on-in-your-windows-server-system-right-now-1812.html>,
you can replace Microsoft's standard Passfilt.dll
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/secmgmt/password-filters>
with a commercial one or write one yourself, as Yelp did, based on an open
source implementation
<https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2018/04/ad-password-blacklisting.html>.
Examples of commercial replacements are those from nFront Security
<https://nfrontsecurity.com/products/nfront-password-filter/>, ManageEngine
<https://www.manageengine.com/products/self-service-password/password-policy-enforcer.html>,
and Anixis <https://anixis.com/products/ppe/faq.htm>. Using one of these
replacements, you can implement current best practices within your otherwise
standard Active Directory infrastructure.  SecLists keeps a collection of
many large common password lists.
<https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials>

      Beyond banned passwords

Banned password lists are useful, but another way may be better. Have I Been
Pwned <https://haveibeenpwned.com/> is a site that keeps records of major
user ID and password breaches and allows you to check whether any of your
logins have been compromised.

The site was built and is maintained by Troy Hunt, a Microsoft regional
director <https://rd.microsoft.com/en-us/> and well-known security
expert. It has data on 369 breached sites and 7,860,402,548 breached
accounts. The site also has an API that allows you to check whether a
particular account has been breached or just if a particular password exists
in the breach database.
<https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#PwnedPasswords> 

Hunt thinks that, once a list is as large as his, it is ``exceptionally
unlikely to have anything outside that collection which is both terrible and
actively used.''  The answer is to check against the separate Pwned
Passwords database <https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords>, which contains
551 million passwords that have been in one or more of the breaches, using
its API. Hunt says he would set a minimum of six characters and then block
anything that shows up in Pwned Passwords. One more tip from Hunt: ``I'd
block every variation of the company name; nobody on the Acme Corp. website
can use AcmeCorp, AcmeCorp1, AcmeC0rp, etc.''

If you want to use the Pwned Passwords API, you can build on one of the many
projects already doing so
<https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Consumers>. Typically, they create an
environment-native interface to the API, such as with the many PHP
libraries, Python and Perl scripts, WordPress plugins, and Java clients, as
well as an IFTTT recipe.

In addition to many weak passwords, Pwned Passwords has a large number of
passwords that would satisfy any set of complexity rules, so it might seem
to be overkill. But compared with the range of possible passwords, 551
million isn't as big a number as it seems. Nearly all of my own passwords
are randomly generated by my password manager, but I tested several
passwords I made up on my own in recent years, and none appear in the Pwned
Passwords database. So maybe relying on Hunt's API and a minimum length and
blocking organization name variants is the easiest route to strong
protection.

I wrote a program to check the contents of one of the SecLists lists of
`common credentials' against the Pwned Passwords database. All but 3,663 of
262,000 passwords tested were in Pwned Passwords, and more than half of
those that weren't had fewer than eight characters. Perhaps this means that
Hunt is right that checking banned password lists is largely redundant,
though if you're going to check one or the other, it's easy enough to check
both.

But all of this is about usernames and passwords, a technology that we
should all hope will someday be deprecated. At the same time you make sure
your passwords are strong, move forward with multifactor authentication
<https://www.hpe.com/us/en/insights/articles/with-webauthn-web-authentication-is-finally-getting-smart-1808.html>
and biometrics
<https://www.hpe.com/us/en/insights/articles/biometric-authentication-from-speeding-travel-to-providing-id-for-the-marginalized-1903.html>
that bypass the inherent problems with passwords.

      Password policy best practices: Lessons for leaders

  * Stay up to date with recommendations for creating and maintaining
    secure passwords.
  * Minimize opportunities for user password failures.
  * Make use of public databases of password failures and account breaches.

Except it didn't:

And the last sentence is a basically a lie. Even if that one station had
recorded an above zero temperature, it would not mean that 60% of the
surface was also melting.

Now from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), via the news website The
Local, the cooler reality:

Danish climate body wrongly reported Greenland heat record

The Danish Meteorological Institute, which has a key role in monitoring
Greenland's climate, last week reported a shocking August temperature of
between 2.7C and 4.7C at the Summit weather station, which is located 3,202m
above sea level at the the centre of the Greenland ice sheet, generating a
spate of global headlines.

But on Wednesday it posted a tweet saying that a closer look had shown that
monitoring equipment had been giving erroneous results.

``Was there record-level warmth on the inland ice on Friday?  No! A quality
check has confirmed out suspicion that the measurement was too high.''

Shoot out the headlines first, ask questions later.
