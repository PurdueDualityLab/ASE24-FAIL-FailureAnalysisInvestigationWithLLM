Matt Apuzzo and Michael S. Schmidt, *The New York Times*, 16 Nov 2016
http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/us/politics/china-phones-software-security.html

``For about $50, you can get a smartphone with a high-definition display,
fast data service and, according to security contractors, a secret feature:
a backdoor that sends all your text messages to China every 72 hours.
Security contractors recently discovered pre-installed software in some
Android phones that monitors where users go, whom they talk to and what they
write in text messages.''

``The Chinese company that wrote the software, Shanghai Adups Technology
Company, says its code runs on more than 700 million phones, cars and other
smart devices.  One American phone manufacturer, BLU Products, said that
120,000 of its phones had been affected and that it had updated the software
to eliminate the feature.''

Subject: Information Overload Chronicles: Hit Reply to All Shut Down UK
  National Health Service

One of the biggest problems in the field is two-fold: knowledge workers
frequent send unnecessary e-mails as an acknowledgment, namely of the
“Great!” or “Thanks!” variety, and users tend to mindlessly hit the
reply-to-all button assuming more is more.

These issues, compounded with the fact that almost no e-mail systems prevent
users from e-mailing hundreds of thousands of people let alone including
them in a reply, culminated with an unprecedented e-mail system meltdown
that brought health services in the United Kingdom to a full stop.
<http://www.frequentbusinesstraveler.com/travel-topics/united-kingdom/>

Earlier today, an e-mail created by an employee at the National Health
Service in the United Kingdom accidentally went to 840,000 employees
there. The problem didn't stop there: multiple employees clicked *reply to
all* and responded, thereby compounding the problem. Needless to say, the
e-mail server crawled to a halt and probably had smoke coming out of its air
vents.

Subject: Election Math

RISKS readers interested in election math might want to take a look at this:

Statistical researcher, Jonathan Simon, has been comparing
end-of-election-day polling data with the reported vote totals since
2004. His analysis for 2016 can be seen here:
http://codered2014.com/possible-election-rigging-seen-exit-polls/ You can
see his charts for the Presidential race:

and the Senate races:

His book (updated for 2016), can be freely downloaded from the
codered2014.com website.

Long-time election integrity advocate Bev Harris has noted the possibility
of stealth tampering via the GEMS election management system, which
currently tallies about 25% of the U.S. votes.  She has been recently
raising concern about the addition of votes via fractional decimals, which
are hidden in integer display.  You can read more about this in a 7-part
article starting here: http://blackboxvoting.org/fraction-magic-1/
This technique applied to siphoning off money from bank accounts [has long
been referred to] as Salami Slicing (or Salami Embezzlement).

Lucian Constantin, InfoWorld, 4 Nov 2016
Update your Belkin WeMo devices before they become botnet zombies.
Researchers have disclosed a critical vulnerability in Belkin's WeMo Switch
and possibly other devices.

http://www.infoworld.com/article/3137963/security/update-your-belkin-wemo-devices-before-they-become-botnet-zombies.html

selected text:

Owners of WeMo home automation devices should upgrade them to the latest
firmware version, which was released this week to fix a critical
vulnerability that could allow hackers to fully compromise them.

Tenaglia and Tanen said Belkin was very responsive to their report and is
one of the better IoT vendors out there when it comes to security. The
company actually did a pretty good job of locking down the WeMo Switch on
the hardware side, and the device is more secure than average IoT products
on the market today, they said.

  Another example of the Internet of Insecure Things.

Subject: $5 tool ransacks password-protected computers

  [Peter, when reading this story you, too, might catch yourself wishing it
  was April Fools Day...]

Dan Goodin, Ars Technica, 16 Nov 2016
Meet PoisonTap, the $5 tool that ransacks password-protected computers
http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/11/meet-poisontap-the-5-tool-that-ransacks-password-protected-computers/

The perils of leaving computers unattended just got worse, thanks to a newly
released exploit tool that takes only 30 seconds to install a
privacy-invading backdoor, even when the machine is locked with a strong
password.

*PoisonTap*, as the tool has been dubbed, runs freely available software on
a $5 Raspberry Pi Zero device
<http://arstechnica.co.uk/gadgets/2015/11/raspberry-pi-zero-sells-out-within-24-hours/>.
Once the payment card-sized computer is plugged into a computer's USB slot,
it intercepts all unencrypted Web traffic, including any authentication
cookies used to log in to private accounts. PoisonTap then sends that data
to a server under the attacker's control. The hack also installs a backdoor
that makes the owner's Web browser and local network remotely controllable
by the attacker.

PoisonTap is the latest creation of Samy Kamkar, the engineer behind a long
line of low-cost hacks, including a password-pilfering keylogger disguised
as a USB charger
<http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/01/13/meet-keysweeper-the-10-usb-charger-that-steals-ms-keyboard-strokes/>,
a key-sized dongle that jimmies open electronically locked cars and garages
<http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/08/meet-rolljam-the-30-device-that-jimmies-car-and-garage-doors/>,
and a DIY stalker app that mined Google Streetview
<http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/08/03/google_street_view_hack/>. While
inspiring for their creativity and elegance, Kamkar's inventions also
underscore the security and privacy tradeoffs that arise from an
increasingly computerized world. PoisonTap continues this cautionary theme
by challenging the practice of password-protecting an unattended computer
rather than shutting it off or, a safer bet still, toting it to the restroom
or lunch room.

Kamkar: "The primary motivation is to demonstrate that even on a
password-protected computer running off of a WPA2 Wi-Fi, your system and
network can still be attacked quickly and easily. Existing non-HTTPS website
credentials can be stolen, and, in fact, cookies from HTTPS sites that did
not properly set the 'secure' flag on the cookie can also be siphoned" ...
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access>

Unsecured home or office routers are similarly at risk. Kamkar has published
the PoisonTap source code and additional technical details, and has also
released a video demonstration.  <https://t.co/VZNji4Qwdo>

Once the device is inserted in a locked Mac or PC (Kamkar said he hasn't
tested PoisonTap on a Linux machine), it surreptitiously poisons the browser
cache with malicious code that lives on well after the tool is removed. That
makes the hack ideal for infecting computers while they are only briefly
unattended. Here's how it works.  ...<snip-snip>....

PoisonTap challenges a tradition that can be found in almost any home or
office -- the age-old practice of briefly leaving a locked computer
unattended. And for that reason, the ease and thoroughness of the hack may
be understandably unsettling for some people. Still, several safeguards can
significantly lower the threat posed by the hack. The first is to, whenever
possible, use sites that are protected by HTTPS encryption and the
transmission of secure cookies to prevent log-in credentials from being
intercepted. A measure known as HTTP Strict Transport Security is better
still, because it prevents attack techniques that attempt to downgrade HTTPS
connections to unsecured HTTP.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure>
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SecureFlag>
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security>

As a result, neither Google nor Facebook pages can be triggered by computers
infected by PoisonTap. Sadly, multi-factor authentication isn't likely to
provide much protection because it generally isn't triggered by credentials
provided in authentication cookies.

End users, meanwhile, should at a minimum close their browsers before
locking their computer or, if they're on a Mac, be sure to enable FileVault2
and put their machine to sleep before walking away, since browsers are
unable to make requests in such cases. Regularly flushing browser caches is
also a sound, albeit imperfect, measure. For the truly paranoid, it may make
more sense to simply bring laptops along or to turn off machines altogether.

Subject: Surveillance technology has advanced far beyond the laws that
  govern it

Ars Technica Live #2 - 26 May 2016

Surveillance technology has advanced far beyond the laws that govern it
http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/05/surveillance-technology-has-advanced-far-beyond-the-laws-that-govern-it/

UC Davis Law professor *Elizabeth Joh* predicts the future of high-tech
policing.

(Second episode of Ars Technica Live - video filmed in Oakland, California)

...interesting conversation with UC Davis law professor Elizabeth Joh, who
researches surveillance technology and policing.

Right out of the gate, Joh made it clear that the problem isn't surveillance
per se -- governments "need surveillance," she said, to figure out what its
citizens require in terms of benefits, help, and security. The problem is
when this surveillance becomes invasive, and the government inhibits freedom
of expression and punishes unconventional behavior. How do we balance the
need for surveillance and the need for free expression and privacy in a
democratic society?

Joh talked a lot about the future legal landscape we're creating with
cutting-edge technologies like self-driving cars, facial recognition, and
body cams. When you're talking about law and policy, the issue is always
that adoption of devices like body cams tends to precede careful thought
about what rules will govern them. After the Ferguson protests, for example,
police departments started using body cams as an accountability measure. But
there are no federal guidelines for how cops will use these cams. Will they
be able to turn them off whenever they want? Who has access to the data they
collect? Can they use facial recognition in body cams? All of these
questions remain unanswered, yet body cams are in widespread use across the
US.

A similar problem dogs our use of DNA databases, Joh explained. The US
government gives states financial incentives to develop databases and
biological sample libraries with the DNA of everyone who gets arrested.
These aren't convicts, mind you -- just anyone who gets arrested, regardless
of whether they were released the next day or found guilty of a felony.
Again, the question here is how to regulate these databases, as well as
other digital databases full of our "information microbiome." The key, Joh
argued, isn't going to be found in the courts or Congress. Instead, "public
vigilance" is the only social force that moves fast enough to push
government to behave responsibly with new surveillance technologies.

Of course, public vigilance is only as good as public information, and if
the public doesn't know what data law enforcement has, we can't push for
better rules. That's why the rise of private security forces is so
troubling.  Joh estimated that private security forces, from guards at 7-11
to "Target's private crime lab," are 3-5 times larger than public forces.
And they are not regulated by government in any way, which means that it's
impossible for the public to know what kinds of data private forces are
gathering.

In the question and answer period, Joh talked about the future of
surveillance tech in the US. Though self-driving cars may be great for
safety, they will also log everywhere you go. Who will have access to all
the information generated by these cars? She also believes very strongly
that robots will become a key part of law enforcement, whether via
surveillance drones or actual Robocop-style police officers who arrest
people. She's also very concerned about "predictive policing," or using
algorithms to predict where crimes will happen and who is likely to be
involved in them. The idea of "pre-crime police" is straight out of a Philip
K. Dick science fiction story, but it's not far from reality at this point.

  (Linthicum, R 29 91)

Apparently DL has never taken an Economics or Finance class...  *Of course*
there will be no depreciation or interest charges if you stop using your own
hardware. The cost just migrates up the Income Statement to the EXPENSES
section.

What you pay your cloud provider is a deduction in determining the
"earnings". You know the bit at the front of Earnings Before etc. etc.
Rationally, you would not elect to 'cloudify' if it cost more than the
actual costs (interest and the real depreciation rate) of the hardware, so
Earnings should be greater. And since you have NOT diverted capital funds
towards purchases of hardware, more actual equity can be invested in
increasing Income... Unless of course, the corporation actually has a
negative Return on Investment.

In which case, see United States v. Bernie Madoff, not as an example, but as
a warning.

http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2988290/avoiding_catastrophe_the_lessons_of_deepwater_horizon.html

  We must coldly examine how inherently dangerous systems work and how they
  fail, writes Earl Boebert, and then apply those insights to reducing the
  risk of failure through systems design, regulation, and education. That
  examination must apply the most modern and effective analytic tools. To do
  otherwise is to almost guarantee a repeat catastrophe.  [The Ecologist
  editor.]

This model will be a simplification and an idealization, and consequently a
falsification. It is to be hoped that the features retained for discussion
are those of greatest importance in the present state of knowledge.

A recent film casts the tragic fate of the Deepwater Horizon, her crew and
the Gulf of Mexico as resulting from a confrontation between two individuals
which the wrong person won.

What actually occurred was a classic 'emergent event', arising from the
interaction of multiple decisions and actions, the majority of which took
place weeks or months before the events of the film began.  [...]

Whether we like it or not, complex, high-risk / high-consequence systems
like offshore drilling exist and massive financial interests will [e]nsure
that they are not going away any time soon. Their safety results from the
interaction of technology, human action, and organizational dynamics, and
that interaction is far from simple.

If we as a society are to intelligently cope with them we must set aside
glib generalizations, ideological preconceptions and Hollywood
caricatures. We must coldly examine how such systems work and how they fail,
and then apply those insights to reducing the risk of failure through
systems design, regulation, and education.

That examination must apply the most modern and effective analytic tools. To
do otherwise is to almost guarantee a repeat catastrophe.

  [This is highly relevant to RISKS, especially as a possible reminder to
  the industry that bad publicity is not good for business, and that in the
  long run proactive care would be good business.  PGN]
