Subject: Russia Exploits Conspiracy Mill Americans Built (Nicole Perlroth)

*The New York Times* front page today 16 Jun 2020 [PGN-ed]

This is a remarkably comprehensive take on the saga that began in the Iowa
caucuses in February 2016, Robby Mook (who was falsely accused of developing
the app that came from Shadow Inc.), the Kremlin-backed Russian Internet
Research Agency, and more that continues today.

Clint Watts, former FBI special agent: "The Kremlin doesn't need to make
fake news any more.  It's all American made."

Russians have concluded that it is easier to identify divisive content from
real Americans [rather than masquerading as real Americans] and help it
spread through low-profile networks of social media accounts.

Cindy Otis, former CIA analyst: "Russia's trolls learned it is far more
effective to find the sore spots and amplify content by native English
speakers than it is to spin out their own wackadoodle conspiracy theories."

@DanRadov [who had earlier promulgated various Russian fake news as formerly
@DanWals83975326, and who is still active]: "U.S. has long been in the
position when one spark can burn the whole country down and all of the
United West for that matter.  Buckle your seatbelts people.  We are up for a
rough ride."

Subject: Fox News runs digitally altered images in coverage of Seattle's
  protests in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (sundry sources)

Fox News published digitally altered and misleading photos on stories about
Seattle's Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) in what photojournalism
experts called a clear violation of ethical standards for news
organizations.

As part of a package of stories Friday about the zone, where demonstrators
have taken over several city blocks on Capitol Hill after Seattle police
abandoned the East Precinct, Fox's website for much of the day featured a
photo of a man standing with a military-style rifle in front of what
appeared to be a smashed retail storefront.

The image was actually a mashup of photos from different days, taken by
different photographers — it was done by splicing a Getty Images photo of an
armed man, who had been at the protest zone June 10, with other images from
May 30 of smashed windows in downtown Seattle. Another altered image
combined the gunman photo with yet another image, making it appear as though
he was standing in front of a sign declaring “You are now entering Free Cap
Hill.”

`We are going to crush this lady': Six former eBay employees charged in
federal cyberstalking case targeting Natick couple

Travis Andersen, *The Boston Globe*, 15 Jun 2020

Six eBay employees including a former police captain in California last year
engaged in a relentless campaign of harassment and cyberstalking of a Natick
couple that published a newsletter critical of the online retailer, sending
items including fly larvae, live spiders, and a bloody pig mask to their
home and traveling to Massachusetts to conduct surveillance of the victims
in an effort to get them to stop publishing, authorities alleged Monday.

Subject: Spies Can Listen to Your Conversations by Watching a Light Bulb in
  the Room (The Hacker News)

You might not believe it, but it's possible to spy on secret conversations
happening in a room from a nearby remote location just by observing a light
bulb hanging in there -- visible from a window -- and measuring the amount
of light it emits.

A team of cybersecurity researchers has developed and demonstrated a novel
side-channel attacking technique that can be applied by eavesdroppers to
recover full sound from a victim's room that contains an overhead hanging
bulb.

The findings were published in a new paper by a team of academics -- en
Nassi, Yaron Pirutin, Adi Shamir, Yuval Elovici and Boris Zadov -- from the
Israeli's Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and the Weizmann Institute of
Science, which will also be presented at the Black Hat USA 2020 conference
later this August.
<https://www.blackhat.com/us-20/briefings/schedule/index.html#lamphone-real-time-passive-reconstruction-of-speech-using-light-emitted-from-lamps-20599>

The technique for long-distance eavesdropping, called "Lamphone
<https://www.nassiben.com/lamphone>," works by capturing minuscule sound
waves optically through an electro-optical sensor directed at the bulb and
using it to recover speech and recognize music.

How Does the 'Lamphone Attack' Work?. [...]

This has been driving us crazy all day...

T-Mobile Hit by Widespread Voice and Data Outage

"T-Mobile customers across the country are reporting issues placing and
receiving calls as well as when using data services.  The self-proclaimed
*Uncarrier* said it began to experience an unspecific network outage that is
impacting hundreds of thousands of customers starting in the early
afternoon.

``Our engineers are working to resolve the widespread voice and text
issue,'' the company said on its website.  It went on to recommend that
customers use third-party messaging.

I've noted in the past why this is a TERRIBLE idea. Yes, URLs can be long
and messy, but they frequently provide *critical* cues that you're on the
correct pages. Further tampering with them is an invitation to new kinds of
confusion and hack attacks.

The major items missing from the "Nutrition Label" is whether or not the
"Thing" will still "Thing" when the "Internet" is not and never has been
present.

Without that information it is impossible for any rational decision to be made and one must assume that the "Thing" will not "Thing" and is therefore completely unsuitable for use.

Good discussion of false negative/positive outcomes for polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) diagnostic tests.

"The PCR tests, when done perfectly, do boast a very low false-positive
rate. But they're not always done perfectly.

"Certified labs like hers use procedures to reduce the risk of false test
results, since a false-positive test can lead to a medical misdiagnosis. But
slip-ups are inevitable.

"Most errors are caused by poor sample handling or other errors even before
a sample gets to the lab, she says.

"And PCR is so incredibly sensitive, contamination is a particular concern.
Even the tiniest amount of stray material in a lab can spell trouble, Pritt
says."
