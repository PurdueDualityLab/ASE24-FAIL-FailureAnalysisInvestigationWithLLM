Subject: Too many pilots can't handle an emergency (David Learmount)

David Learmount, *The Telegraph*, 31 Dec 2014
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11318189/Too-many-pilots-cant-handle-an-emergency.html

Opinion piece in today's newspaper (Dec 31st, 2014) about pilots'
overreliance on computers to fly aircraft may be of interest for RISKS.
This is in the context of the recent AirAsia flight QZ8501 loss, but it also
appears to figure in Air France flight 447 plunging into the Atlantic 5
years ago.  The article summarises an FAA study (published last year) called
'The Operational Use of Flight Path Management Systems', which says:

  The FAA working group established that today's pilots have a number of
  vulnerabilities. The prime one is that if the automatics fail, the pilots
  are no longer practised in managing without them. This leads pilots to
  lose confidence in their own traditional flying abilities, so when things
  go wrong they have a tendency to try to restore failed automatic systems
  when, in fact, they should be flying the aircraft to keep it safe.

Incidentally, I'm certainly no expert, but I'd always assumed that iced-up
pitot tubes (for air-speed indicators) were a pretty routine problem for
aircraft?

Subject: Brouhaha brewing over single-operator trains

I've been a regular reader of (and occasional contributor to) RISKS since
the early 80s.  In all that time, I'm not sure I have seen a proposal that
takes as insufficient a view of the real deployment arena as this one:

http://bigstory.ap.org/article/89042513370f4b58a2e3545513f64435/railroads-seek-one-person-crews-freight-trains

Even if we ignore for a moment the long-term proposal of people-free freight
trains, going from two people to one would seem to benefit exactly one group
of people: the railroads that have to pay the other half of their road
staff.

It's not exactly like a failure on a 5000-ton train pulled by a 400-ton
locomotive is small and has little effect on the Real World...

What does surprise me in this AP piece is that AAR appears in *favor*
of one-person crews.  I guess it represents the railroad owners, though.

  [By reverse induction, the railroad owners would undoubtedly love
  zero-person crews, where I presume Jay and many other RISKS readers would
  not.  PGN]

Subject: "Could e-voting be on its way in the UK?"

A BBC Politics article at
   http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30234304
asks the question in the Subject.  The Political and Constitutional Reform
Committee of MPs has recommended that the government should run online
voting pilots in the next parliament "with a view to all electors having the
choice of voting online at the 2020 general election".  According to the
article, a fellow campaigner is Lord Malloch Brown, a former minister who is
now chairing an e-voting technology company.  Unsurprisingly, Malloch Brown
claims that his company's machines "are much more secure than postal votes"
and are "very advanced, with high levels of encryption", and that "the
results can be registered and collated before hackers have time to break
into the systems".  Hmm.

At least some of the Committee seem to be clued up, but the fear has to be
that political issues will weigh more heavily than the security and other
problems that have so frequently surfaced in RISKS.

Subject: Quick book recommendation

Here is a book I recommend to anyone interested in online voting: Kim
Zetter's Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First
Digital Weapon.

This book captures the zeitgeist of cyberattacks and cyberweapons better
than any other book I have come across.  It is technically accurate, but I
think extremely accessible to general audiences.  And it is a pretty
exciting and amazing story as well.  Although it does not event mention
Internet voting per se, you cannot read this book and fail to appreciate the
dangers that Internet voting would be vulnerable to.

Kim Zetter, of course, was an early journalist, and one of the best,
covering the voting wars a decade ago.

  A week after the app was introduced on its website, more than 4,000 people
  had activated it, the Samaritans said, and those users were following
  nearly 1.9 million Twitter accounts, with no notification to those being
  monitored. But just about as quickly, the group faced an outcry from
  people who said the app, called Samaritans Radar, could identify and prey
  on the emotionally vulnerable -- the very people the app was created to

Subject: Smart grid powers up privacy worries (David Perera)

FYI -- Why are we doing this?  Why aren't we spending this money on putting

David Perera, *Politico*, 1 Jan 15
http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/energy-electricity-data-use-113901.html

The next Big Data threat to our privacy may come from the electricity we
consume in our homes.

Smart online power meters are tracking energy use -- and that data may soon
be worth more than the electricity they distribute.

The Department of Energy is publishing in January the final draft of a
voluntary code of conduct governing data privacy for smart meters, 38
million of which have already been installed nationwide.  The meters gather
information about household electricity consumption and transmit it
wirelessly at regular intervals to the supplier.  It's a key element in the
push for the so-called smart grid, a more efficient way to distribute the
nation's electricity.

But, despite the voluntary code, critics fear consumers will still be
cajoled or conned into giving up their data, not just to power companies but
to third-party data aggregators.  Too much money is at stake, they say.  And
the huge profits to be made could upend the business model of energy
utilities.  [...]

wholes. It's not just Silicon Valley.  We see the same biases from those who

Malicious Git code repositories can execute rogue commands on client

http://www.infoworld.com/article/2861439/security/critical-vulnerability-in-git-clients-puts-developers-at-risk.html

A critical vulnerability in client software used to interact with Git, a

allows attackers to execute rogue commands on computers used by developers.

The flaw affects the official Git client as well as third-party clients and
software based on the original Git code. The issue only affects
implementations running on Windows and Mac OS X, not Linux, because their
file systems are case-insensitive: NTFS and FAT for Windows and HFS+ for Mac

ever larger and bloated "cyberwar" budgets -- to play this up as some

It has now been announced that Google Play/YouTube and other online venues
(possibly to include Netflix at some point) are either now or soon will
enable streaming of Sony's "comedy assassination" film (at least in some
countries).

I note this specifically because I do not support censorship even of this
trash, and I feel it is completely appropriate and admirable for the film to
be made widely available in the interests of free speech.

That said, this doesn't mean you're required to watch it. A film like this
is unlikely in the extreme to bring about positive change in a horrible
place like North Korea. If anything, it could drive their insane leadership
to even further internal repression.

So my *personal* recommendation remains to ignore this film entirely, and
not reward Sony's series of unforced errors that enabled this entire mess.

The account info used to access it is intended to be private but the zone

First, I'm not so clear on how "obvious" it is as I can't figure
out the reluctance and resistance.

That being said, I've been trying for years to convince Omnipoint (where I'm
both a customer and a shareholder) to offer dual-SIM phones.

This would be a useful option for people who currently carry around two
separate phones - one for their personal use and one for work.

- at least today most phones (with one key exception - that's YOU Apple
I'm pointing at) use the same charger.

This idea is not just disruptive but also stupid -- as others may have
noticed by now; if DNS is blocked in any significant way, vulnerable sites
would just revert to publicizing their IP address as part of their URL
instead of the site name, thus completely bypassing DNS lookup.

  "shed twice as much heat" is a typo?

Surely doubling the volts quadruples the power dissipated?

At risk of sounding like a total geek, in 220V Europe the mandatory wire
colours for power cords are:

Brown - Hot (live/phase)
Blue - Cold (neutral)
Green & Yellow stripes - Safety Ground (earth)

I believe that in North America they are black for hot and white for cold;
no idea what other territories use, presumably it depends on whether they're
110V or 220/240V.  Obviously for moulded cords it's impossible to verify
without cutting into the cord and damaging it, but the various territories'
safety authorities will need to be satisfied that regulations are being
complied with.
