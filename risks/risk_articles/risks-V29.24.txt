Subject: Errors in Scientific Software May Be More Serious Than Suspected

An article in Tech Dirt [1] "Frequent Errors In Scientific Software May
Undermine Many Published Results" notes that a number of technical articles
being submitted to scientific and technical journals for analysis and/or
peer review may have unknown errors because the scientific analysis used to
determine the results is often using custom software written by the
scientist - or more likely, by his or her research assistant - who is not
trained in writing software or may not be qualified to do so, and as a
result, the expected error rates for such software can be expected to be
much higher than even the typically abysmal rate of 15-20 defects per 1000
lines of code that professionals suffer with. Or rather, I mean "that with
which professionals suffer" since you're not supposed to end a sentence with
a preposition.

This potentially raises the odds that the results have serious, possibly
even critical errors in the results, making them questionable or even
downright worthless, by a large factor, and may result in serious
misapplication of resources as some results may be badly skewed or even
outright incorrect.

Subject: Cops hate encryption but the NSA loves it when you use PGP
  (Iain Thomson)

  [Note:  This item comes from friend David Rosenthal.  DLH]

Iain Thomson, The Register, 27 Jan 2016
[PGP] lights you up like a Vegas casino, says compsci boffin
<http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/27/nsa_loves_it_when_you_use_pgp/>

Although the cops and Feds wont stop banging on and on about encryption,
the spies have a different take on the use of crypto.

To be brutally blunt, they love it. Why? Because using detectable encryption
technology like PGP, Tor, VPNs and so on, lights you up on the intelligence
agencies' dashboards. Agents and analysts don't even have to see the
contents of the communications -- the metadata is enough for g-men to start
making your life difficult.

"To be honest, the spooks love PGP," Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the
International Computer Science Institute, told the Usenix Enigma conference
in San Francisco on Wednesday. "It's really chatty and it gives them a lot of
metadata and communication records. PGP is the NSA's friend."

Weaver, who has spent much of the last decade investigating NSA techniques,
said that all PGP traffic, including who sent it and to whom, is
automatically stored and backed up onto tape. This can then be searched as
needed when matched with other surveillance data.

Given that the NSA has taps on almost all of the internet's major trunk
routes, the PGP records can be incredibly useful. It's a simple matter to
build a script that can identify one PGP user and then track all their
contacts to build a journal of their activities.

Even better is the Mujahedeen Secrets encryption system, which was released
by the Global Islamic Media Front to allow Al Qaeda supporters to
communicate in private. Weaver said that not only was it even harder to use
than PGP, but it was a boon for metadata -- since almost anyone using it
identified themselves as a potential terrorist.

"It's brilliant!" enthused Weaver. ``Whoever it was at the NSA or GCHQ who
invented it give them a big Christmas bonus.'' [...]

Subject: Israel's electric grid hit by severe hack attack (Dan Goodin)

Dan Goodin, Ars Technica, 28 Jan 2016
http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/01/israels-electric-grid-hit-by-severe-hack-attack/

Israel experienced a serious hack attack on its electrical grid that
officials are still working to repel, the head of the country's energy
minister said Tuesday.

"The virus was already identified and the right software was already
prepared to neutralize it," Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz told
attendees of a computer security conference in Tel Aviv, according to this
article published Tuesday by The Times of Israel. "We had to paralyze many
of the computers of the Israeli Electricity Authority. We are handling the
situation and I hope that soon, this very serious event will be over -- but
as of now, computer systems are still not working as they should."

The "severe" attack was detected on Monday as temperatures in Jerusalem
dipped to below freezing, creating two days of record-breaking electricity
consumption, according to The Jerusalem Post. Steinitz said it was one of
the biggest computer-based attacks Israel's power infrastructure has
experienced, and that it was responded to by members of his ministry and the
country's National Cyber Bureau. The energy minister didn't identify any
suspects behind the attack or provide details about how it was carried out.

News organizations reporting Steinitz' comments gave no indication the
attacks on Israel's power grid resulted in any power disruptions.  A
representative for Israel's Electricity Authority said some of its computer
systems had been shut down for two days in response to the attack.

The attack comes five weeks after Ukraine's power grid was successfully
disrupted in what's believed to be the world's first-known hacker-caused
power outage. Researchers still aren't sure if the malware known as
BlackEnergy was the direct cause of the blackout, but they have confirmed
the malicious package infected at least three of the regional power
authorities that were involved in the outage. Researchers have since said
the attack was extremely well coordinated.

  [Bill Stewart noted that Dan Goodin's article indicated that the electric
  grid itself wasn't affected - the hack attack was against the Electricity
  Authority, which is a regulatory agency, not the actual power production
  organization, much less the power equipment.  PGN]

Subject: "Accidental sharing -- the plague of the always-connected era"
  (Paul Venezia)

Paul Venezia, InfoWorld, 25 Jan 2016
In the age of social media, it's not necessarily in a company's best
interests to provide clear and concise controls over information access.
http://www.infoworld.com/article/3025351/cloud-computing/accidental-sharing-the-plague-of-the-always-connected-era.html

selected text:

Via Facebook, a friend invited me to a surprise birthday party for her
sister last week, and I perchance ran into her a few days later.  We chatted
about this and that, then I asked about the surprise party. Her demeanor
changed as she described the difficulty in using Facebook to invite people
without alerting her sister to the event.  She wasn't certain she succeeded,
but after spending more than an hour painstakingly reviewing everything she
could find relating to who might be able to view the event, she decided that
she'd done all she could and fired it off.

Of course, it came back to her sister anyway, possibly because someone
inadvertently shared it on their own timeline.

It's not only social media; it extends to all kinds of consolidated cloud
services as well. This is how a father buys his child an iPad and signs in
with his Apple ID to buy a few apps. Later on, he discovers that his child
has seen every text message he's sent and received, every picture taken, and
various other items that perhaps shouldn't be on his daughter's iPad. He
only discovered this because someone called his iPhone and her iPad started
ringing too.

To a significant degree, the tech world is blind to the real-world
frustration and damage its "conveniences" can cause.

It's not realistic to expect the general population to fully understand all
of the moving parts that can lead to problems like this, to have to inspect
every new device, every new setting, every new app function or feature, and
so forth.

In an ideal world, the technology would adapt to our needs, not the other
way around. Unfortunately, it seems that those who are developing that
technology don't think that controlling access to communication is a
priority.

Millions of people are affected by identity theft each year. It might start
with a mysterious credit card charge, a bill you don't recognize, or a
letter from the IRS that says you already got your refund - even though you
didn't.

If someone uses your information to make purchases, open new accounts, or
get a tax refund, that's identity theft. Recovering from identity theft
often takes time and persistence. That's why today's announcement from the
FTC is a big deal: New features at IdentityTheft.gov make it easier to

Subject: Re: Why no secure architectures in commodity systems?

Perhaps we should say that "truly secure computing" is an ill-defined
term. However, without hardware support, two things are apparent:

Rule 1: Who runs first wins.
Rule 2: Rule 1 fails when the first move makes an imperfect move.

It's just like chess in this way.

The mechanism is called a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), and TPMs are
present in enormous volume in commodity computers of all sorts. This is
based on the Trusted Computing Group's efforts that stem from the work
on cryptographic checksums for integrity protection of the 1980s and on
a lot of other related things.

Again, the term "security" is ill defined. We can indeed achieve ill-defined
outcomes with software.

In effect, the hierarchy of hardware and recursive software embedding is
the same thing. You can do as well in software as in hardware, but it's
easier to make unbreakable enforcement mechanisms in hardware because
you can control less complicated finite state machines to great effect
and physically limit interactions (at the level of the digital - analog
interaction is still present of course).

> If this has happened, I would appreciate one or more pointers to the

The hardware architecture is present, but the industry lacks the desire
and ability to use it well.

This starts with the problem of defining what you want (i.e., "security"
is an ill-defined term) and continues to the problem of designing
something that does that (complexity is problematic, particularly in
multiprocessing / multi-threaded environments with overt and covert
communication between things you may want to keep separated in some ways).

Remember that we also tend to network these devices. Two perfectly secure
devices (meeting some specification such as limited information flow) when
connected may violate the flow controls of each other, thus a combination of
"secure" things may produce an "insecure" thing. The was all shown in the
1980s. If you want a secure system (from an information flow limiting
perspective) you can readily have one by [physically isolating it (to some
level of signal strength at some distance for all signal types and frequency
ranges). But these systems are of almost no use today.

The term "architecture" that you use is far more complex a thing than the
things you are discussing. Security architecture crosses many
boundaries. For an example you might want to look at
http://all.net/Arch/index.html

Subject: Re: Why no secure architectures in commodity systems? (Sizemore,
  RISKS-28.22,23)

* Michael Marking talks about insider threats in hardware design.

We have had Manchurian Chips in ATM machines and voting machines.  That's
where you can run all kinds of tests, based on the hardware design and never
discover that some additional features have been added, unless you have some
way to test every conceivable combination.  With voting machines, that also
involves moving your hands in combinations which make no logical sense..

In one case, a factory, manufacturing ATMs, was burglarized.  Afterwards,
everyone assumed that the only damage was some stuff they stole.  Only
later, it was found that they had gotten into ATM design to add additional
features.

The original design served the needs of financial institutions and their
customers.  The new design also served the needs of crooks desiring to steal
from the institutions and their customers.  A crook could visit the ATM, put
in their code (unknown to the institution) and get paper out listing
customer accounts, PIN#s, and available balances.  The crooks could put that
info on bogus cards, then withdraw as much as the bank allows in a day,
until customer account drained.

* PGN wrote of architecture which allows legacy code to run in confined
environments.

IBM came out with such a system in the 1990s, a year or two before the
AS/400 was launched, which also supported that.  These platforms supported
multiple partitions with different OS, human languages.  The primary
partition controlled how much disk space, and other hardware resources, were
allocated to each secondary partition, each of which ran their own OS.
These #s could be adjusted later.  There were commands we could use in one
environment to access others.  I remember M36, which was an OS running S/36
OS inside an AS/36.

We moved to a much faster system, with better security, using less
electricity, costing less to lease, and did not have to change any of our
old software.  The only problem was our ERP vendor which tried to argue that
their contract supporting perpetual upgrades, with no more $ investment, so
long as we stayed on a 36, was no longer running on a 36.  We needed to work
with them, because the ERP would only run on a machine with a serial # for
which they gave us a PIN#.

When we ran backup from the main partition, it included 100% of M36 as a
single object.  Our PCs also had access to a "special drive," which was a
partition on the AS/36.  PCs were backed up to that "special drive," with
each backup named after PC-involved, then all of that was another single
object in the AS/36 backup.  Restore from backup put everything back the way
it was, at backup time.

I thought it was way cool, that a multi-national company (my day job was NOT
one) could have main partition in English for technicians to manage the
whole system from, with other partitions in French, Spanish, Portuguese,
etc. serving their people in other nations, without the need to hire IT
people in those places, or use tech support, except thru HQ.  With the
cross-partition tunnels, employees could access the familiar software and
file structures, with the data of other corporate divisions.  There were
aps, where you send an invoice where customers & vendors see the info in
THEIR language.  Shipping goes thru customs @ some border crossing, and the
paperwork is in THEIR language.

I disagree.  The PC (micro computer) was launched in the 1970's.  Its
architecture totally ignored what had been developed on mini-computers in
the 1960's and mainframes before that.  I am not sure when midrange started.
It also had that architecture.

In the 1980's, companies started to connect PCs to minis, midrange, and
mainframe, forcing us to go to the current egg shell architecture, for the
overall company network.

* and it's too late now to change the course of history.

I agree.  The current approach dominates because people want the cheapest
possible, not the most secure possible.

Most people, who own and drive automobiles, learn by their second car that
life time operation cost can be higher than purchase cost, so their shopping
around needs to find one with good gas mileage, good warranties, good
service, few break downs, etc.  Most people never learn that about
computing.

  (Shapir, RISKS 29.23)

Amos Shapir wrote, "While Mark E. Smith's ideas are laudable, I'm afraid the
end result might be a political version of Wikipedia."

And that would differ from our current system in what way?

Shapir: "'The will of the people' is not a very well defined term, and
rather unreliable.  It has been shown time and again to be very susceptible
to cheap tricks."

The same is true of juries, however most people don't seem to think that
having elected judges make all decisions themselves would be an improvement.

Shapir: "What we need is a way to make elected officials behave like
responsible adults; I'm not sure there is a provable scheme to ensure that."

There isn't. RISKS has many illustrations of how security schemes can be
broken. Power corrupts and the more power a person is given, the more
temptation to corruption will confront them. In order to have elected
officials act more responsibly, it might be a good idea to start by removing
their sovereign immunity so that they could easily be held personally
accountable for their actions. This nation once fought a revolution to rid
ourselves of a sovereign, but somehow forgot to discard the concept of
sovereign immunity at the same time.

The Framers agreed with you, Amos. They feared the "mob and rabble" they
believed unfit to govern, and therefore wrote an undemocratic Constitution
that vested power not in the people, but in big land-owners, many of whom
had taken part in the genocide of Native Americans to obtain their land and
whose only right to it was a charter from a foreign sovereign, and who owned
slaves to work their land. Surely slavers and mass murderers could be
trusted to make better decisions than ordinary people, or at least to make
decisions that would primarily benefit other slavers and mass murderers.

But even among the genocidaires and slave owners, there were some who
foresaw that times can change and that change could not only be necessary,
but beneficial. As Thomas Jefferson said, "The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants." And
that was straight from the horse's mouth, as they say.  ;)

If the people are unreliable and susceptible to cheap tricks like election
campaigns (not that the billions spent on getting out the vote is cheap),
then why bother to have elections at all? If we want to retain elections to
indicate that we have a democratic form a government, then we have to
actually count the votes, to make the electoral process transparent and
verifiable, and to give the voters the final say so that the popular vote
cannot be ignored or overridden. Putting the lipstick of sham elections on
the pig of tyranny will never improve the quality of life for the majority
in this country. Giving the people a real voice in their own affairs
might. Iceland happens to be doing very well, thank you, although I'm sure
their democratic form of government sends shudders through the blackened
hearts of the US military-industrial-Congressional elite.

... caused by mismanagement, bad design, inadequate testing and probably
many more HUMAN.

In the 1960s I worked on a team that designed the first functional
mechanical system for publishing AND DELIVERING telephone books in
California and Nevada in some of the toughest neighborhoods from an
algorithmic challenge viewpoint.

Twisty little mazes?  Like San Francisco, and its front-doors-on-alleys and
cockamamie street alignments?

Carmel-b-the-sea?  (No house numbers.)

Los Angeles with its duplicate street names (among many other things).

We and our delivery contractor produces delivery lists for the
ring-and-fling areas which might run the odd-numbers for two blocks, the
even numbers on a side street for a block, the odd numbers in reverse order
on that street....and so one.

Subject: Re: Documents Uncover NYPD's Vast License Plate Reader Database

... with the rise of Uber, and more importantly, self-driving, dispatched
vehicles (owned by Uber or whoever), the question of how Uber and other
services co-operate with police department surveillance efforts becomes very
important. If most of us wind up not using our own cars to move around, and
instead, basically call cars on demand, these license plate databases and
tracking systems will ultimately become vastly less useful for this type of
unwarranted (literally) surveillance.

As a counter, once the police obtain access to Uber's records, they
potentially have access to a vast wealth of other information (see article
below) that might otherwise be difficult to obtain (such as your full
address book, and information about your location even when not driving).

Interestingly, while this seems to be a topic of conversation that everyone
leaps to when self-driving cars and transportation on demand come up,
several searches, several pages deep, yield nothing on the topic of police
surveilliance and Uber.

Subject: Re: Roger Kemp on the Lancaster Floods

In RISKS-29.22 Peter Ladkin said, "Is it progress to replace critical
independent systems with interdependent systems subject to single points of
failure?  Almost every standard for critical systems warns you not to do it,
but that's what we've done."

It is a symptom of overly reliable electric supply.  The longer people go
without a significant blackout, the less important they value resilience.
Other places in the world, reportedly Mumbai, experience up to 5 outages per
day and their citizens and businesses are so resilient that they hardly
notice.

The remedy IMO, would be to stage deliberate blackouts as training drills.
Pilots must drill on simulators.  Firemen must drill on their skills every
week.  The public and commercial businesses are never offered the
opportunity to drill and practice for electrical outages.

In a blackout drill, every one of the "surprises" mentioned in Roger Kemp's
narrative would have been exposed.   The public is then free to choose to
improve their resilience or not, but they could no longer claim surprise.

I wonder if it is legal for them to install jamming equipment in their home,
to create a cell phone GPS dead zone for their property.
They could run it except when they want to call out.
