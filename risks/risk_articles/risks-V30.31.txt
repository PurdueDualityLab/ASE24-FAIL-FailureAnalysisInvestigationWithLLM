  A new analysis by Eset shows that Turla is solving its C&C problems by
  using Britney Spears' Instagram account as a cut-out for its C&C
  servers. Turla moves the C&C server around, then hides the current address
  of the server in encrypted comments left on Britney Spears's image
  posts. The compromised systems check in with Spears's Instagram whenever
  they need to know where the C&C server is currently residing.

  "I'm going to show you one specific weapon in this war that's being used
  against you and me and the United States right now: Google. There are
  other information weapons, such as bots and fake news sites, but other
  stories have those pretty well covered. But before we get started, though,
  two things to keep in mind: First, most of us don't even know we're in
  this war yet. You don't know when you've been wounded, when you've been
  killed. And that's the whole point: You're not supposed to.  Second, the
  attacks in this war aren't aimed at your enemies.  You attack your own
  side."

  This week, EFF joined Creative Commons, Wikimedia, Mozilla, EDRi, Open
  Rights Group, and sixty other organizations in signing an open letter
  [PDF] addressed to Members of the European Parliament expressing our
  concerns about two key proposals for a new European "Digital Single
  Market" Directive on copyright.  These are the "value gap" proposal to
  require Internet platforms to put in place automatic filters to prevent
  copyright-infringing content from being uploaded by users (Article 13) and
  the equally misguided "link tax" proposal that would give news publishers
  a right to compensation when snippets of the text of news articles are
  used to link to the original source (Article 11).

If the EU proceeds with any of this nonsense, they risk being effectively
cut off the Internet from the rest of the world as far as most popular
services are concerned. EU citizens are being sold down the river by their
own politicians. Presumably they'll be cutting off the electricity next, and
bringing back The Plague.

  (RISKS-30.30)

This is the same guy who was fined by the Oregon Board of Examiners for
Engineering for calling himself an engineer in letters that he wrote to
them, based on an unusual and ambiguously worded Oregon law about licensing
professional engineers.  (It's not unusual to have a licensing law, it's
unusual for the law to have broad restrictions on speech.)

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/business/traffic-light-fine.html

Järlström sued them in federal court, and it's not looking good for
the state.  In a preliminary injunction last week, the state agreed
permanently not to try to prevent Järlström from speaking about
engineering or traffic lights or calling himself an engineer:

http://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Agreed-PI-signed-by-judge.pdf

It appears that Oregon is a slow learner.  Here's an article about a
case 20 years ago where they did the same thing to an academic
geologist who was testifying against a proposed project under a
professional geologist licensing law. They lost that one, too:

Subject: Re: "Red Light Cameras May Issue Some Tickets"

Oregon is one of the minority of states with a "restrictive yellow" traffic
law.  The driver is expected to stop at a yellow signal unless the driver
"cannot stop in safety" in which case the driver must "drive cautiously
through the intersection" and yet almost in contradiction to driving
cautiously the driver must also be clear of the intersection before the red
signal. The arguments in the case have to do with the definition of being
able to "stop in safety" based on many factors-- how far the driver is from
the intersection, how fast the driver might legally be moving, and even the
type of vehicle and whether the driver intends to turn. The length of the
yellow phase therefore is critical because of the requirement to be out of
the intersection before the red signal.

In the other 37 states, entering the intersection on yellow is permitted,
and only *entering* on red is a violation. I have learned for the first time
from looking things up just now that my own state of New Jersey is
restrictive while New York where I learned to drive is permissive. On the
road I have seen little sign that any driver in New Jersey knows about this!

Here, Appendix A, pages 19-23 give the rules state by state

Subject:  Re: Untold story of QF72: What happens when 'psycho' automation
  leaves pilots powerless?

If memory serves me correctly I heard MIT Prof Nancy Leveson say that one of
the reasons she rarely takes a flight on an Airbus plane is that Airbus and
Boeing have different philosophies about what to do when Automation and
pilots have opposite views of what the controls should make the plane do.

Dr. Leveson said that in the end Boeing will have the plane do what the
pilots want it to do, but they might have to use all their strength to
oppose the automation.

Airbus gives automation the last say about what the plane should do,
sometimes with disastrous results.

I believe that Dr. Leveson said she took an Airbus flight once, when the
alternative was spending a night in downtown Chicago.

There's another option than those four: vendors can arrange for the software
to stop working when its support period ends, and tell the customer to
arrange for an upgrade as necessary; whether that means buying a new
lightbulb, plugging a USB stick into their car, or just clicking the button
for "yes, ok, I give in, I will upgrade".

You might think this is dangerous; but then, so is the current state.  So
which is the greatest danger?  How bad would the state need to be before
this last option starts looking good?

Subject: Re: Robot Copilot Lands 737 (RISKS-30.30)

"The risk? Second Officer Robo Pilot not having been programmed for an
unusual and very bad situation. Say, a bird strike on both engines leaving
NYC's LaGuardia Airport or an incapacitated human pilot. Nice corporate
goal, "reduced crew operations while ensuring that aircraft performance and
mission success are maintained or improved" -- and it does mention
safety -- but I wonder about handling those occasional oddities where human
experience shines.experience. Aren't some aircraft designated two-crew for
good reasons?"

Right -- the pilots are there to deal with the designers' mistakes and
inadequate assumptions.  Shawn Coyle, a very experienced helicopter test
pilot, wrote that of all the many emergencies he had had to deal with, not
one was like those that the designers had told him to prepare for.  Without
him, the machine would have crashed, expensively.  Automation enthusiasts
have for decades been saying that pilots should be abolished; but in a
recent blog, an air transport pilot said that ``Yes, the aircraft can fly
itself, but the crew have their hands near the controls the whole time, to
take over when the automatic system messes up - and it does mess up.''

The greatest problem is over-confidence by the designers.  The Airbus Chief
Test Pilot was killed because he did not understand how the Alpha Floor,
which is supposed to prevent stalls, actually worked - which means it had
not been properly explained to him. And Air France 447, for example, need
not have crashed; but the designers and Air France assumed that pilots no
longer needed to be taught how to fly the aircraft when the automatic system
does not cope correctly.

This is found in other fields too, when it is assumed that complex logic
must be right; but the more complex the logic, the less likely it is to be
correct, usually because the input assumptions are inadequate or false (as
the Lockheed rep was quoted as saying about an F-22 problem,  ``There are
millions of lines of code in there and you can't check everything.''

None of this is dealt with just by saying that complex logic is now to be
called Artificial Intelligence.

And two-valued logic in itself has many limitations.

  conceptually unbounded precision!  PGN]

Much of that is quite true.  The problem is that the latest patched Windows
10 was still vulnerable to the WannaCrypt ransomware.

Worse, patches often contain bugs that can make things worse instead of
better.  For that reason, many of the more knowledgeable Windows 7 users
block automatic patches (a capability denied to Windows 10 users).  They
wait a week or more to see what other experience with new patches before
accepting them.

Since the end of 2014, Microsoft's record of patches has been dismal.
At least 39 patches issued since then were defective and had to be
replaced.  That is more than one defective patch a month.  Three
replacement patches themselves were also defective and had to be replaced.
