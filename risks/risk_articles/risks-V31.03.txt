Just because you can, doesn't mean that you should.
https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-is-my-keyboard-connected-to-the-cloud/

selected text:

Everything is becoming a thing connected to the Internet, but some things
really shouldn't be.

First cab off that rank should be input devices, because what sort of maniac
thinks the advantages of a roaming cloud-based configuration outweighs the
potential explosion in surface area to attack and compromise? That maniac is
called Razer, and it has been connecting keyboards to its Synapse software
for years.  At last week's CES, Razer took it a step further when it
announced it is adding support for users to use Alexa to control their
peripherals.  "Alexa, ask Chroma to change my lighting profile to FPS mode,"
Razer cheerily proclaims as an example of its upcoming functionality.

For this to work, the software that usually controls keyboard and mice
settings needs to be connected to Amazon Alexa.  Also in Razer's favour is
that it acknowledged it was responsible, which is more than can be said for
Gigabyte.

On 18 Dec 2018, SecureAuth detailed an exchange of when it discovered that
software utilities for Gigabyte and Aorus motherboards had privilege
escalation vulnerabilities.  "There is ring0 memcpy-like functionality
... allowing a local attacker to take complete control of the affected
system," SecureAuth said.  In the end, SecureAuth said Gigabyte eventually
responded by saying its products did not have any issues.

If a vendor with the experience and sales of Gigabyte responds by denying
responsibility for its software, it doesn't bode well for smaller players.

If a bad actor was looking for a shortcut into a modern Windows system,
trying to find your way in via Microsoft's code will be time wasting when
the Camembert-like underbelly of a modern system is likely to be crap
software from peripheral makers.

Subject: The Super-Secure Quantum Cable Hiding in the Holland Tunnel
  (Jeremy Kahn)

Jeremy Kahn, Bloomberg Businessweek, 14 Jan 2019

Commuters inching through rush-hour traffic in the Holland Tunnel between
Lower Manhattan and New Jersey don't know it, but a technology likely to be
the future of communication is being tested right outside their car windows.
Running through the tunnel is a fiber-optic cable that harnesses the power
of quantum mechanics to protect critical banking data from potential spies.

The cable's trick is a technology called quantum key distribution, or QKD.
Any half-decent intelligence agency can physically tap normal fiber optics
and intercept whatever messages the networks are carrying: They bend the
cable with a small clamp, then use a specialized piece of hardware to split
the beam of light that carries digital ones and zeros through the line. The
people communicating have no way of knowing someone is eavesdropping,
because they're still getting their messages without any perceptible delay.

QKD solves this problem by taking advantage of the quantum physics notion
that light -- normally thought of as a wave -- can also behave like a
particle.  At each end of the fiber-optic line, QKD systems, which from the
outside look like the generic black-box servers you might find in any data
center, use lasers to fire data in weak pulses of light, each just a little
bigger than a single photon. If any of the pulses' paths are interrupted and
they don't arrive at the endpoint at the expected nanosecond, the sender and
receiver know their communication has been compromised.

Subject: A Worldwide Hacking Spree Uses DNS Trickery to Nab Data (WiReD)

Iranian hackers have been busy lately, ramping up an array of targeted
attacks across the Middle East and abroad. And a report this week from the
threat intelligence firm FireEye details a massive global data-snatching
campaign, carried out over the last two years, that the firm has
preliminarily linked to Iran.

Using a classic tactic to undermine data security as it moves across the
web, hackers have grabbed sensitive data like login credentials and business
details from telecoms, Internet service providers, government organizations,
and other institutions in the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and North
America. FireEye researchers say the targets and types of data stolen are
consistent with Iranian government espionage interests -- and that whoever
is behind the massive assault now has a trove of data that could fuel future
cyberattacks for years.

Subject: Dark markets have evolved to use encrypted messengers/dead-drops
  (Cory Doctorow)

  [Note: This item comes from friend David Rosenthal.  DLH]

Cory Doctorow, Jan 14 2019
Dark markets have evolved to use encrypted messengers and dead-drops

https://boingboing.net/2019/01/14/drone-serviced-dead-drops.html

Cryptocurrencies and Tor hidden services ushered in a new golden age for
markets in illegal goods, especially banned or circumscribed drugs: Bitcoin
was widely (and incorrectly) viewed as intrinsically anonymous, while the
marketplaces themselves were significantly safer and more reliable than
traditional criminal markets, and as sellers realized real savings in losses
due to law enforcement and related risks, the prices of their merchandise
plummeted, while their profits soared.

But much of the security of dark markets was an illusion. The anonymity of
cryptocurrencies could often be pierced; the services themselves could be
subverted by law enforcement in order to roll up many sellers and buyers at
once; and the "last mile" problem of shipping illegal substances through the
mails exposed buyers and sellers to real risks.

The buyers and sellers in dark markets have responded to these revelations
and new facts on the ground with a range of ingenious, high-tech
countermeasures.

Buyers are now more likely to conduct sales negotiations through encrypted
messenger technologies, and each customer is assigned their own unique
contact, staffed by a bot that can answer questions on pricing and
availability and broker transactions. Many of these transactions now take
place through "private cryptocurrencies" that have improved anonymity
functions (there is a lot of development on these technologies).

Delivery is now largely managed through single-use "dead drops" --
hidden-in-plain-sight caches that are pre-seeded by sellers, who sometimes
use low-cost Bluetooth beacons to identify them (these beacons can be
programmed to activate only in the presence of a wifi network with a
specific name: a seller provides the buyer with a codeword and a GPS
coordinate; the buyer goes to the assigned place and creates a wifi network
on their phone with the codeword for its name, and this activates the
Bluetooth beacon that guides the buyer to their merchandise).

The logistics of these dead-drops are fascinating: there's a hierarchy on
the distribution side, with procurers who source merchandise and smuggle it
into each region; sellers who divide the smuggled goods into portions sized
for individual transactions, and sellers, whose "product" is just a set of
locations and secret words that they give to buyers.

The hierarchy creates the need for auditing and traitor-tracing to prevent
the different layers from ripping each other off. Dead drops are randomly
audited and audits are verified by reporting on the contents of unique
printed codes that accompany each drop. Distributors post cryptocurrency
"security" (bonds) with sellers and lose their deposits when their dead
drops fail.

In a fascinating paper on the rise of these "dropgangs," Jonathan "smuggler"
Logan identifies some key weaknesses in the scheme, including the
persistence of trackable coins being spent by buyers at the end of the
transaction (dropgang members are more likely to adopt private coins than
buyers); and the lack of the buyer-and-seller reputation systems that the
dark markets provide.

Logan proposes that this can be resolved with "proofs of sale" that would be
published on public forums, which increases the risk from law enforcement.

Logan also proposes that ultrasonic chirps may replace Bluetooth beacons,
with per-drop codephrases doing a call-and-response to help buyers home in
on their purchases.

Subject: A Simple Bug Makes It Easy to Spoof Google Search Results into
  Spreading Misinformation (Zack Whittaker)

Zack Whittaker, TechCrunch, 09 Jan 2019 via ACM TechNews, 14 Jan 2019

A bug discovered in Google by security researcher Wietze Beukema can be
exploited to generate misinformation by distributing rigged search
results. Beukema said values from a Google search result's "knowledge graph"
can be spliced together to spread false information, because the shareable
URL entered into a search result can be segmented and added to the Web
address of any other search query. A malefactor can easily put the contents
of a knowledge card within a search result; the rigged query does not break
HTTPS, so anyone can craft a link, send it in an email or tweet, or share it
on Facebook without arousing the recipient's suspicions. Beukema said anyone
can "generate normal-looking Google URLs that make controversial
assertions," which can "either look bad on Google, or worse, people will
accept them as being true." He also said his report of the bug to Google in
December was closed with the company taking no corrective action.

Subject: Chinese Internet censors turn attention to rest of world
  (MIT Tech Review)

When Chinese hackers declared war on the rest of us

Many thought the Internet would bring democracy to China. Instead it
empowered rampant government oppression, and now the censors are turning
their attention to the rest of the world.

EXCERPT:

Late one Wednesday in March 2015, an alarm sounded in the offices of GitHub,
a San Francisco-based software firm. The company's offices exemplified the
kind of Scandinavia-meets-soul-lessness style that has spread out from
Silicon Valley to take over modern workplaces: exposed wood, open spaces,
and lots of natural light. Most employees were preparing to leave, if they
hadn't already. Outside, the sun had started to set and it was balmy and
clear.

Alarms weren't uncommon at GitHub. The company claims to maintain the
largest repository of computer code in the world. It had some 14 million
users at the time, and prides itself on maintaining its service and staying
online. GitHub's core product is a set of editing tools that allow large
numbers of programmers to collaborate on software and keep track of changes
as bugs are fixed. In October 2018, Microsoft would buy it for $7.5 billion.

Back in 2015, though, GitHub was still an up-and-coming, independent
company whose success came from making it considerably easier for other
people to create computer software. The first alarm indicated there was a
large amount of incoming traffic to several projects stored on GitHub. This
could be innocent -- maybe a company had just launched a big new update
-- or something more sinister. Depending on how the traffic was clustered, more
alarms would sound if the sudden influx was impacting service sitewide. The
alarms sounded. GitHub was being DDoS-ed.

One of the most frequent causes of any website going down is a sharp spike
in traffic. Servers get overwhelmed with requests, causing them to crash or
slow to a torturous grind. Sometimes this happens simply because the website
suddenly becomes popular. Other times, as in a distributed denial of service
(DDoS) attack, the spike is maliciously engineered. In recent years, such
attacks have grown more common: hackers have taken to infecting large
numbers of computers with viruses, which they then use to take control of
the computers, enlisting them in the DDoS attack.

In the company's internal chat room, GitHub engineers realized they would be
tackling the attack *for some time*.  As the hours stretched into days, it
became something of a competition between the GitHub engineers and whoever
was on the other end of the attack. Working long, frantic shifts, the team
didn't have much time to speculate about the attackers' identity.  As rumors
abounded online, GitHub would only say, ``We believe the intent of this
attack is to convince us to remove a specific class of content.''  About a
20-minute drive away, across San Francisco Bay, Nicholas Weaver thought he
knew the culprit: China.  ``We are currently experiencing the largest DDoS
attack in GitHub's history,'' senior developer Jesse Newland wrote in a blog
post almost 24 hours after the attack had begun. Over the next five days, as
engineers spent 120 hours combating the attack, GitHub went down nine
times. It was like a hydra: every time the team thought they had a handle on
it, the attack adapted and redoubled its efforts. GitHub wouldn't comment on
the record, but a team member who spoke to me anonymously said it was ``very
obvious that this was something we'd never seen before.''

Weaver is a network-security expert at the International Computer Science
Institute, a research center in Berkeley, California. Together with other
researchers, he helped pinpoint the targets of the attack: two GitHub-hosted
projects connected to GreatFire.org, a China-based anti-censorship
organization. The two projects enabled users in China to visit both
GreatFire's website and the Chinese-language version of *the New York Times,
both of which are normally inaccessible to users in China.  GreatFire,
dubbed a foreign anti-Chinese organization by the Cyberspace Administration
of China, had long been a target of DDoS and hacking attacks, which is why
it moved some of its services to GitHub, where they were nominally out of
harm's way.

``Whoever was controlling the Great Cannon would use it to selectively
insert malicious JavaScript code into search queries and advertisements
served by Baidu, a popular Chinese search engine. That code then directed
enormous amounts of traffic to the cannon's targets.''  By sending a number
of requests to the servers from which the Great Cannon was directing
traffic, the researchers were able to piece together how it behaved and gain
insight into its inner workings. The cannon could also be used for other
malware attacks besides denial-of-service attacks. It was a powerful new
tool: ``Deploying the Great Cannon is a major shift in tactics, and has a
highly visible impact,'' Weaver and his coauthors wrote... Weaver found
something new and worrisome when he examined the attack. In a paper
coauthored https://citizenlab.ca/2015/04/chinas-great-cannon/
with researchers at Citizen Lab, an activist and research group at the
University of Toronto, Weaver described a new Chinese cyberweapon that he
dubbed the `Great Cannon'.  The Great Firewall -- an elaborate scheme of
interrelated technologies for censoring Internet content coming from outside
China -- was already well-known.  Weaver and the Citizen Lab researchers
found that not only was China blocking bits and bytes of data that were
trying to make their way into China, but it was also channeling the flow of
data out of China. [...]

  (Goldberg, RISKS-31.02)

"An Apple iOS remote jailbreak that can be achieved with no clicks required
by the end user while maintaining persistence on the device, even after it
is rebooted" implies a sinister payload.

The rising zero-day price tag is apparently a good thing, no? Perhaps
indicating that all the low-hanging, zero-day fruit have been harvested?

Or, is it the case that the specific zero-day end-point breach path is so
desirous that the purchaser will shell for exploit proof?

Must be a high-priority target to specify a particular exploitation
path. Apparently because it would be difficult to trace, detect or identify
via a device's anti-virus or malware sniffing stack?

Uncertain what constitutes "high-priority" in this case, unless Apple is
expressing exploit curiosity existence, or investigations have reached an
exploratory impasse.

As a BS guess to achieve this exploit:

Using either IMEI/MAC identifiers, or a target telephone number, a live
device's network stack (TCP/IP or telecom signaling system) would probably
have to initiate an exec(2) or invoke a signal handler to load a sibling
payload from a known buffer address that's been force-fed into and written
to the file system. How to achieve this without invoking a dynamic link
loader is a mystery to me. This file then can be reloaded/initiated through
some follow up protocol signal to effectively su(1) on the smellphone.
