Subject: Canadian network outage misunderstatement OTD (The Guardian)

One of Canada's largest phone/data carriers is still experiencing a major
outage today.  As reported in The Guardian:

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/08/internet-down-canada-rogers-mobile-network-outage

But what's stunning in the piece is this statement:

  "Interac, which operates an email money transfer service used by several
  Canadian banks, said the outage was affecting its services.
  Toronto-Dominion Bank said it was facing system issues with Interac
  e-Transfer service."

In reality, Interac isn't just some obscure interbank service; it's the
debit payment system used by millions of Canadians -- only some of which are
Rogers customers -- in millions of end-user transactions every day, through
every bank in the land, and it is DOWN.  Are the people running the Interac
network actually so clueless as to not have multihomed it via at least one
other major network?  Apparently so.

We hope that meaningful postmortems will follow.

Subject: OpenSSL Security Advisory, 5 July 2022 (OpenSSL)

Heap memory corruption with RSA private key operation (CVE-2022-2274)

Severity: High

The OpenSSL 3.0.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSA implementation
for X86_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions.  This issue makes
the RSA implementation with 2048 bit private keys incorrect on such machines
and memory corruption will happen during the computation. As a consequence
of the memory corruption an attacker may be able to trigger a remote code
execution on the machine performing the computation.

SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys running on
machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86_64 architecture are
affected by this issue.

Note that on a vulnerable machine, proper testing of OpenSSL would fail and
should be noticed before deployment.

Users of the OpenSSL 3.0.4 version should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.5.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected by this issue.

This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 22nd June 2022 by Xi Ruoyao. The
fix was developed by Xi Ruoyao.

Subject: Japan to start jailing people for online insults (KyodoNews)

*The new law goes into effect Thursday*EXCERPT:

Posting *online insults* will be punishable by up to a year in prison time
in Japan starting Thursday, when a new law passed earlier this summer will
go into effect.
<https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2022/07/1590b983e681-japan-to-introduce-jail-time-tougher-penalties-for-online-insults.html>

People convicted of online insults can also be fined up to 300,000 yen
(just over $2,200). Previously, the punishment was fewer than 30 days in
prison and up to 10,000 yen ($75).

The law will be reexamined in three years to determine if it's impacting
freedom of expression -- a concern raised by critics of the bill. Proponents
said it was necessary to slow cyberbullying in the country.

But there aren't clear definitions of what counts as an insult, Seiho Cho, a
criminal lawyer in Japan, told CNN after the law passed. The law says an
insult means demeaning someone without a specific fact about them -- as
opposed to defamation, which it classifies as demeaning someone while
pointing to a specific fact about them.  ``At the moment, even if someone
calls the leader of Japan an idiot, then maybe under the revised law that
could be classed as an insult,'' [...]

Subject: Ransomware Switched Programming Languages From Go to Rust (ZDNet)

Liam Tung, *ZDNet*, 6 Jul 2022, via ACM TechNews, 8 July 2022

Microsoft security researchers have found new variants of Hive ransomware
that were originally written in the Go coding language have been rewritten
in Rust. The switch has been underway for a few months, as Hive's authors
appear to be copying tactics from BlackCat ransomware, also written in
Rust. Researchers at cyberintelligence firm Group-IB determined the Hive
gang had converted its Linux encryptor for targeting VMware ESXi servers to
Rust so security researchers would be less able to surveill its ransom
discussions with victims. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center blogged
that the transition also involves more complex file encryption.

Subject: Computer glitch at American Airlines leads to triple pay (CNN)

No explanation of what this glitch was -- sounds to me like a garden-variety
programming error, nothing more...

https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/business/american-airlines-pilots-triple-pay/index.html

American Airlines has agreed to pay its pilots triple their normal rate
after a computer scheduling glitch left thousands of flights with
understaffed cockpits.

The malfunction in the scheduling program occurred early Saturday morning
and allowed pilots to drop flights the airline was counting on them to fly
throughout the rest of this month in order to take time off. The number of
flights left without one or both required pilots quickly soared past the
12,000 mark, according to the Allied Pilots Association, the pilots union at
American, which employs roughly 13,000 APA members.  Although the triple pay
is a one-time windfall for American's pilots, the airline has also agreed to
permanent double-time pay for pilots who fly on peak days, which often fall
during holiday travel periods.

Subject: Humans are making it hard to listen for aliens ()

*Increasing demands for mobile services and wireless Internet have crowded
the radio spectrum, creating interference that can skew data and add noise
to scientific results.*

Dan Werthimer has spent more than four decades trying to eavesdrop on
aliens.

A pioneering researcher in the field of astronomy known as SETI, or the
search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
<https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/we-just-beamed-signal-space-aliens-was-bad-idea-ncna822446>,

Werthimer's work involves scanning the cosmos with huge, ground-based radio
telescopes to look for strange or unexplained signals that may have
originated from alien civilizations.

If it sounds a bit like looking for a needle in a haystack, that's because
it sort of is.

In recent years, however, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence has
become even more complicated. Increasing demands for mobile services and
wireless Internet have crowded the radio spectrum, creating interference
that can skew data and add "noise" to scientific results.

"Earth is just getting more and more polluted," said Werthimer, chief
technologist at the Berkeley SETI Research Center. "With some radio bands,
it's already impossible to do SETI because they're so full of television
transmitters, WiFI and cellphone bands."

As wireless technologies continue to grow, the problem will only get worse,
Werthimer said, potentially jeopardizing one of the key ways that scientists
have to search for intelligent life in the universe.

Werthimer was recently one of the authors of a pre-print study led by
Chinese researchers that identified a radio signal that several news outlets
mistakenly reported as having characteristics of an alien civilization. The
signal was actually found to have been radio interference, Werthimer
clarified.  [...]

Why a country known for blazing broadband and innovative devices remains
tethered to a browser abandoned by most of the world long ago.

Daisuke Wakabayashi and Jin Yu Young, *The New York Times*, 8 Jul 2022
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/business/korea-internet-explorer.html

SEOUL -- In South Korea, one of the world's most technologically advanced
countries, there are few limits to what can be done conveniently online --
except if you're using the wrong web browser.

On Google Chrome, you can't make business payments online as a corporate
customer of one of the country's largest foreign-owned banks. If you're
using Apple's Safari, you're unable to apply for artist funding through the
National Culture and Arts website. And if you're a proprietor of a child-
care facility, registering your organization with the Health and Welfare
Ministry's website is not possible on Mozilla's Firefox.

In all of these cases, Microsoft's Internet Explorer, or a similar
alternative, is the required browser.

When Microsoft shut down Internet Explorer, or IE, on June 15, the company
said it would start redirecting users to its newer Edge browser in the
coming months. The announcement inspired jokes and memes commemorating the
Internet of yesteryear. But in South Korea, IE is not some online artifact.
The defunct browser is still needed for a small number of critical banking
and government-related tasks that many people can’t live without.

South Korea's fealty to Internet Explorer, 27 years after its introduction
and now into its retirement, presents a heavy dose of irony: a country known
for blazing broadband and innovative devices is tethered to a buggy and
insecure piece of software abandoned by most of the world long ago.

Most South Korean websites work on every browser, including Google Chrome,
which takes up about 54 percent of the country's Internet usage. Internet
Explorer is less than 1 percent, according to Statcounter. And yet after the
announcement from Microsoft, there was a last-minute scramble among some
essential sites to prepare for life after IE.

The South Korean arm of the British bank Standard Chartered warned corporate
customers in May that they would need to start using the Edge browser in IE
mode to access Straight2Bank's Internet banking platform. Various Internet
banking platform. Variou Korean government websites told users that some
services would likely face disruptions if they did not switch to Edge.  [...]

Subject: Where's the herd immunity? Our research shows why Covid is still
 wreaking havoc (The Guardian)

... Living with the virus is proving much harder than the early vaccine
success suggested: this fight is far from over

Danny Altmann, *The Guardian*, 1 Jul 2022
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/01/herd-immunity-covid-virus-vaccine

We are all so very tired of Covid-19, and there are many other crises to
wrestle with. This pandemic has been going on since the beginning of 2020,
and a state of hypervigilance can only be maintained for so long. And yet,
"just live with it" looks self-evidently too thin a recipe and, currently,
not very workable or successful with the emergence of BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron
subvariants.

According to the latest numbers, released today, the UK added more than half
a million new Covid infections in the past week, and the estimated number of
people with Covid in total was somewhere between 3% and 4% of the population.

Many have been rather unwell and off work or school, with the associated
disruptions to education, healthcare and other vital services. These
infections will also inevitably add to the toll of long Covid cases.
According to ONS data, the supposedly "mild" waves of Omicron during 2022
have brought more than 619,000 new long Covid cases into the clinical
caseload, promising an enduring and miserable legacy from this latest phase.

L2 isn't between the earth and the sun.

On the other hand L1, which *is* between the earth and the sun, isn't useful
for exo-planet astronomy, mainly because transmissions to Earth are
overwhelmed by the brightness of the Sun, but also because Earth occupies
part of the desired field of view. (Of course, if you *wanted* a continuous
fully sun-lit view of Earth, L1 would be perfect.)

Moreover, both L1 and L2 are *unstable*, as a satellite at either location
requires ongoing station-keeping, by intermittent rocket firing.

Banks are not responsible because these transactions were not
unauthorized. Victims were fooled, but voluntarily performed authorized
transactions. No one expects their bank to refund them when they get talked
out of $20 on a street corner. This is exactly the same.

Never Zelle anyone you don't know personally, it's the same as handing them
