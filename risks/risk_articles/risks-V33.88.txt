Subject: False news spreads faster than the truth (Science)

*To stop the spread of false news, first we have to understand it.*

A new study published in *Science*
<http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6380/1146> finds that false news
online travels ``farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth.''
And the effect is more pronounced for false political news than for false
news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or
financial information.

Falsehoods are 70 percent more likely to be retweeted on Twitter than the
truth, researchers found. And false news reached 1,500 people about six
times faster than the truth.

The study, by Soroush Vosoughi and associate professor Deb Roy, both of the
MIT Media Lab, and MIT Sloan professor Sinan Aral, is the largest-ever
longitudinal study of the spread of false news online. It uses the term
*false news* instead of *fake news* because the latter ``has lost all
connection to the actual veracity of the information presented, rendering it
meaningless for use in academic classification,'' the authors write.

To track the spread of news, the researchers investigated all the true and
false news stories verified by six independent fact-checking organizations
that were distributed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. They studied
approximately 126,000 cascades -- defined as ``instances of a rumor
spreading pattern that exhibits an unbroken retweet chain with a common,
singular origin'' -- on Twitter about contested news stories tweeted by 3
million people more than 4.5 million times. Twitter provided access to data
and provided funding for the study.

The researchers removed Twitter bots before running their analysis.  They
then included the bots and ran the analysis again and found ``none of our
main conclusions changed.''

``This suggests that false news spreads farther, faster, deeper, and more
broadly than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread
it,'' the researchers wrote.

So what to do? In an interview
<http://mitsloanexperts.mit.edu/watch-now-the-truth-about-fake-news-with-sinan-aral-and-tim-oreilly/>
for the MIT Sloan Experts video series, Aral said possible solutions include
labeling fake news much as food is labeled, creating financial disincentives
such as reducing the flow of advertising dollars to accounts that spread
fake news, and using algorithms to find and dampen the effect of fake news.

Subject: RSA, Other Crypto Systems Vulnerable to Side-Channel Attack
 (Cliff Saran)

Cliff Saran, *Computer Weekly*, 3 Oct 2023, via ACM TechNews, 4 Oct 2023

Hubert Kario at open source solutions provider Red Hat found a flaw
dating from 1998 that enables a "padding mode" side-channel attack
targeting RSA encryption. The exploit cracks the Transport Layer
Security (TLS) protocol's confidentiality when used with RSA
encryption, and researchers in 2019 highlighted the continued
vulnerability of many Internet servers to tweaks of the original
attack. Kario said attackers can leverage the flaw to decrypt RSA
ciphertexts and forge signatures, and record sessions on a TLS server
that defaults to RSA encryption key exchanges for decryption later. He
also said hackers can apply the exploit to other interfaces that
automatically execute RSA decryption, including Secure/Multipurpose
Internet Mail Extensions, JavaScript Object Notation web tokens, and
hardware tokens. Said Kario," We have identified the vulnerability in
multiple implementations and confirmed fixes in a few of them but
believe that most cryptographic implementations are vulnerable in
practice."

23andMe User Data Stolen in Targeted Attack on Ashkenazi Jews

At least a million data points from 23andMe accounts appear to have been
exposed on BreachForums. While the scale of the campaign is unknown,
n23andMe says it's working to verify the data.

The genetic testing company 23andMe confirmed on Friday that data from a
subset of its users has been compromised. The company said its system were
not breached and that attackers gathered the data by guessing the login
credentials of a group of users and then scraping more people's information
from a feature known as DNA Relatives. Users opt into sharing their
information through DNA Relatives for others to see.

Hackers posted an initial data sample on the platform BreachForums earlier
this week, claiming that it contained 1 million data points exclusively
about Ashkenazi Jews. There also seem to be hundreds of thousands of users
of Chinese descent impacted by the leak. On Wednesday, the actor began
selling what it claims are 23andMe profiles for between $1 and $10 per
account, depending on the scale of the purchase. The data includes things
like a display name, sex, birth year, and some details about genetic
ancestry results.  [...]

Subject: Kia and Hyundai Blame TikTok and Instagram For Their Cars Getting
 Stolen (Vice)

Aaron Gordon,*Vice*, September 29, 2023

Kia and Hyundai say it is not their fault that their cars are being stolen
in an unprecedented theft surge made possible by the vehicles lacking a
basic anti-theft technology virtually every other car has, according to a
recent court filing. Instead, the companies point the finger at social media
companies, such as TikTok and Instagram, where instructions on how to steal
the cars have been widely shared an thieves show off their stolen cars.

The lawyers representing the two corporations—which are owned by the same
parent company—are not subtle about this argument. The filing—in which the
company is arguing a roughly $200 million class-action settlement ought to
be approved by the court—includes an entire section heading titled “Social
Media and Intervening Third-Party Criminals Caused An Unprecedented Increase
In Thefts.” The lawyers argue i section that because Kia and Hyundai
vehicles have “not been the subject of significant theft” before the Kia
Boys social media trend, social media and the people who steal the cars—and
not the car companies—are to blame for the thefts. This argument is
summarized in the section titled “Social Media Incited Unprecedented Rise In
Thefts.” The filing broadly reflects both the public communications strategy
Kia and Hyundai have used throughout this crisis and some of the national
news headlines that have covered the story,

Subject: Rooftop Solar ongoing maintenance issues

I'm a huge fan of rooftop solar, so the following recent article really
depressed me regarding rooftop solar's future.

The problems:

Alana Semuels, 26 Sep, 2023 8:42 AM EDT
Rooftop Solar Power Has a Dark Side
https://time.com/6317339/rooftop-solar-power-failure/

* Rooftop solar installs are *custom* installations, with large upfront
  costs

* Rooftop solar systems are complex, requiring 'vigilance' and maintenance

* 'truck rolls' are incredibly expensive, with too few technicians available

* The 'leasing business model' for rooftop solar is bankrupt, leaving home
  owners in the clutches of yet another monopolist PE 'rentier' (just like
  cable and the local monopoly electric company the homeowner wanted to
  avoid!

* Solar systems degrade over time (just ask NASA's Mars Rovers !)  * the 3G
  -> 4G/5G cellphone transition killed a lot of older rooftop installations

    This particular article doesn't mention it, but electric utility
    monopolies *hate* rooftop solar, so they spend all of their lobbying
    money trying to kill it!

 (NBC News)

https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/chinese-self-driving-car-testing-china-california-pony-ai-waymo-cruise-rcna102787

SAN FRANCISCO -- The race on American streets to develop self-driving cars
has attracted increasing scrutiny in recent months, but some competitors --
China-based tech startups -- have received little mainstream attention.

China-based companies have driven hundreds of thousands of test miles on
California's roads in recent years, according to California Department of
Motor Vehicles records. Of the 40 companies with licenses to try out
autonomous vehicles in California, 10 of them are firms based in China -- a
bigger share than any other foreign country (Germany, Israel and Japan
follow China, and each has two licensed companies in the state). The
China-linked companies operated 124 cars in the state and drove 438,379
miles in the most recently reported year, the 12 months ending Nov. 30,
2022, according to reports that they filed with state authorities.''  The
Chinese test cars haven't drawn much public attention because of the smaller
scale of their tests compared to their U.S. competitors, including Cruise
and Waymo, which operate fleets in major cities such as San Francisco and
Phoenix.

But scrutiny of Chinese autonomous vehicles is increasing among lawmakers,
as U.S.-China relations have deteriorated in recent years and as
self-driving car tech develops. Some members of Congress are pushing for a
crackdown on the Chinese car startups, raising concerns about competition,
data privacy and China's human rights record and echoing complaints about
other Chinese-controlled companies, such as TikTok. And the Biden
administration is expressing similar worries.

The fears about Chinese autonomous vehicles are theoretical and
wide-ranging: from concerns about what type of data Chinese tech companies
are collecting to how Beijing might use a fleet of robot cars in the
worst-case scenario of an armed conflict with the United States.  [...]

 (The New York Times)
The K5, described as a “fully autonomous” security robot, is part of a push
by the mayor for more law-enforcement technology, which has raised concerns
among privacy advocates.

Privacy rights advocates remain skeptical. In May, the Legal Aid Society
requested that the Police Department’s inspector general investigate the
department’s use of surveillance technology, contending that it violated the
Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology Act, a city law requiring the
department to publish details about how new technology is being used and the
data it collects.

Mr. Cahn said he was wary that the K5 might eventually employ facial
recognition technology.

“If the mayor thinks there aren't enough cameras in Times Square, then he’s
more out of touch than I realized,” Mr. Cahn said.

“It’s more surveillance theater,” he added. “This is a mayor who doubles
down on public relations stunts rather than public safety any chance he
gets.”

Major crime on the subways is down 4.5 percent, police officials said.

*Northwestern Now* (10/02/23), via ACM TechNews

A research team led by Northwestern University scientists created an
artificial intelligence (AI) capable of designing robots from scratch
almost immediately. The researchers prompted the algorithm to design a
robot from a block about the size of a bar of soap, which generated a
successful design in 26 seconds. Northwestern's Sam Kriegman said, "We
told the AI that we wanted a robot that could walk across land. Then
we simply pressed a button and presto!" The algorithm operates on a
lightweight personal computer; other AI systems often require
power-hungry supercomputers and huge datasets. The researchers
fabricated the robot from the AI's blueprint, validating its
real-world performance.

If you read the articles, you'll find plenty of blame to go around.
The bridge in question was a private one, not a public one. It had
been blocked but someone (vandals?) had removed the blocks.

The bridge had collapsed many years before and Google had been
notified, I think more than once, that the bridge was out but had not
updated the map.

So on the one hand, Google shouldn't have sent him to the bridge. On
the other, if he'd gotten there on his own, it's not clear he'd have
been able to tell it was out before it was too late.
