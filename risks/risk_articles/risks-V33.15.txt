Subject: SoCal man says car computer on his new Tesla froze, causing vehicle
 to be stuck at 83 mph on freeway (ABC7)

The owner of a new Tesla Model 3 was left in shock after the car's main
features allegedly froze while he was driving on the freeway.

Javier Rodriguez of Irvine spoke with Eyewitness News on Tuesday and said it
happened last Thursday while he was heading westbound on the 10 Freeway
through Cabazon.

He said the car was stuck going 83 mph and the main screen was frozen.

He said all of the buttons and switches - including turn signals and hazard
lights - were not working.

"I noticed that it started to get hot in the car and there started to be a
weird scent coming," recalled Rodriguez. "I was nervous that if I were to
brake a whole lot that I wouldn't be able to gain the speed again to keep up
with traffic and get around cars. I was nervous somebody was going to slam
into me."

Even though the accelerator wasn't responding, fortunately Rodriguez said
the brakes did work, but said that didn't make him any more comfortable when
he was trying to stop.  He was able to make it off the road, and a few
minutes later, the car rebooted. That's when everything seemed normal.

An officer with the California Highway Patrol helped Rodriguez get off the
freeway, where he eventually had the car towed.  He said Tesla later told
him they fixed the vehicle, but all they would say about what happened was
what he said they wrote in the report.

"Diagnosed and found poor communication from charge port door causing power
conversion system to shut off in order to protect on board components
during drive," Rodriguez recalled. [...]

Subject: Driverless Cars Can Be Tricked into Seeing Red Traffic Lights
 as Green (New Scientist)

Matthew Sparkes, *New Scientist*, 16 Apr 2022
via ACM TechNews; Monday, April 18, 2022

Researchers at China's Zhejiang University found driverless cars could be
fooled into seeing red traffic lights as green. The scientists directed a
laser at the sensors of five camera models used by self-driving vehicles,
with two open-source software packages reading the captured images. Lasers
of a 650-nanometer and a 520-nanometer wavelength rendered the entire image
red or green, respectively, while flickering the laser at high frequencies
only induced this coloration in certain image segments. Adding a horizontal
bar of green or red caused both software packages to incorrectly sense the
traffic lights as green 30% of the time and red 86% of the time, on average,
across the cameras.

Subject: Risks of locust swarms

Vast swarms of locusts have decimated crops and grasslands across southern
Namibia in recent weeks and contributed to a deadly traffic accident.  A
minibus driver lost control on a slippery stretch of highway where the
ravenous pests were keeping warm on the pavement at night. Three of the 17
passengers died, with several more sustaining injuries. Officials say the
slime from locusts crushed by traffic caused the accident.

Please add just one more corner case in your automated-vehicle threat model.

Subject: What Can Hackers Do With Stolen Source Code? (WiReD)

Lapsus$ hackers leaked Microsoft's Bing and Cortana source code. How bad is
that, really?

The Lapsus$ digital extortion group is the latest to mount a high-profile
data-stealing rampage against major tech companies. And among other things,
the group is known for grabbing and leaking source code at every
opportunity, including from Samsung, Qualcomm, and Nvidia.  At the end of
March, alongside revelations that they had breached an Okta subprocessor,
the hackers also dropped a trove of data containing portions of the source
code for Microsoft's Bing, Bing Maps, and its Cortana virtual
assistant. Sounds bad, right?

Businesses, governments, and other institutions have been plagued by
ransomware attacks, business email compromise, and an array other breaches
in recent years. Researchers say, though, that while source code leaks may
seem catastrophic, and certainly aren't good, they typically aren't the
worst-case scenario of a criminal data breach.

``Some source code does represent trade secrets, some parts of source code
may make it easier for people to abuse systems, but accounts and user data
are typically the biggest things companies have to protect'' says Shane
Huntley, director of Google's Threat Analysis Group. ``For a vulnerability
hunter, it makes certain things easier, allowing them to skip a lot of
steps. But it's not magic. Just because someone can see the source code
doesn't mean they'll be able to exploit it right then.''

In other words, when attackers gain access to source codeâ€”and especially
when they leak it for all to see, a company's intellectual property could be
exposed in the process, and attackers may be able to spot vulnerabilities in
their systems more quickly. But source code alone isn't a road map to find
exploitable bugs. Attackers can't take over Cortana from Microsoft or access
users' accounts simply because they have some of the source code for the
platform. In fact, as open source software shows, it's possible for source
code to be publicly available without making the software it underpins less
secure.

Best comment somewhere was that news of Bing source compromised resulted in
4x increase in searches, "What is Bing?".

Subject: Feds Uncover a Swiss Army Knife for Hacking Industrial Control
 Systems (WiReD)

Andy Greenberg, WiReD, 13 Apr 2022
https://www.wired.com/story/pipedream-ics-malware/

  On Wednesday, the Department of Energy, the Cybersecurity and
  Infrastructure Security Agency, the NSA, and the FBI jointly released an
  advisory about a new hacker toolset potentially capable of meddling with a
  wide range of industrial control system equipment. More than any previous
  industrial control system hacking toolkit, the malware contains an array
  of components designed to disrupt or take control of the functioning of
  devices, including programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that are sold by
  Schneider Electric and OMRON and are designed to serve as the interface
  between traditional computers and the actuators and sensors in industrial
  environments. Another component of the malware is designed to target Open
  Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) servers -- the
  computers that communicate with those controllers.

  "This is the most expansive industrial control system attack tool that
  anyone has ever documented," says Sergio Caltagirone, the vice president
  of threat intelligence at industrial-focused cybersecurity firm Dragos,
  which contributed research to the advisory and published its own report
  about the malware. Researchers at Mandiant, Palo Alto Networks, Microsoft,
  and Schneider Electric also contributed to the advisory. â€œItâ€™s like a
  Swiss Army knife with a huge number of pieces to it."

Subject: Google Bans Apps With Hidden Data-Harvesting Software (WSJ)

Byron Tau and Robert McMillan, *The Wall Street Journal*, 6 Apr 2022,
via ACM TechNews, Wednesday, April 13, 2022

Google has pulled dozens of applications from its Google Play store amid
researchers' findings that they contain software that secretly harvests
data. Serge Egelman at the University of California, Berkeley and Joel
Reardon of Canada's University of Calgary found links between the code's
developer, Panama-based Measurement Systems, and a Virginia defense
contractor that conducts cyberintelligence and other work for U.S. national
security agencies. They learned the code ran on millions of Android devices
and could be found within a number of consumer apps. The researchers said
Measurement Systems had paid developers to embed its data-harvesting
software development kit into their apps, which "continues to underscore the
importance of not accepting candy from strangers," according to Egelman.

Subject: The Uncanny Future of Romance With Robots Is Already Here (Yahoo!)

In the late 2000s, a lifestyle reporter in Moscow named Eugenia Kuyda, then
in her early twenties, decided to produce a cover story on Roman Mazurenko,
the person at the center of Moscow's creative hipster scene at the time.
Right from the start, Eugenia and Roman both felt they had a profound
connection, and soon became close friends.

A few years later, Kuyda moved to San Francisco to start a chatbot-based
virtual assistant company. Shortly after, Mazurenko also moved and began
his American life. They kept in touch continuously and exchanged endless
text messages. But in late 2015 Mazurenko, then 34, was hit and killed by a
car while crossing a street during a short visit in Moscow.

Grieving Mazurenko, Kuyda read their messages over and over again. At some
point, she realized that these messages had the potential to be more than
just a memory. She took all the data she had and, with her team and using
Google-based neural networks, built a chatbot version of Mazurenko. The
result was surprisingly human-like. She could text with the chatbot on past
and future events, and digital Mazurenko came to life and felt real.
Digital Mazurenko was sad when she told him how much she missed him and
joyful when she shared with him her recent achievements at her company.

Kuyda and her team took this concept further and made a version that anyone
could use. They named it Replika and users loved it instantly. Looking back
at Replikaâ€™s success, Kuyda recounted, ``People started sending us emails
asking us to build a bot for them.''

Some people wanted to build a replica of themselves, and some wanted to
build a bot for a person that they loved but was gone.  These positive
reactions encouraged Kuyda and her team to go furtherâ€”to create fictitious
characters that accompany people around the world. Replika is now a
companion chatbot app available on almost any operating system with the
slogan: ``Always here to listen and talk. Always on your side.''  Millions
have downloaded the app, and it boasts hundreds of thousands of reviews,
most highly positive.  [...]

Subject: In Race to Build Quantum Computing Hardware, Silicon Begins

Tom Garlinghouse, Princeton University Department of Physics, 6 Apr 2022

Princeton University researchers achieved more than 99.8% fidelity using a
two-qubit quantum device made from silicon. The researchers used a double
quantum dot silicon device to capture and force two electrons to interact;
the entangling operation achieved the highest fidelity achieved so far for a
two-qubit gate in a semiconductor. Princeton's Jason Petta said, "This is
the first demonstration of a semiconductor spin qubit system where we have
integrated performance of the entire system--the state preparation, the
readout, the single qubit control, the two-qubit control--all with
performance metrics that exceed the threshold you need to make a
larger-scale system work."

One of my neighbors who has recently experienced long AT&T home Internet

the house that is being remediated, with a different truck each day --
apparently with no carryover from one customer to another or oone day to the

  ``He told me he didn't even have a way to be aware of it, and he couldn't
  look it up anywhere. He said he could see only the call for my particular

Honda may be assuming too much from a study on a few lab rats.  Different
species react to capsaicin very differently, as I found inadvertently.

I've had pet rabbits for many years.  Once, when we were fostering a litter
of young (~3 week old) abandoned bunnies, they jumped onto a kitchen table
(they're like deer; you need a *really* tall fence to keep them out...) and
ate a paper bag full of Thai Dragon peppers I was drying.  It was my entire
harvest for the year -- several dozen peppers, stems, seeds, and all.  Also
the paper bag, most of a pillar candle, half a bunch of bananas, with skins,
and part of a lead candle holder.

They weren't phased in the slightest by the capsaicin, though the peppers
were far too hot for me in any quantity.

I don't know how squirrels or other wire-destroying animals might handle
capsaicin, but if I were a company looking at solutions, I would make sure I
had a study of the particular animals of interest, and not try to generalize
from a lab-rat study.
