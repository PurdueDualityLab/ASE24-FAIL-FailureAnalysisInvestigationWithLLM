A pedestrian injured in a traffic collision in San Francisco died; EMTs

police car not prevented the ambulance from leaving promptly.

Subject: Ryanair boss calls air traffic chaos report rubbish (BBC News)

How did airport chaos unfold?

In its initial report published on Wednesday, Nats said that at 08:32 on 28
August, its system received details of a flight which was due to cross UK
airspace later that day.

Airlines submit every flight path to the national control centre; these
should automatically be shared with Nats controllers, who oversee UK
airspace.

The system detected that two markers along the planned route had the same
name - even though they were in different places. As a result, it could not
understand the UK portion of the flight plan.

This triggered the system to automatically stop working for safety reasons,
so that no incorrect information was passed to Nats' air-traffic
controllers. The backup system then did the same thing.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66723586

Fault tolerance? What's that? One bad flight plan craters the system?

Subject: Sourcegraph Administrator Access compromised by Credentials in
 Publicly Available Code (Ars Technica)

ArsTechnica reports that a recent security breach at Sourcegraph was
facilitated by credentials embedded in publicly-available source code.

Credentials visible in source or executable code is an obviously bad
practice. Besides the fact that it is obviously dangerous, it has been on
the OWASP list for many years.

The tragedy is that this class of security breach is completely
preventable. There is no reason for putting credentials in source or
executable code.

to decline. There are increasing reports of online AI voice generators being

Subject: Your car wants to know about your sex life

Cars are increasingly filming, recording and tracking drivers and
passengers, new report finds.

https://www.politico.eu/article/car-manufacturer-data-privacy-driver-passenger-sexual-activity-report/

Car manufacturers are collecting troves of data on drivers and passengers —-
some even tracking drivers' sexual activity -— according to a new report.

In a review
<https://linklock.titanhq.com/analyse?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffoundation.mozilla.org%2Fprivacynotincluded%2Fcategories%2Fcars%2F&data=eJxNTLsKwjAU_Zpks1RtAw4ZXArd1MU53sR4Nc0NeRT0603FoXDgcJ4gRde3AL2-iUO35VoGcpgRqDGFT_I6nDbi3LeXeRQ8yZeZ0bOuneiDzqk7Fa9VRvINRcujBEvlqaKulfVPkY-cQ2L7I9sNFavd_2nZ1yBEnBW8PWX04Io2upqgsrEU0aSfiAt9AYRVQBg%>
of 25 car brands and 15 car companies published by Mozilla Foundation on
Wednesday, researchers found that Japanese car manufacturer Nissan said it
could sell information about drivers and passengers’ sexual activity,
intelligence and health diagnosis to data brokers, law enforcement agencies
and other companies. German manufacturer Volkswagen said it could record
drivers’ voices to profile them for targeted ads.

“The amount of data that these car companies blatantly said that they could
collect was shocking,” said Jen Caltrider, lead researcher at Mozilla
Foundation, the nonprofit owner of the company running the Firefox
Browser. “It's like nobody's ever challenged them or asked them questions
about privacy, and so they just include everything.” [...]

Caltrider and other researchers looked at car companies’ privacy policies
and downloaded their apps in Germany, France, the U.S., Japan and South
Korea. They found that the industry hoovered up massive amounts of data
through dozens of sensors and technology built into newer car models that
calculate people's weight as they sit down, filmed the car inside and
outside with cameras, listened to conversations through microphones and
tracked users via connected apps on smartphones.

It's important to realize that even if you never watch over the air TV, many
people depend on it due to the unavailability of other options in their
locations, or due to cost issues. The broadcasting industry has been
making inane excuses for encryption of free channels, including (get this!)

Subject: Re: Kia and Hyundai Helped Enable a Crime Wave. They Should
 Pay for It (RISKS-33.82)

Increased car theft is happening in Canada, too. CBC reports many of them
are being shipped to overseas markets within days or even hours of being
stolen: https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/auto-theft-canada-1.6953242

"Police sources tell CBC News that large, established organized criminal
gangs based in Montreal are behind most of the thefts, though it's become so
lucrative, other groups with less technical skill are becoming
involved. This partially explains what the police sources say is an increase
in home invasions and violent attacks to obtain a vehicle and its
keys. ... Small teams sometimes mark cars in mall parking lots during the
day by using GPS trackers similar to the ones people can buy and place in
their luggage or on key chains to track lost items. Then, typically at
night, they use the trackers to follow the marked vehicles and take them
from streets and driveways, quickly cramming multiple vehicles into shipping
containers, which are then moved by truck or train to the Port of Montreal
and loaded onto ships.

"Most thieves use one of three methods of attack. The first type is a relay
attack, which involves "capturing" the signal of a key fob, then replicating
it to enter and start a vehicle. Thieves used to hold a large antenna in
front of a house door, scanning for keys left inside, but the technology has
advanced in the past year, becoming smaller and easier to use at a
distance. Then there is the onboard diagnostic port, accessible via a small
door under the steering wheel in all vehicles. Typically used by a mechanic
to connect a handheld computer that can diagnose a problem, the access point
is being used by thieves to reprogram the car to understand a new key
they've made for it. The latest attack method involves the Controller Area
Network (CAN bus), which acts similar to a nervous system for vehicles,
enabling communication between various components of the car. Thieves
connect to one of multiple nodes from the exterior of the vehicle,
commanding it to unlock and start the engine. The process may take only
seconds."

Subject: Re: Electric cars catch fire in Florida after flooding
 (RISKS-33.82)

I don't want to minimize the risk of EV's catching fire during/after
floods/accidents/recharging/shipping/aging/parking..., but let's
keep things in perspective.

It's taken well over 100 years to deal with gasoline-powered vehicles
exploding during/after refueling/accidents/shipping/parking...

Have a gander at newpapers and *movies* from 1920's, 1930's,
1940's, etc., to see how many of these problems there were, and
how long it took society to design gas tanks, filling stations,
tankers, etc., to minimize these risks.

https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-09-21-mn-832-story.html

Gasoline is perhaps the *worst* possible choice for a retail
fuel, due to its quick vaporization and subsequent tendency
to explode. Better choices would have been diesel and alcohol.

Indeed, some gasoline-powered racing cars were replaced
in 1965 by alcohol-powered racing cars due to the inherent risks
of gasoline.

https://www.motortrend.com/how-to/ctrp-1201-alcohol-fuel-basics/

>From the 20/20 perspective of hindsight, one can only marvel
at the politics and economics that enabled such an inherently
dangerous fuel like gasoline to become ubiquitous.

There is an inherent risk of *any* energy-storage mechanism
powerful enough to propel a 5000 lb vehicle 500 miles at 70 mph;
e.g., Lucid's new 113kwh battery:

https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a33797162/2021-lucid-air-517-mile-range-113-kw
h-battery/

Let's put this Lucid battery in perspective. A small fireplace might
generate perhaps 1.5 kwatts, so a Lucid battery fire might burn for
*three 24-hour days* with heat equivalent to a small fireplace.

The inherent risks of large quantities of energy storage were
already being explored in 1940's/1950's scifi -- e.g., the use of
short-circuited 'blaster' handguns as 'IED' bombs.

Definitely badly translated.  ChatGPT would never write in such a way. 
(Still wondering what the Figaro could be.)

The article recommends keeping your devices charged to no more than 30%
and/or not charging during flight.  With all due respect, that is not going
to happen unless you want to see a long line at the airport filled with
departing passengers looking for a phone recharging spot (which is almost
certainly going to be poisoned with malware anyway).

Abstract (aka tl:dr)

Life is unpredictable (so eat dessert first).  Our modern world is
unpredictable, and uncertain.  The increasing uncertainty drives fatalism,
which various political actors use to increase their own power and reduce
the possibility of opposition.  Information technology, based upon logical
computers, could provide more certainty.  Unfortunately, marketing
decisions frequently make the use of computers, and the results from
computers, more uncertain.  We, in information technology, should address
these issues, and work towards greater knowledge and certainty.
