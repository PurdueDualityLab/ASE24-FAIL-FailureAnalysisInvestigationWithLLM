Subject: Dutch government defers on dumbing down security (EDRi)

  [Source: EDRi, European Digital Rights (a confederation of digital-rights
  nongovernmental European organizations)]

Today the Dutch government sent their position paper on encryption to the
parliament: ``currently not appropriate to restrict development, availability,
and use of encryption.''

This may be relevant to many of you as some member states take a different
position on `the problem of encryption', the Dutch take a fairly clear
position and the Dutch hold the chair in the Council these six months. You
may even ask yourself whether it is coincidence the letter was sent only
today. :)

The government says:

  "The government's role is to ensure the safety of the Netherlands and the
  offenses to detect. The Cabinet stressed the need for legitimate access to
  data and communications. In addition, governments, businesses and citizens
  benefit from maximum security of the digital systems. The government
  recognizes the importance of strong encryption for Internet security, to
  support the protection of the privacy of citizens, for confidential
  communication of the government and companies, and for the Dutch economy."

  "Therefore, the government believes that it is currently not appropriate
  to adopt restrictive legal measures against the development, availability
  and use of encryption within the Netherlands. In the international
  context, the Netherlands will pronounce these conclusion and the
  considerations."

  G. A. Van der Steur H.G.J. Camp,
  Minister of Security and Justice,
  Minister for the Economy Business,

Subject: Bug in prison-release calculations unknown for 10 years, unfixed
  for 3 more

In 2012 the family of a crime victim in the state of Washington learned that
the criminal was going to be released earlier than he should have been.
They notified the state department of corrections (DOC), and it turned out
to be due to a software bug.

Specifically, if a prisoner in Washington receives time off their sentence
for good behavior, the amount of time off is supposed to depend on the
sentence as it would have been without the addition of "enhancements" based
on aggravating factors (such as using a firearm in the crime).  But since
2002, the actual computation has been based on the total sentence, including
any enhancements.

The DOC ordered a fix as soon as possible, but 3 years have now passed and
it still hasn't happened.  Now that this has come to public attention,
though, the fix is expected soon.

It is now estimated that since 2002 there have been 3,200 prisoners released
early, by an average of 55 days.

Subject: Kid Racks Up $5,900 Bill on Dad's iPad Playing Jurassic World

http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2497323,00.asp

  While said kid knew his dad's password to get onto the iPad itself, the
  dad was surprised to learn that his son had also memorized his Apple ID
  password. And, in doing so, he was able to bypass any restrictions his
  father had placed on the device and buy whatever he wanted in the game.
  The damage? The son made 65 transactions between December 13 and December
  18--that's a lot of dinosaurs--to the tune of L4,000, or just around
  $5,900.  Shugaa is apparently upset that Apple didn't do anything to
  verify that the many, many purchases made over that small time period were
  actually him.

I'm sorry, I consider these games to essentially be scams, and the companies
that take their cuts from the associated in-app revenues are at the very
least complicit in situations like this one. Busy parents cannot be expected
to monitor this stuff on top of everything else they have to do. The entire
in-app purchase ecosystem -- especially for games -- has turned into an
unethical mess.

https://www.onthewire.io/payment-card-protocols-wide-open-to-fraud/

  "This mechanism is protected by a cryptographic signature (MAC).  The
  symmetric signature key, however, is sometimes stored in Hardware Security
  Modules (HSMs), of which some are vulnerable to a simple timing attack,
  which discloses valid signatures. A signature extracted from one such HSM
  can be used to attack other, more secure models since the signature key is
  the same across many terminals, violating a base principle of security
  design," the researchers from Security Research Labs wrote in an
  explanation of the research, which was presented at the 32C3 conference in
  Berlin earlier this week.

Subject: IRS insider crime (Tax Law Prof Blog)

The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is 5+ years behind in applying
cyber-security repairs, according to US Government Accountability Office
(GAO), most recently because Republican Congress has dramatically cut IRS
funding beyond their core function, as punishment for scandal involving IRS
alleged mistreatment of conservative non-profits exploiting loopholes
created by US Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United.  The regulations for
non-profits needed to be totally re-written, because of that, but Congress
has not supplied sufficient funding for that to be done.  This has become a
cause celebre for Republicans in election campaigns.

* The last couple years, have had 1 million more tax payers, per year,
victimized by id theft which files fraudulent tax returns to get fraudulent
tax refunds sent to the crooks, then when the legitimate tax payer files
correct return, the IRS treats the victim as the crook.  Everyone expects
this volume to rise in the years ahead.

* Now we find that an IRS employee, whose job it was to assist taxpayer
victims of id fraud, had been conducting at least a $ million of that id
fraud.

http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2015/12/irs-employee-whose-job-was-assisting-victims-of-identity-theft-charged-in-1-million-identity-theft-t.html

* Nakeisha Hall obtained individuals' names, birth dates and Social Security
numbers through unauthorized access to IRS computers. Hall used the personal
identity information (PII) to prepare fraudulent income tax returns and
submitted them electronically to the IRS. Hall requested that the IRS pay
the refunds onto debit cards and directed that the cards be mailed to drop
addresses that she controlled. Hall solicited and received drop addresses
from Goodman, Coleman and other co-conspirators, who also collected the
refund cards from the mail.

* Hall activated the cards by using stolen identity information. She,
Goodman, Coleman and other co-conspirators took the money off the debit
cards at ATMs or used the cards for purchases. If the fraudulent returns
generated U.S. Treasury checks rather than the requested debit cards, Hall
and her co-conspirators used fraudulent endorsements in order to cash the
checks.  Hall compensated Goodman, Coleman and other co-conspirators by
giving them a portion of the refund money, or by giving them refund cards
for their own use.

The IRS is an agency in the US Dept of the Treasury, with an Inspector
General's office just for investigations of the IRS, with an endless parade
of reports on various different alleged wrong doing.

Subject: Risks of Facial Recognition (Consumer Reports)

Feb 2016 www.ConsumerReports.org has an article on who's tracking us in
public, how they doing it, and what are they doing with the info.  As
shoppers enter store, bank, mall, wherever, facial recognition identifies
who you are [1] - new customer, old customer, suspected crook (suspected shop
lifter, celebrity stalker, etc.), etc.  Customer Service greets you by name,
knows what kind of business you have done there before.

Facial Recognition is unregulated.  Companies may do anything they please
with your picture.  There is no ethical code of conduct.  They assume that
by you walking into their establishment, you give your permission for them
to do anything with your picture, without even giving you an opt-out
opportunity [2].  Churches use it to identify what regular attendee has
stopped coming, so they call to see if they are Ok.   Companies can use this
to target you with ads, some based on age & gender.  They do not have to
encrypt the data or protect it from breaches.  Hackers can sell the data to
kidnappers and stalkers.

[1] Google had a public relations disaster when the software identified two
    black people as gorillas.

[2] Facebook is being sued for using photo of someone without that person's
    consent.

Subject: "Tim Peake said a spreadsheet error had caused his prank call
  from space" (Sarah Knapton)

Sarah Knapton, *The Telegraph*

It was reported that Tim Peake attempted to make a telephone call to his
parents from the International Space Station, but dialed a wrong number...
:o)

  British astronaut Tim Peake blamed a spreadsheet error for wrongly phoning
  grandmother Betty Barker from the International Space Station.  Major
  Peake said Microsoft Excel had rounded up a number in his list, forcing
  him to accidentally dial a different West Sussex address when he tried to
  call his own family.  Mrs Barker hung up after hearing a strange man's
  voice say: ``Hello, Is this planet Earth?'' on Christmas Eve.  "There was
  a bit of a gap before he spoke - I thought it was one of those silent
  calls we are always getting."

  We already know hoverboards can catch fire. But this new video of an
  incident in Los Angeles brings it home. It was the first known hoverboard
  explosion in the city, the L.A. Fire Department told the Los Angeles

Subject: Cisco joins Juniper in thorough checking (Bank Info Sec)

Juniper found the unauthorized code, via an internal audit.  This implies
some kind of intruder, into Juniper, put it there.

So Cisco is conducting a similar audit, of their systems.

Are other outfits going to take similar steps?

Bottom line:

The computer software has two different modes, one of which is far more
efficient in its use of the additive Adblue (urea); the less efficient model
is selected only when running the standardized test.

It is not that easy.  I have received E-mails that are plausible as being
something I asked for and forgot about.  This would also be a way to sneak
spam, but it might be that I forgot about signing up.  If I can not remember
asking for it, I toss it.  I can see where the people who flag as spam are
coming from.

I had an interesting experience several years ago.  I used to have the
E-mail address <genew@qmail.ocis.net>.  I moved out of that ISP's area.
Twenty months later, I came back to the area.  I signed up with the same
ISP.  My E-mail address was then <genew@ocis.net>.  For whatever reason, the
ISP had dropped the "qmail.".  However, E-mail addresses with "qmail." got
routed to the address without it.  Shortly after, I started getting E-mails
from on-line mags that I had previously subscribed to.  Apparently, they did
not notice over a year's worth of bounce messages and continued sending.

There are also risks here.  What it had been someone else who had gotten
that E-mail address?  1) The person gets mailbombed.  2) There might be
enough identifiable information to cause trouble in some cases.

There are lead times for people writing articles for magazines, such that
what they write may have been a few months prior to when article published.
Not everyone can read every article on changes attempted.
