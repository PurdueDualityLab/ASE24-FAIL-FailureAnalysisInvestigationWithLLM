Subject: U.S. Air Force To Test Single-Pilot C-130 Flight Crews
 (FLYING Magazine)o

USAF and Merlin Labs plan to flight test Lockheed Martinâs C-130J Hercules
with autonomous software as a co-pilot.

Can a Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) C-130J Hercules fly with just one pilot?
It' a scenario the U.S. Air Force is exploring through a new partnership
with Merlin Labs, a Boston-based autonomous flight company that's gearing up
to test autonomous operations in the Air Force' venerable cargo workhorse.

Under the collaboration, Merlin Labs will retrofit a C-130 with software and
technology that will slim down the number of onboard crew, from two pilots
to one. The C-130, built at Lockheed Martin's factory in Marietta, Georgia,
holds the record for the longest continuous production run of any military
aircraft, according to the manufacturer.  The Hercules first flew in 1954.

Subject: Nuclear Fusion Is Already Facing a Fuel Crisis (WiReD)

It doesn't even work yet, but nuclear fusion has encountered a shortage of
tritium, the key fuel source for the most prominent experimental reactors.

In the south of France, ITER is inching towards completion. When it's
finally fully switched on in 2035, the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor will be the largest device of its kind ever built, and
the flag-bearer for nuclear fusion.

Inside a donut-shaped reaction chamber called a tokamak, two types of
hydrogen, called deuterium and tritium, will be smashed together until they
fuse in a roiling plasma hotter than the surface of the sun, releasing
enough clean energy to power tens of thousands of homes -- a limitless
source of electricity lifted straight from science fiction.

Or at least, that's the plan. The problem -- the white elephant in the room
-- is that by the time ITER is ready, there might not be enough fuel left to
run it.

Like many of the most prominent experimental nuclear fusion reactors, ITER
relies on a steady supply of both deuterium and tritium for its experiments.
Deuterium can be extracted from seawater, but tritium—a radioactive isotope
of hydrogen—is incredibly rare.

Fighting Around Europe's Largest Power Plant Is 'Out of Control,' UN's Nuke
Chief WarnsRussia is using a Ukrainian power plant as a fortress to launch
attacks.

by Matthew Gault August 3, 2022, 3:13pm

The head of the UN's nuclear regulatory watchdog is warning the world that
Europe's largest nuclear power plant "is completely out of control," Rafael
Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), told the Associated Press about the risk in an interview.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is in Southeast Ukraine along the
Dnipro river.

The plant has been a central part of the war since Russia invaded Ukraine at
the end of February.

Russian troops besieged it in early March, firing artillery shells at it
before taking it over.

The firefight between Russian and Ukrainian soldiers was watched by 95,000
people online through the plant's live streamed CCTV cameras.

An administrative building caught fire during the fight but the plant didn't
melt down.

  [Earlier items on this in RISKS-33.06 and 33.13.  PGN]

Washington Metrorail Safety Commission says Metrorail routinely skipped
steps in restoring lethal electrical power to tracks in work zones.

WMSC determined the Power Desk assistant superintendent had skipped three
safety protocols when directing that power be restored to the College Park
Station work zone. In addition, the Power Desk controller restored power
even though they knew two safety confirmations had not been completed.

WMSC also investigated similar lapses in safety that occurred on April 3,
May 1, May 6 and May 14, across multiple departments.

"Fatigue modeling indicates that the Power Desk controller's performance
effectiveness on April 26 was impaired due to sleep debt, short sleep
duration and the circadian effects of night work," WMSC's report says.  "The
Power Desk Controller also told investigators that they have difficulty
sleeping."

Further investigation revealed that Metrorail was assigning 12-hours
shifts and not filling some shifts due to staffing shortages.

A former T-Mobile store owner has been found guilty of using stolen
credentials to hack into “hundreds of thousands of cellphones” in a
multiyear scheme that netted him roughly $25 million that he spent on cars:

  Argishti Khudaverdyan, 44, who owned an Eagle Rock retail outlet in Los
  Angeles, used several dishonest methods to acquire the credentials needed
  to unlock phones or bypass carrier blocks, enabling customers to change
  network providers before their contract ended.  He used phishing emails
  and social engineering, and tricked those working at the T-Mobile IT Help
  Desk into resetting employee passwords, allowing him access to the
  internal system.

  The scheme, which he ran from August 2014 to June 2019, also involved
  unlocking phones that had been reported lost or stolen, allowing them to
  be sold on the black market. [...]

 (Dan Goodin)

Dan Goodin, Ars Technica, 03 Aug 2022, via ACM TechNews, 5 Aug 2022

Researchers at security company Volexity have discovered malware dubbed
SHARPEXT that the North Korea-sponsored SharpTongue hacker gang is using to
read and download email and attachments from victims' Gmail and AOL
accounts. Volexity's Steven Adair said SHARPEXT installs an extension for
Chrome and Edge browsers "by way of spear phishing and social engineering
where the victim is fooled into opening a malicious document." Email
services cannot detect the extension, and since the browser will already
have been authenticated, the compromise cannot be simply identified and
neutralized. Volexity said SHARPEXT has been in use for "well over a year,"
allowing hackers to compile lists of email addresses to ignore, and to
monitor already compromised emails or attachments.

Subject  War Thunder fans leaked classified docs to get more  realistic
 tanks (WashPost)

Fans wanted a war game to be more real, so they leaked classified docs

Video games have long led to fights: controllers thrown, unsubstantiated
accusations of cheating, insults hurled at mothers and even dogs. But no one
has ever leaked classified documents related to national security in a
public forum to win an argument â until last year, twice. And then again
this year.

Beginning in 2021, players of "War Thunder," a popular, free-to-play
vehicular combat video game, have thrice posted classified documents related
to three tanks of British, French, and Chinese origin, in an online forum
dedicated to the game. The posting of the documents was reported first by UK
Defence Journal, which wrote that one poster, who uploaded the manual to a
British Challenger 2 tank, said he was motivated by a desire to get a "War
Thunder" developer to make the tank more accurate in the game. Another
poster, who claimed to be part of a French tank unit, uploaded a Leclerc S2
manual while engaged in an online debate about its turret rotation speed.
The motivations of the user who posted allegedly classified information
about Chinaâs DTC10-125 tank, and a piece of materiel, was not clear.

Adam Zewe, MIT News, 3 Aug 2022, via ACM TechNews, 5 Aug 2022

A multi-institutional team of researchers led by the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology's Iddo Drori utilized a neural network model to
solve university-level math problems in seconds. The researchers used
OpenAI's Codex model, which was pretrained on text and "fine-tuned" on
code, to learn how pieces of text and code relate to each other. The model
can render text questions into code, given a few question-code examples,
then run the code to solve the problem. The model also automatically
explains its solutions, and can produce new problems in university math
subjects which university students were unable to distinguish from
human-generated questions. "This work opens the field for people to start
solving harder and harder questions with machine learning," Drori said.

"The credit bureau said it had unintentionally sent faulty scores to lenders, resulting in higher interest rates and application denials for some consumers."

"*The Wall Street Journal* reported Tuesday that, as Equifax was
transitioning to a new technology system, it unintentionally provided
inaccurate credit scores on millions of U.S. consumers seeking various types
of credit. In a statement on its website, Equifax acknowledged that as many
as 300,000 people experienced a score shift of 25 points or more, enough to
swing a borrower's credit rating from good to fair, or fair to poor."

A glitch? It appears Equifax didn't apply UAT before go-live? Or did they
know about the credit score discrepancy -- should be evident in their
qualification test reports for pass/fail on "legacy v. go-forward"
comparator output of credit scores. Perhaps the governance team was too
eager to go-live because of schedule commitments and didn't bother to read
the test results?

Very tiresome to watch reruns of the consumer crash test dummy show.

Subject: Bitcoin mining in the crypto crash -- mining companies' creative
 accounting (Amy Castor)

Bitcoin mining is a highly lucrative business as long as the price of
bitcoin keeps going up â and as long as investors believe it will keep going
up.

When the price crashes â and the price of bitcoin has halved since the start
of the year â crypto miners face margin calls, they have to dump their
bitcoins, and reality comes knocking.

In this post, we outline some of the biggest problems facing North American
bitcoin miners:

* Miners are nothing like as profitable as they report to the public stock
  markets that they are.

* Miners don't want to sell their freshly mined bitcoins, as this is would
  risk crashing the price of bitcoin -- so instead, they borrow against the
  bitcoins, and against their rigs, too!

* This business model only works if number goes up forever.

* Number does go up forever.

Subject: Rats deserve equal presence with Squirrels in RISKS (T.M. Brown)

Engine Troubles?  Check for Rats.
T. M. Brown, *The New York Times*, 7 Aug 2022

This article begins by resuscitating an old tale from early 2021 of a
Prius in NYCity's DUMBO area downtown: "The check engine kept flashing
.. despite the car driving just fine.  They did a bunch of tests and
couldn't figure out what it was."  Finally they discovered a rat had
chewed through a sensor wire.  $700 bill.  The usual RISKS story of
trying to spread the blame to bad city planning, the pandemic, more
food trucks in residential areas, overcrowding, etc.

T.M. Brown's last paragraph is worth quoting:

  Two years ago, a looming fear among bureaucrats, business people, and
  undying loyalists to the city's complexities was that New York [City]
  would dangerously thin out, that enough people would make permanent their
  exodus to Connecticut or Duchess County to destroy an already precarious
  economic and social equilibrium.  Instead the new story is simply a replay
  of the old one -- a narrative of tensions among impassioned competing
  interests that all feel entitled to lay their personal claims to public
  space.  It's maddening, perhaps impossible in the end and yet deeply
  reassuring all at once.

Risks relevance?  Many things seem to be changing underfoot with the
pandemic, but in many ways the problems remain more of the same -- only
perhaps intensified.

Subject: Robotic Surgery (RISKS 33.36)

More complete reporting of the rates of robotic and manual surgery wouldn't
be sufficient to make the comparative risks much less challenging to
interpret.  The problem, as is always the case with nonrandomized medical
data, is selection bias.  The patients who undergo robotic procedures are
not necessarily similar to those who get manual procedures, the nurses who
attend them are not necessarily similar, and the surgeons are obviously
dissimilar, in ways that may be pertinent.  To make a reliable comparison of
the two techniques, one would need to do a randomized trial.

Randomized trials to make this sort of comparison are not new.  For example,
see British Journal of Surgery 92(1): 44-49 (2005).

The less easily solved problems, apparently raised in the IEEE article cited
by Stein, and raised earlier when laparoscopic abdominal surgery became
popular ~20 years ago, are those faced by trainees:

 * Learning how to do high-tech procedures is tricky, because trainees'
   participation in them is even more passive than it is during most open
   procedures.

 * Open procedures may be getting rarer and rarer, but sometimes they are
   needed.  Sometimes (possibly more in abdominal procedures than in
   prostate procedures; I don't know), procedures are begun as laparoscopic
   or robotic procedures but then the surgeon finds anatomic variants, old
   scars, or other surprises that force the surgeon to switch to an open
   procedure.  Nowadays a trainee surgeon may hardly ever have seen (let
   alone performed) a conventional open cholecystectomy.  This is not a
   solved problem.

"There is a lot of research showing that clinical decision support software
is generally beneficial. For instance, it reduces medication prescribing
errors and enhances the chance that doctors will follow guidelines for
delivering high-quality healthcare. Yet there is also increasing awareness
that malfunctions in clinical decision support software are more common than
we think."

The FDA's regulatory approach to CDS software functions are published here:
https://www.fda.gov/media/109618/download (retrieved on 05AUG2022).

The CDS must accurately determine if a prescription fits the condition, does
not interact with a patient's current medicine schedule, the patient is not
allergic to the new medicine, etc. If a dispenser fills the wrong medicine,
though the prescription order is correct, how can one blame the physician?
Physicians don't stock dispensers.

I tried to ferret out CDS software adverse device events from the FDA's TPLC
platform, but did not discover a huge trove of records. In fact, I could not
find ANY devices in the TPLC repository assigned to product codes by
searching for "clinical decision support".

I found a few devices assigned to the term "medication" and "dispenser":
Consult https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfTPLC/tplc.cfm

use TAI or UTC so long as you and your friends use the same one.  The UTC
adjustment means that at noon UTC in Greenwich, England, the sun will be
directly overhead, but since we all use time zones, for most of us the sun
has never been overhead at noon because we are not in the exact middle of
our zone.

Rather than moving the clocks forward or backward a second every few years,
just let the UTC clocks keep ticking, and let the astronomers take care of
themselves. (I gather they do that now, since astronomy needs way better
than one second resolution.)

Perhaps by 2200 the difference between TAI and UTC will be enough that
people care, so they will add a leap ten minutes, but by then we and our
grandchildren will be long gone.

I think you are missing the point.  I think people are unhappy not because
the feature requires a paid activation _once_, but because they don't like
the "subscription" model where they _pay per use_.

Imagine you have to pay your fridge maker every time you want to open the
fridge door.

Yes (your first four paragraphs).

But, that's price discrimination for selling identical products rather
than offering different products at different price points.

...which next two paragraphs discuss.

Regarding "[IBM] could have sold them all without the delay relay and not
gone broke" -- sure, but why should they? And at what price? Why is what
they did worse for the market than having two actually different devices,
vs. one device offering different benefits for different prices?

Why would it be better -- and unremarkable -- for BMW to have used two seat
models, vs. one model with different benefits at different price points?

Putting aside the objectionable rental model, why is charging more for
heated seats bad because it's implemented in software, vs. how it's been
done traditionally, with different seats?

My main objection is to charging subscription model for features, not to
having them software enabled. Features should be offered at one-time fair
prices. (And not absurdly bundled so you must buy more than wanted to get
what IS wanted).

BUT -- it might be nice to have the option -- if a feature isn't purchased
-- to be able to pay per use/week/month. Imagine you travel from warm
climate where you live to someplace bitter cold -- you didn't buy heated
seats but want them temporarily. Or you need the refrigerator light just
once to clean back of shelves. ;-)

 (RISKS-33.36)

It's worth reading the paper and not just the press release.

The study is well designed. They picked a representative set of Irish
supreme court cases, wrote articles about them, added half the articles to
Wikipedia, and indeed the cases they added got more citations and the
citations resembled the articles.

This does not mean that anything bad happened. Partly it's a statistical
question, since they didn't distinguish citations that used language from
the original cases, which should be OK, rather than from the summaries,
which might not be.

To create these articles, first they went through and selected important
cases, then they had law students write the summaries, which were overseen
and edited by law faculty. The summaries should have been good and the cases
were important -- why wouldn't you want a judge to use them?

Beyond that, Wikipedia has a process to remove articles about topics
that aren't sufficiently notable, but it is quite slow, and they'd
have to wait a long time to see whether their added articles stayed
or were deleted.

To test whether judges just used the articles without checking the
actual decisions, they'd have to add articles with deliberately wrong
summaries, or summarize fake cases, but that kind of human
experimentation has ethical issues.

If we are to believe the purveyors of school surveillance systems, K-12
schools will soon operate in a manner akin to some agglomeration of Minority
Report, Person of Interest, and Robocop. "Military grade" systems would
slurp up student data, picking up on the mere hint of harmful ideations, and
dispatch officers before the would-be perpetrators could carry out their
vile acts. In the unlikely event that someone were able to evade the
predictive systems, they would inevitably be stopped by next-generation
weapon-detection systems and biometric sensors that interpret the gait or
tone of a person, warning authorities of impending danger. The final layer
might be the most technologically advancedâsome form of drone or maybe even
a robot dog, which would be able to disarm, distract, or disable the
dangerous individual before any real damage is done. If we invest in these
systems, the line of thought goes, our children will finally be safe.

"How Bad Is My Batch" is clearly an anti-vaccine conspiracy site. While it
is entirely possible that different batches have different effectiveness and
even that some have more side effects (after all, that's why we keep track
of batches) this website suggests that some batches are *deliberately* made
"toxic". See https://www.howbadismybatch.com/allnothing.html.

A criticism of the web site pointing out more issues and also notes other
disturbing comments made by the person behind the web site can be found on
https://www.thedailybeast.com/craig-paardekoopers-shady-site-shows-covid-anti-vaxxers-will-believe-anything.

  [Lars-Henrik, I an NEITHER an anti-vaxxer NOR a conspiracy theorist.
  However, a criticism of your criticism is needed.  There is so much

  "clearly" is *clearly* a gross overstatement.  It has become almost
  impossible to get to the truth when every truth gets shot down as a

  vaccine.  If that was one of the clearly bad batches in the website data,
  then you are shooting yourself in the foot by condemning *everything* on
  the website.  I believe a conspiracy may be on the side of overhyping the
  effectiveness of the vaccines and hiding some negative results -- perhaps
  in false hopes of discouraging the anti-vaxxers.  PGN]

Subject: Book Review: America's Biggest Lottery Scam by Bob Sand

  [Reproduced with permission from another list.  PGN]

I just finished an interesting book, America's Biggest Lottery Scam by Bob
Sand.  The author was the lead prosecutor in uncovering the rigging of
lottery equipment from the Multistate Lottery Association (MUSL) by their
employee Eddie Tipton.  This is a textbook example of an insider threat at
work in an organization that had what looked like really good internal
controls to guard against such things.  When we talk about how difficult it
would be to rig voting machines, that is because of similar kind of internal
controls that might be vulnerable to similar insider threats.

The book is written as a narrative from the prosecutor's perspective, so
it's structured as a detective story.  Viewed from that perspective, the
story is interesting because the statute of limitation was running out as
the first lottery rigging case reached the point where charges could
possibly be brought.  Furthermore, that case was not strong.  They get a
conviction halfway through the book, and that is where things start getting
interesting because only then did the scale of the lottery rigging become
apparent, and only then did the technical detail s begin to come out.  The
book ends with the first case being as good as thrown out on appeal at about
the same time that Tipton agreed to a plea deal in the larger case that
included a complete confession, allowing the various state lotteries that
had been defrauded to tighten their own defenses.

The technical details of the lottery technology dribble out slowly over the
course of the book, but they are there.  As is the case with election
machinery, code for the sealed lottery computers was installed with
oversight from a third party testing organization that also examined the
source code.  There was room for sleight of hand, though, allowing Eddy
Tipton to install hacked code in lottery computers while turning over clean
code to the testing organization.  The hack?  On scattered but predictable
dates, the lottery computers would be less than random, with a set of
possible winning numbers small enough that you could buy a manageable stack
of tickets and have a good chance of winning.

Rigged lottery computers from MUSL ended up in Iowa, Wisconsin, Missouri,
Colorado, Ohio and possibly other states.  Tipton gave away winning lottery
tickets or notes on winning numbers to a number of friends and relatives.
Only two of the wins attracted investigations.  When his brother won the
Colorado lottery, he cashed the check and got a suitcase full of
consecutively numbered $100 bills.  That spooked him and he tried to launder
the money, attracting the FBI's attention.  They couldn't identify the
crime, but the case was weird enough that the age nt involved remembered it
and became involved when Sand began to dig.

Sand was brought in because a multi-million dollar winning ticket in Iowa
went unclaimed for most of a year, and then two credible attempts were made
to claim it, neither of which involved someone who resembled the ticket
purchaser --the law required the lottery ticket to be redeemed by the
person who purchased the ticket, and they had surveillance camera footage of
the purchaser who seemed very intent on not being recognized.

On the downside, the author spends several chapters on autobiography and
biography, talking about his upbringing and about Eddy Tipton, both who grew
up in small rural communities.  Sand is very interested in the psychology of
the crime, what would lead a bright programmer to rig the machines and then
use that rigging in a series of stolen jackpots, mostly benefiting others.
Sand also ends on an autobiographical note, describing how, after working as
an assistant attorney-general prosecuting white collar crime, he realized
that the job was changing him in ways he didn't like.  So he ran for state
auditor, a job he now holds.  That means that this book can be seen as
campaign literature as well as an interesting true computer crime story.
