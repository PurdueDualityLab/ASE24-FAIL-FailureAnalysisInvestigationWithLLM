Maui disinformation.
Covert campaign shows rapid shift in tactics against the West.

``The disaster was not natural, ... but was the result of a secret `weather
weapon' being tested by the United States,'' according to the Chinese
disinformation.  To bolster the plausibility, the posts carried photographs
that appeared to have been generated by artificial intelligence programs,
making them among the first to use these new tools to bolster the aura of
authenticity of a disinformation campaign.

  [This seems to reach into far-fetched territory that is indistinguishable
  from truth to those who believe their government.  It gave me just one
  more truth-ache.  (Somewhat ironically, I finally got around to reading
  the article at two-thirty!)  PGN]

Same basic story with online variant title:
 China Sows Disinformation About Hawaii Fires Using New Techniques

 David E. Sanger and Steven Lee Myers,
 *The New York Times*, 11 Sep 2023

Researchers at Microsoft, the University of Maryland, and other
organizations found China's government is utilizing new methods to
promulgate disinformation about last month's wildfires on Maui, claiming
they resulted from tests of a secret "weather weapon." Such content includes
photos apparently produced by artificial intelligence to add plausibility to
Beijing's false narrative. The campaign seems to indicate China has shifted
tactics from intensifying state propaganda to actively spreading discord in
the U.S. The researchers suggested China was amassing a network of accounts
that could be leveraged in future information (or disinformation) campaigns
for ``amplifying conspiracy theories that are not directly related to some
of their interests, like Taiwan,'' said Brian Liston at cybersecurity
company Recorded Future.  [...]

 Combat Ship Program (ProPublica)

Littoral combat ships were supposed to launch the Navy into the future.
Instead they broke down across the globe and many of their weapons never
worked. Now the Navy is getting rid of them. One is less than five years
old.

My grandmother, born late 1880's, told me ~1960 that she liked
horse-drawn dates when she was a teenager because "the horse
knew the way home".

Subject: Re: Pedestrian dies after Cruise cars block ambulance
 (RISKS-33.83)

A few observations:

> A pedestrian injured in a traffic collision in San Francisco died; EMTs
> allege that they would have survived had two Cruise cars and an unoccupied
> police car not prevented the ambulance from leaving promptly.

First: It helps to read the entire story and not just the headline:

  [. . .] Cruise spokesperson Tiffany Testo countered that one of the
  cars cleared the scene and that traffic to the right of it remained
  unblocked. "The ambulance behind the AV had a clear path to pass the
  AV as other vehicles, including another ambulance, proceeded to do,"
  she wrote in a statement to SFGATE.

Second: You will note that the injury to the pedestrian was apparently
driver `caused by a "driverful" automobile, but apparently nobody is raising
a stink over "'death traps' and a menace to disabled people and children[1]"
in vehicles driven by humans.  We just seem to accept that as a part of day
to day life.

Third: You will also note that there was a human-driven police vehicle also
blocking egress.  Perhaps we're seeing a little convenient blame-shifting by
the SFPD?
