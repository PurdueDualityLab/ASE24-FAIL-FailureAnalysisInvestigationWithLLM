Subject: AI Hiring Bias Spurs Scrutiny, Regulations (Bloomberg)

Erin Mulvaney, *Bloomberg Law*, 29 Dec 2021, via ACM TechNews, 10 Jan 2022

Artificial intelligence (AI)-related hiring discrimination has prompted
regulatory action, with New York City banning employers from using automated
employment decision tools for screening job applicants in lieu of a bias
audit. Meanwhile, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine has
announced proposed legislation to address algorithmic discrimination by
mandating annual corporate technology audits. The U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission's Charlotte Burrows said up to 83% of employers, and
as many as 90% of Fortune 500 companies, use automated tools to screen or
rank job candidates; she warned these technologies "could be used to mask or
even perpetuate existing discrimination and create new discriminatory
barriers to jobs."  Civil rights groups like the Surveillance Technology
Oversight Project (STOP) worry that New York's measure could enable more AI
bias, and have proposed banning biased technology altogether.

Allison Murray, *ZDNet*, 20 Jan 2022, via ACM TechNews, 21 Jan 2022

Medical cybersecurity platform Cynerio's 2022 State of Healthcare IoT Device
Security Report estimates 53% of connected medical devices in hospitals have
critical flaws, including a third of bedside devices. Cynerio analyzed more
than 10 million medical devices at over 300 global hospitals and medical
facilities and found, among other things, that 73% of infusion pumps,
constituting 38% of hospital Internet of Things (IoT) inventory, possess
some type of vulnerability. Cynerio warns hacked medical devices would
affect hospital service availability, data confidentiality, and patient
safety. Said Cynerio's Daniel Brodie, "Hospitals and health systems don't
need more data--they need advanced solutions that mitigate risks and empower
them to fight back against cyberattacks, and as medical device security 
 it's time for all of us to step up."

The Twist programming language created by researchers in the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory is designed to codify quantum computing. Twist can characterize
and verify which pieces of data are entangled in a quantum algorithm, and
applies the concept of purity, which enforces the absence of quantum
entanglement, to produce intuitive programs with fewer flaws. MIT's Charles
Yuan said, "Because understanding quantum programs requires understanding
entanglement, we hope that Twist paves the way to languages that make the
unique challenges of quantum computing more accessible to programmers."

Subject: My 2020 app

The 2020 Olympics are coming up.  I have more reason than normal to ignore
them this year, but I noted a news story about the "My 2020" app, and its
security problems.

All athletes, coaches, officials, and the vanishingly small number of
"guests" that are allowed at this year's Olympics, are to use the "My 2020"
app, which is provided by China.  It seems to provide information and
schedules, but it also collects detailed information about all attendees,
including CoVID test status (on a very regular basis).  The thing is, it's
insecure.

As most such apps do, it connects to a central server to collect and dump
data.  Most apps do a bit of verification of that server.  My 2020 does
not.  So, of course, it would be relatively trivial to set up a fake
server, collect all kinds of data and personal information (for example,
loads of names, birthdates, and passport numbers, as well as the
aforementioned CoVID results), and give out misinformation or
Disinformation about schedules, events, locations, and generally mess with
the games.

I think I'll have a heart attack and die from *NOT* being surprised that
the Chinese government failed to take this simple security precaution.

You have to understand that there is a difference in mindset.  Here in "the
West" (being from BC, I tend to think of myself as being from the far, far
east), the computer security field started with an interest in
confidentiality.  It was only later that we, in information security,
expanded our interest to include integrity and availability.  But the
Chinese government has never been interested in confidentiality and privacy.
(At least, not for their citizens.)  The Chinese government always wants to
know everything there is to know about anyone in China.  (Or anyone outside
of China, for that matter.)  Privacy is a non-issue.  (To the government.)
This is why encryption is almost unheard of in China.  Even most government
and military personnel and officials (with the exception of a very, very
few) do not have their communications protected by encryption.  (Other
governments therefore find it trivially easy to snoop on the bulk of
military and government communications traffic in China.)

So, since the government of China is primarily interested in availability
(of the opportunity to snoop on visitors), the lack of server authentication
is unsurprising.  It may not have occurred to anyone that it might be a
problem.  It may even be a design feature, from the Chinese perspective,
rather than a flaw.  After all, if anyone can set up a fake server, collect
information, and provide disinformation, so can the Chinese government.
With impunity and total deniability.

Re: Boeing and Airbus warn US over 5 G safety concerns (bbc.com)

This is a long running fight between the FAA and FCC.  Neither side has
covered itself in glory but the FAA has been a lot worse.

For 15 years we have known that old cruddy radio altimeters are subject to
interference from adjacent bands including the new 5G C-band.  The sensible
approach would have been for the FAA and FCC to work together on a
combination of finding and replacing the old altimeters perhaps with
subsidies from the telcos, and power limits on C-band cells near runways.
Instead we get dueling press releases.

Forty other countries have worked this out with the same altimeters and same
5G band.  What do they know that we don't?

Following on from the risk highlighted after Christmas (RISKS-33.01), it now
appears that the airline / mobile ( cellular) operator deal was only a
temporary halt.

The risk still remains -- in the U.S. the frequencies used by 5G overlap
with those used by critical safety devices fitted to aircraft. Aircraft
systems are built to an international standard and hence can't be changed.

https://techxplore.com/news/2022-01-faa-boeing-5g.html

Federal safety officials are directing operators of some Boeing planes to
adopt extra procedures when landing on wet or snowy runways near impending
5G service because, they say, interference from the wireless networks could
mean that the planes need more room to land.

The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday that interference could
delay systems like thrust reversers on Boeing 787s from kicking in, leaving
only the brakes to slow the plane.

That 'could prevent an aircraft from stopping on the runway,' the FAA said."

Key Findings

The Citizen Lab and Access Now have conducted a joint investigation into
Pegasus hacking in El Salvador in collaboration with Frontline Defenders,
SocialTIC, and Fundación Acceso.

We confirmed 35 cases of journalists and members of civil society whose
phones were successfully infected with NSOâs Pegasus spyware between July
2020 and November 2021. We shared a sample of forensic data with Amnesty
International's Security Lab which independently confirms the findings.

Targets included journalists at El Faro, GatoEncerrado, La Prensa Gráfica,
Revista Digital Disruptiva, Diario El Mundo, El Diario de Hoy, and two
independent journalists. Civil society targets included Fundación DTJ,
Cristosal, and another NGO.

Subject: Re: Fake QR Codes on Parking Meters (RISKS-33.02)

I warned about this class of attacks a few months back (RISKS 32.93).
Although I must admit the attackers took the next step.  I was concerned
about attackers replacing legitimate QR codes (e.g., on menus) with their
own versions.  In this attack, however, Austin doesn't actually put QR codes
on meters."  The attackers just added their own.  People have no become so
accustomed to scanning QRcodes that they don't question even their presence.
This opens the attack surface wide.  How about a "scan for hours and menu"
QR code on the outside glass of a restaurant?  If they are closed on Monday,
how many passers-by will it catch if placed there early Monday morning --
with no one from the store even being present to notice until Tuesday?

Similar attacks work all over the place.  Any store window.  The doors of
cars on a dealer lot -- "Scan for our best price on this beauty!"  At the
entrance to a Mall: "Scan for a map."  Or at an office building: "Scan for a
tenant list."  The commuter rail lines around NY have an app that allows you
to pay for your ticket; you then show your phone to the conductor when he
checks for tickets.  For those who don't have the app ... imagine a QR code
that says "Beat the rush! Scan here to buy an eTicket."

The important thing to realize is that an "addition" attack -- unlike a
"replacement" attack -- leaves the owner of the physical object where the
code is presented entirely out of the loop.  A restaurant using QR codes for
menus, say, could in principle have a sign on the wall with a picture to be
matched to the presented menu.  It could change very day -- or, if presented
on a screen, every 10 minutes.  How effective this would be -- how often
people would actually look and compare -- is questionable, but it's at least
a way to provide some degree of authentication.  But what's Austin to do:
Post signs everywhere telling people "we don't use QR codes"?  How effective
is that likely to be.

We've spent decades (mainly unsuccessfully) teaching people not to click on
links in unsolicited emails.  QR codes are even worse.  Since they are
essentially * never* solicited in any meaningful sense ... "intent" is no
longer a meaningful distinction.  They are completely unparseable to human
beings. Even if a QR code reader showed the URL on the phone's screen with a
"click if this is OK" ... given that the whole purpose of the code is
provide a quick, frictionless interface, what are the odds people will read
the incomprehensible -- even the legitimate ones are not intended for human
comprehension - URL's that result?

QR codes.  Just say no.

Subject: Re: Metro says timing for return of suspended railcars is unknown
 (RISKS-33.01-02)

The mathematical relationship "more than" does not need further
interpretation. It is the measurement itself that needs interpreting.

If the displacement is measured at precisely 1/32 of an inch, then the
actual measurement is 1/32 of an inch plus or minus the error in the
reading. This error is very unlikely to be precisely zero. So the
probability of the actual measurement being *more than* 1/32 of an inch is
very close to 50%.

So the question is: should a car be taken out of service if there is close
to a 50% chance that it is out of spec?

Put this way, I think it is reasonable to err on the side of safety.

Subject: Re: Metro says timing for return of suspended railcars is unknown
 (RISKS-33.02)

To be fair, the technicians may well understand both the meaning of "More
than" and that small length measurements need to be specified as a function
of their environment.

The metro specification requires a measurement accuracy of at least
1/32 of an inch.  But steel expands approximately .07% per 100 degrees
F.  For a measurement of 53 5/16 of inches, a 100 degree difference
works out to be .037 inches > 1/32 inch.  Working backwards, an 85
degree F difference could result in a greater than 1/32 inch
expansion.

It seems to me that the real risk is in a specification of an absolute
length deviation without ALSO specifying the temperature at which the
measurement must be made.

FWIW: Coincidentally, Adam Savage (of Myth Busters) recently produced
a wonderful video (https://youtu.be/qE7dYhpI_bI) on why all
sufficiently precise measurements are a function of their environment.
Perhaps the technicians are Adam Savage fans.
