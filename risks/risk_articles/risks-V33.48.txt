Seattle-area patients frustrated by days of system outages at Virginia Mason
Franciscan Health facilities

   8 Oct 2022 at 4:55 pm Updated Oct. 9, 2022 at 1:24 pm

   Shaun D'Sylva was trying to get a handle on his stepfather's medical care
   this past week by logging in to MyChart, a patient portal used by medical
   providers for users to track appointments, test results, medications and
   other health records.

   The website wouldn't load.

  Hospital-wide system outages, stemming from an IT security issue reported
  by Virginia Mason Franciscan Health's parent company, have led to several
  days of disruptions for patients and providers at VMFH facilities
  throughout Puget Sound, with no estimated restoration date.  Along with
  outages of the MyChart system, appointments were canceled or rescheduled,
  some with no notice because schedulers couldn't look up patients' contact
  information in a database.

  CommonSpirit Health, the company affiliated with 10 VMFH hospitals
  throughout the Puget Sound region, said it has identified the security
  issue but hasn't provided additional details on who or what may have
  caused the issue.

  CommonSpirit Health has 140 hospitals in 21 states and was created in 2019
  when Catholic Health Initiatives and Dignity Health merged, according to
  its website. It's unclear how many facilities have been affected, though
  several have reported disruptions. In Iowa, ambulances were diverted from
  MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center's emergency department because of a
  system shutdown.

Subject: Russian hackers attack US airport Websites (NPR)

Killnet, a pro-Russian hacker group, called for hackers to mount a DDoS
(Distributed Denial of Service) attack against various American airport
Websites.  A number of them were subsequently partially or fully
unavailable for a few hours.

This attack is part of a series of such attacks by Killnet, in opposition to
the US support of Ukraine following the Russian invasion, and may have been
prompted by the damage to the Kerch bridges.

Although the unavailability of the airport Websites may have been
inconvenient for travelers and friends wishing to check flight departure
and arrival times, no impact was seen on air operations, and the flight
information would have been available from other sources.

"The investigators performed a systematic review of literature and initiated

they found, multiplayer war gaming was the most frequent trigger. Some
children died following a cardiac arrest. Subsequent diagnoses of several
heart rhythm conditions put the children at continuing risk.
Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and congenital

Subject: Presumptions of Intercontinental Broadband Availability
 are a significant business risk (RLGSC)

On 26 Sep 2022, the Nord Stream 1 and 2 natural gas pipelines beneath the
Baltic Sea sustained near-simultaneous breaches (RISKS-33.47).  Less than a
week later, on 1 Oct 2022, Professor John Naughton, of the Open University
and the author of "From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg: What You Really Need to
Know About the Internet", published an OpEd in *The Guardian*.  The OpEd
asked an important question:

  "What would happen if someone were to deliberately sever the worldwide
  communications infrastructure?"

Professor Naughton likely understates the hazard. "Severing" implies total
disconnection. Though less severe, the far more likely degradation is as
damaging to supply chains and society as disconnection. Critical information
systems that presume low-latency wide-area communications are widespread.
Some are life-threatening in the short term, e.g., health care systems.
Others, while not short-term immediate dangers, e.g., logistics and
transport, can easily set the stage for life-threatening consequences. The
danger is widespread and a ongoing risk.

With human therapists in short supply, AI chatbots are trying to plug the
gap -- but it's not clear how well they work.

Unlike their living-and-breathing counterparts, AI therapists can lend a
robotic ear any time, day or night. They're cheap, if not free -- a
significant factor considering cost is often one of the biggest barriers to
accessing help. Plus, some people feel more comfortable confessing their
feelings to an insentient bot rather than a person, research has found.

Subject: iPhones with iOS 14 call 911 from rollercoasters (The Verge)

Certain iPhones with iOS 14 have a "crash detect" feature that uses a
gyroscope and accelerometer to detect when you've been in a car crash.
However, other situations, such as being on a rollercoaster, will also
trigger the feature -- which then dials 911 and plays a recorded message,
tying up 911 lines, operators, and law enforcement, and possibly other first
responder services who are dispatched to the scene.

Subject: iPhones calling 911 from owners' pockets on rollercoasters

[...] It looks like the violent decelerations on a roller coaster ride are
similar enough to a car crash.  The dangers of false positives are well
known.  Perhaps Apple may need to update their phone to exclude, by
geo-location, possible emergencies near known roller-coasters?  Or maybe
ensure that as a bare minimum that the phone is traveling along the surface
of the earth and not vertically towards / away from it?  But that 'vertical'
use case could exclude a car falling down an embankment / off a bridge. So
there's also the risk of adding functions, e.g., automatic crash detection
without considering all the use cases.  It also makes me wonder if Apple
actually got real data from car crashes before designing their software
feature.  Leading to another risk of designing features with partial
data-sets.

Subject: Are school "SWATting" calls discord attacks? (NPR)

During the course of the pandemic, we have seen an extraordinary rise in
social misbehaviour, in a variety of forms.  (A friend has attributed much
of it to aspects of grief, and, having been forced to study the issue
recently, I tend to concur, and feel that this should be studied further.)
At the same time (possibly coincidentally, possibly not) intelligence
agencies have noted a rise in what are being referred to as "discord"
attacks, where foreign nation-state actors are posting material online in
calculated efforts to inflame divisions in Western and democratic societies.

Currently, false calls to emergency responders about potential or supposedly
ongoing attacks at schools (a category of what are known as "SWATting" calls
or attacks) are increasing.  Some researchers have noted coordination and
commonalities between the calls, indicating a deliberate attack along
discord lines.

I see no contradiction here. The article quotes the manufacturer as saying
that the cutoff prevents 99% of carbon monoxide poisoning deaths.  The
article does not present any statistics to contradict that claim.

Surely a system that prevents 99% of deaths is better than one that doesn't
prevent any?

I'll add that even that death could probably have been prevented by a carbon
monoxide detector that costs less than $40 at major hardware stores. The
beeping is almost certain to wake the sleeping family up before the CO
concentration reaches dangerous levels.

A common fallacy: that a human life is worth an infinite amount of money. No
matter what you do, nobody lives forever. Nor will they in the foreseeable
future. Maybe someday we'll be able to transfer human consciousness into a
computer and distribute it all over the network.  And still a network
failure...

I remember an editorial by (IIRC) John Campbell (editor of Astounding, later
Analog). He pointed out that the plot of life expectancy against age is an
inverse exponential curve. If you remove the cause of half the deaths, you
extend life by 8 years. Remove another half, you get another 8 years. You'll
never get to infinity. (And even if you eliminated everything else, there's
still the heat death.)

Subject: Re: Automakers are ignoring the simple solution to the rise of
 traffic deaths (RISKS-33.46)

Many years ago I read an article in a car magazine. In the UK the approach
to many roundabouts is preceded by a series of yellow lines (rumble strips)
painted proud of the road surface, and the car judders slightly as it goes
over them. Everybody assumes that the (clearly visible in the statistics)
accidents at the roundabout are reduced because it makes the drivers slow
down.

This article cited the (apparently only) real study into the phenomenon,
which concluded that actually, while it was not statistically significant,
cars appeared to *speed* *up* on the roundabout approach.  But the alertness
level of drivers seemed much higher.

Similarly, an attempt was made to protect country villages by introducing
chicanes, but this only increased the number of crashes as cars crashed into
the chicane itself. My mother's village had tiny rumble strips put at the
start of it, and these are noticeably far more effective. The problem is
that, in order to work, they need to be placed very close to the first house
on the road, and, of course, the residents of said house are not happy with
the noise ...

The best technologies seems to be the ones that nudge the driver - "hey,
wake up, something's not right ..."

Subject: Re: Automatic emergency braking is not great at preventing crashes
 at normal speeds (The Verge)

I have to take a bit of exception to The Verge's headline for this
item.

  Automatic emergency braking is not great at preventing crashes at normal
  speeds

However, the article says

  "Automatic Emergency Braking does well at tackling the limited task it was
  designed to do," said Greg Brannon, director of AAA's automotive
  engineering and industry relations, in a statement. "Unfortunately, that
  task was drawn up years ago, and regulator's slow-speed crash standards
  haven't evolved."

In other words, AEB works as advertised and seems to actually do a decent
job.

  AEB has proven itself useful over the years at reducing low-speed rear-end
  crashes, but AAA wanted to see how well it performs in two more common --
  and more deadly -- crash scenarios: T-bones and left turns in front of
  oncoming vehicles. [. . .]

  The results were pretty dispiriting. In both the T-bones and left
  turns in front of an oncoming vehicle tests, AEB failed to prevent 100
  percent of crashes staged by AAA. The system also failed to alert the
  driver and slow the vehicle's speed.

You can argue that we need systems to prevent T-bone and left turn crashes,
but to say that a system not designed to prevent them doesn't do so just
seems a bit silly.

My toaster oven isn't real great at making microwave popcorn, either.
