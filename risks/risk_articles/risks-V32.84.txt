Subject: General Motors expands Chevrolet Bolt recall over battery fire issue
 (Neal E. Boudett)

Neal E. Boudette, *The New York Times*, 20 Aug 2021

GM said the move announced [on 20 Aug 2021] ``would cost the company $1
billion on top of the $800M it had allocated for the previous Bolt recall.''
This means that all 141,000 Bolts produced (since 2017) are under recall.
The battery packs are made by LG Chem in S.Korea.  This is third Bolt recall
in a year.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is quoted on
the November recall (an `offer') to add software to address concerns that
some of the high-voltage batteries ``may pose a risk of fire when charged to
full, or very close to full, capacity.''  The NYTimes article says ``Two
fires occurred after that recall, including one in a Bolt that had the
updated software.''  (PGN-ed from the National print Edition.]

Subject: Why Teslas Keep Striking Parked Firetrucks and Police Cars (Slate)

Something appears to be confusing a system that Tesla drivers frequently
misuse.

On Monday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an
investigation
<https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-opens-formal-safety-probe-into-tesla-autopilot-crashes-2021-08-16/>
into Tesla. The agency claims that there have been 11 incidents since 2018
in which Tesla vehicles struck stationary first-responder vehicles attending
to the scene of an emergency; there’s allegedly
<https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INOA-PE21020-1893.PDF> been 17
injuries and one fatality as a result. The NHTSA is narrowing in on the
company’s Autopilot system, noting that the Teslas in these incidents “were
all confirmed to have been engaged in either Autopilot or Traffic Aware
Cruise Control during the approach to the crashes.” The investigation will
cover Tesla models Y, X, S, and 3 that were released between 2014 and 2021.
Autopilot’s difficulties with sensing firetrucks and other emergency
vehicles has been a known problem for years
<https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-autopilot-why-crash-radar/>, and the
feature has also been criticized as encouraging drivers to rely on it as
though it is a self-driving system when in fact it is only meant to assist
an engaged driver. To better understand the issue, I spoke with Raj
Rajkumar, an electrical and computer engineering professor at Carnegie
Mellon University who specializes in self-driving vehicles. Our conversation
has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Silicon Valley-based self-driving startup Aurora has unveiled what it
describes as the industry's first tool for assessing the relative safety of
autonomous vehicles. Aurora's Chris Urmson said the Safety Case Framework
provides a "structured approach" to assessing the safety of autonomous
vehicles on actual streets, featuring four levels of claims associated with
the safe development, testing, and evaluation of the company's self-driving
systems, as well as required supporting evidence. The framework supports a
systematic approach to assessing the vehicles' safety, as well as metrics
for measuring progress across their full development cycle.

Subject: Rain falls on peak of Greenland ice cap for first time on record
 (The Guardian)

Precipitation was so unexpected, scientists had no gauges to measure it,
and is stark sign of climate crisis.

Rain has fallen on the summit of Greenland’s huge ice cap for the first time
on record. Temperatures are normally well below freezing on the 3,216-metre
(10,551ft) peak, and the precipitation is a stark sign of the climate
crisis.

Scientists at the US National Science Foundation’s summit station saw rain
falling throughout 14 August, but had no gauges to measure the fall because
the precipitation was so unexpected. Across Greenland, an estimated 7bn
tonnes of water was released from the clouds.
<https://nsidc.org/greenland-today/2021/08/rain-at-the-summit-of-greenland/>

The rain fell during an exceptionally hot three days in Greenland when
temperatures were 18C higher than average in places. As a result, melting
was seen in most of Greenland, across an area about four times the size of
the UK.

The recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
concluded it was “unequivocal” that carbon emissions from human activities
were heating the planet and causing impacts such as melting ice and rising
sea level.
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/09/climate-crisis-unequivocally-caused-by-human-activities-says-ipcc-report>

In May, researchers reported that a significant part of the Greenland ice
sheet was nearing a tipping point, after which accelerated melting would
become inevitable even if global heating was halted.  [...]

Subject: Implantable AI system developed for early detection and treatment
 of illnesses (medicalxpress.org)

https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-08-implantable-ai-early-treatment-illnesses.html

"In trials, the AI was able to differentiate between healthy heartbeats from
three common arrhythmias with an 88% accuracy rate. In the process, the
polymer network consumed less energy than a pacemaker. The potential
applications for implantable AI systems are manifold: For example, they
could be used to monitor cardiac arrhythmias or complications after surgery
and report them to both doctors and patients via smartphone, allowing for
swift medical assistance."

I could not locate statistics on heart attacks directly attributed to
rhythm-specific conditions such as atrial fibrillation, ventricular
fibrillation, tachycardia, etc. versus those arising from arteriosclerosis,
pericarditis, etc.

The CDC estimates that ~805K US persons will experience a heart attack per
year (See "Heart Disease Facts," retrieved from
https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm on 22AUG2021).

By "accuracy," I assume the essay means the technology correctly detects the
anticipated/trained arrhythmia it was presented versus a false
positive/negative detection outcome.

Assuming there's a 12% false negative/positive arrhythmia detection via this
experimental implanted heart monitor technology, that implies 0.12*805K =
96.6K potential false negative/positive incidents per year in the US.

This false negative/positive detection rate implies: (1) For false
negatives, it means the arrhythmia WAS NOT detected by the device, and the
patient experienced the symptom, and no therapy was applied by an pacemaker
or cardiodefibrillator; or, (2) for false positive, it means an
unrecognized, possibly fictitious arrhythmia signal WAS detected and the
pacemaker or cardiodefibrillator therapy (an electric shock) was
inappropriately applied -- meaning it was unnecessary/extraneous.

for a summary of product code LWS, which documents a class of implanted
cardiodefibrillator medical device report events between
01JAN2016-31JUL2021.

That TPLC summary contains this URL which documents over 10000
"inappropriate therapy" cardiodefibrillator events experienced by patients
during the 01JAN2016 to 31JUL2021 period:

Subject: How your employer may be tracking your remote work (WashPost)

As remote work gets prolonged because of the delta variant, more companies
are tracking what employees do at home

There are a lot of things your employer doesn’t know right now —- like the
future of remote work or when the coronavirus pandemic might end.

But your activity during the workday is less of a mystery.

The pandemic pushed many into work-from-home setups, and companies turned to
employee data to keep tabs on their workforces. Your company can get access
to almost everything you do electronically, and monitoring software makes
that data easy to collect and analyze.

As some employees see work-from-home time extended because of the delta
variant spreading across the world, reliance on employee tracking is staying
steady at lockdown-level highs, say executives at monitoring software firms.

Elizabeth Harz, chief executive of Connecticut-based employee monitoring
software provider InterGuard, said one of her clients came to her convinced
that remote work would mean “economic ruin” for his company.  That was until
the client saw what InterGuard could do for his newly dispersed workforce,
Harz said. The software tracks employees’ productivity, down to how long it
takes to respond to emails.  “They woke up in 2021 and said, ‘Half of our
employees don’t even work where we are anymore’”

Subject: Critical flaw found in older Cisco Small Business Routers won't be
 fixed (The Hacker News)

A critical vulnerability in Cisco Small Business Routers will not be
patched by the networking equipment giant, since the devices reached
end-of-life in 2019.

Tracked as CVE-2021-34730 (CVSS score: 9.8), the issue resides in the
routers' Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP) service, enabling an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause an
affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service
(DoS) condition.

The vulnerability, which the company said is due to improper validation of
incoming UPnP traffic, could be abused to send a specially-crafted UPnP
request to an affected device, resulting in remote code execution as the
root user on the underlying operating system.

"Cisco has not released and will not release software updates to address the
vulnerability," the company noted in an advisory published Wednesday. "The
Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers have entered
the end-of-life process.  Customers are encouraged to migrate to the Cisco
Small Business RV132W, RV160, or RV160W Routers."

 (The Hacker News)

A Nigerian threat actor has been observed attempting to recruit employees by
offering them to pay $1 million in bitcoins to deploy Black Kingdom
ransomware on companies' networks as part of an insider threat scheme.

"The sender tells the employee that if they're able to deploy ransomware on
a company computer or Windows server, then they would be paid $1 million in
bitcoin, or 40% of the presumed $2.5 million ransom," Abnormal Security said
in a report published Thursday. "The employee is told they can launch the
ransomware physically or remotely. The sender provided two methods to
contact them if the employee is interested—an Outlook email account and a
Telegram username."

Criminal hackers will try almost anything to get inside a profitable

percentage of any ransom amount paid by the victim company.

*Crane Hassold*, director of threat intelligence at *Abnormal Security*,

after that was unsuccessful, he pivoted to this ransomware pretext,” Hassold

Subject: VPNs Could Be Vulnerable to Attacks That Send You to Fake Websites
 (New Scientist)

Chris Stokel-Walker, *New Scientist, 17 Aug 2021
via ACM TechNews, 23 Aug 2021

Arizona State University (ASU) researchers have found that hackers could
exploit virtual private networks (VPNs) to strip users' anonymity and send
them to bogus websites by tapping what ASU's William Tolley calls "a
fundamental networking vulnerability." The vulnerability monitors the
presence and size of the data packets routed along the VPN. Attackers first
send different-sized packets to different entry/exit ports, which if
forwarded signals that the targeted port is the correct one; they can then
send packets where they have altered the source address to seem as if they
originate from one of the legitimate ends of the connection. The researchers
say they have alerted a number of VPN providers to the attack, but it is
unlikely that all currently used networks will be patched. Tolley said, "Our
advice is to avoid VPNs if you're trying to keep your information private
from government entities, or something like that."
