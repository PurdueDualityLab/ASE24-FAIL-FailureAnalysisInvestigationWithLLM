Subject: Tim Cook on Why Apple News Needs Human Editors (The Wrap)

    [It seems nice to find a use for human Natural Intelligence after all,
    in this era of relying on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
    PGN]

  Tim Cook wants your news experience to be a little less stressful -- and
  that's why Apple is leaning on humans, rather than algorithms, to
  highlight its top stories in Apple News, according to the exec.  "News was
  kind of going a little crazy," said Cook on Monday night at the Fortune
  CEO Initiative conference in San Francisco, explaining Apple's latest
  attempt to curb polarization. Apple's solution, unveiled earlier in the
  day, was a new, curated tab for coverage of the 2018 midterm
  elections. The stories will be picked by human editors, and will offer
  coverage from a variety of viewpoints, from Vox to Fox News.  "For Apple
  News, we felt top stories should be selected by humans," said Cook, "to
  make sure you're not picking content that strictly has the goal of
  enraging people."

  'A detective fed an image taken from an Instagram picture provided by the

  the driver's license photo of the suspect, Elinson writes.  ``This
  digital-age crime-solving technique is at the center of a debate between
  privacy advocates and law-enforcement officials: Should police be able to
  search troves of driver's license photos, many who have never been
  convicted of a crime, with facial recognition software?'' Elinson writes.'

Possible 4th amendment violtation of the US Constitution covering
illegal search and seizure. Jacobsen v. United States defined 'search'
and 'seizure' for the 4th amendment:

  "protects two types of expectations, one involving 'searches', the other
  'seizures'. A search occurs when an expectation of privacy that society is
  prepared to consider reasonable is infringed. A seizure of property occurs
  where there is some meaningful interference with an individual's
  possessory interests in that property."

A blanket search and happenstance match across a unified motor vehicle photo

http://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/23/technology/smart-home-devices-domestic-abuse.html

  Their stories are part of a new pattern of behavior in domestic abuse
  cases tied to the rise of smart home technology.  Internet-connected
  locks, speakers, thermostats, lights and cameras that have been marketed
  as the newest conveniences are now also being used as a means for
  harassment, monitoring, revenge and control.  In more than 30 interviews
  with The New York Times, domestic abuse victims, their lawyers, shelter
  workers and emergency responders described how the technology was becoming
  an alarming new tool. Abusers -- using apps on their smartphones, which
  are connected to the Internet-enabled devices -- would remotely control
  everyday objects in the home, sometimes to watch and listen, other times
  to scare or show power. Even after a partner had left the home, the
  devices often stayed and continued to be used to intimidate and confuse.

Subject: Adverse Events in Robotic Surgery: A Retrospective Study of
  14 Years of FDA Data (arxiv.org)

Homa Alemzadeh, Ravishankar. Iyer, Zbigniew Kalbarczyk, Nancy Leveson, Jai Raman
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.03518.pdf

An acquaintance expressed enthusiasm for their forthcoming robotic surgical
procedure. The well-respected Southern California National Cancer Institute
at the City of Hope -- a hospital and medical- industrial complex -- effused
the benefits of the "world's best robotic surgeon."

Being cautious about a hard-sell, I sent a link to this report with a few
choice questions to inquire about before signing the consent form.  Wonder
what this analysis would show for the past 4+ years of MAUDE data? Similar
trend, better, or worse?

>From the summary page:

  Methods: Weanalyzed the adverse events data related to robotic systems and
  instruments used in minimally invasive surgery, reported to the U.S. Food
  and Drug Administration (FDA) MAUDE database from January 2000 to December
  2013. We determined the number of events reported per procedure and per
  surgical specialty, the most common types of device malfunctions and their
  impact on patients, and the causes for catastrophic events such as major
  complications, patient injuries, and deaths.

  Results: During the study period, 144 deaths (1.4% of the 10,624 reports),
  1,391 patient injuries (13.1%), and 8,061 device malfunctions (75.9%) were
  reported. The numbers of injury and death events per procedure have stayed
  relatively constant since 2007 (mean = 83.4, 95% CI, 74.2 [?]  92.7).
  Surgical specialties, for which robots are extensively used, such as
  gynecology and urology, had lower number of injuries, deaths, and
  conversions per procedure than more complex surgeries, such as
  cardiothoracic and head and neck (106.3 vs. 232.9, Risk Ratio = 2.2, 95%
  CI, 1.9-2.6). Device and instrument malfunctions, such as falling of
  burnt/broken pieces of instruments into the patient (14.7%), electrical
  arcing of instruments (10.5%), unintended operation of instruments (8.6%),
  system errors (5%), and video/imaging problems (2.6%), constituted a major
  part of the reports. Device malfunctions impacted patients in terms of
  injuries or procedure interruptions. In 1,104 (10.4%) of the events, the
  procedure was interrupted to restart the system (3.1%), to convert the
  procedure to non-robotic techniques (7.3%), or to reschedule it to a later
  time (2.5%).

  Conclusions: Despite widespread adoption of robotic systems for minimally
  invasive surgery, a non-negligible number of technical difficulties and
  complications are still being experienced during procedures.  Adoption of
  advanced techniques in design and operation of robotic surgical systems
  may reduce these preventable incidents in the future.

One of my back-of-card numbers routes you to a seemingly

which I've never plumbed deep enough to find the fraud department.

I once had the direct line to the fraud department -- see RISKS-27.85
for that depressing story. If only I could remember where I kept that
number... Now I just call the local branch and have them route me.

Just checked - the number on the back of my oldest card has rubbed
off. That's OK, I couldn't read it without a magnifying glass
anyway. Maybe better physical protection and larger typefaces for
critically important numbers?

Assuming your bank is halfway competent at simple, non-digital UX is also RISKy.

Subject: It's time to stop laughing at Nigerian scammers, because they're
  stealing billions of dollars (Cleve R. Wootson Jr.)

Cleve R. Wootson Jr., *The Washington Post*, 12 Jun 2018

http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/06/12/its-time-to-stop-laughing-at-nigerian-scammers-because-theyre-stealing-billions-of-dollars/>

By this point, savvy people know it's a bad idea to trust an email from a
Nigerian prince hoping to use their bank account to unload a dead relative's
vast wealth.

And they're just as suspicious of the sudden Internet-based love interest
with questionable grammar who needs a few thousand untraceable dollars to
clear up a passport issue in time for a magical first date.

But in a sophisticated and terrifying evolution of the Nigerian 419 scam,
web-savvy crime syndicates are figuring out ways to bilk U.S. citizens of
billions.

On Monday, the FBI announced the arrest of 74 people across the world --
including 29 people in Nigeria and 41 in the United States -- who
authorities say were part of complex international networks that combed
filings by the Securities and Exchange Commission, spoofed CEO emails and
successfully targeted even hardened employees whose jobs are to safeguard
their companies from financial mismanagement.

The recent scams have the same DNA as the poorly worded emails that have
been showing up in people's inboxes since the 1990s. Instead of playing on
hopes of finding love or lust for sudden wealth, they play on fears about
missing a vital company payment or upsetting a boss's boss.

``[Scammers] are doing their research =A6 going onto company websites and
looking for the right people,'' FBI Assistant Director Scott Smith, who
helped lead the investigation, told the Wall Street Journal. ``They may even
go as far as pulling annual reports and finding what companies they do
business with and [impersonating] those accounts.''

Adeyemi Odufuye and his team, for example, sifted SEC records, company
websites and other business documents, looking for the names and email
addresses of chief executives, chief financial officers and controllers,
court documents say.

Odufuye, who had a half dozen nicknames, including ``Jefe,'' the Spanish
word for ``chief'' or ``boss,'' led a crew responsible for stealing $2.6
million, including $440,000 from one business in Connecticut, according to
the Justice Department.

The schemes used a variety of tactics to gain people's trust and steal their
money, federal authorities say. They registered website domain names that
were hard to distinguish from the companies they were targeting --
impersonations meant to give emails an air of authenticity. Some of those
emails arrived with malware attachments that would snap images of a victim's
desktop or transmit key log information -- a hacker trick for nabbing
someone's password.

They even employed money mules whose sole purpose was to move the ill-gotten
gains from account to account, authorities say, disguising the electronic
paper trail from investigators.

Odufuye was extradited from Britain on Jan. 3. He pleaded guilty to one
count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of aggravated
identity theft.

The arrests highlighted just how many people are falling for the latest
iterations of the Nigerian hustle, as well as the staggering losses American
businesses are accruing. According to FBI figures obtained by the Journal,
victims of such scams reported $275 million in losses in 2015. By 2017,
reported losses had more than doubled, to $675 million. And in the first
quarter of this year, more than 4,000 victims reported $685 million in
losses. The bureau estimates American businesses have lost more than $3.7
billion as a result of the schemes.  [...]

clinched its landmark linking of a Chinese hacking group that had ravaged
American corporates in years past and Unit 61398 of the Chinese

Here's the section in question: ``As soon as they detected Chinese hackers
breaking into the private networks of some of their clients -- mostly

on the hacking group, so-called Advanced Persistant Threat 1, or ``APT1,''
the paper was a bombshell. Now five years later, the firm's methodology, as
revealed by Sanger, has resulted in a second bombshell. If accurate -- and
it seems to be, given that Sanger describes personally watching over the
shoulders of Mandiant's crew while it spied on the spies -- the anecdote
suggests that Mandiant engaged, even if mildly, in a ``hack back,'' a highly
controversial and legally dubious countermeasure.  (The firm did not
immediately respond to /Fortune's/ request for comment about the incident on

To the relief of commanders and the dismay of pacifists, Germany's armed
forces have crossed a threshold. On June 13th a Bundestag committee voted to
approve the spending of nearly $1.1bn to lease from Israel five drones which
can be equipped with deadly weapons. Hitherto Germany has been the only big
Western country not to buy ``killer robots''. In part this reflects
antipathy to America's use of remotely controlled missiles for ``targeted
killings'' of terrorist suspects (and the people standing next to them) in
places like Pakistan and Yemen.

Subject: The Tractors that Turn Farmers into Hackers (Now I Know)

So farmers are fighting back. First, they're filing lawsuits, challenging
the application of the DMCA. Second, they're lobbying state governments as
well as the federal government, seeking protection from the DMCA in this
fashion. (There's a growing movement
http://www.fastcompany.com/40518779/right-to-repair-legislation-has-now-been-introduced-in-17-states
for states to adopt a *right to repair*, for example.) John Deere is
challenging those efforts, and they're slow to come about anyway.  Urgency
demanded an immediate response. The result: As Motherboard reports,
<http://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware>
tractor hacking is growing increasingly popular.

The Motherboard reporter made his way to an online message board where
unauthorized copies of John Deere software are for sale. There, he found
dozens of threads from farmers desperate to fix and modify their own
tractors. According to people on the forums and the farmers who use it, much
of the software is cracked in Eastern European countries such as Poland and
Ukraine and then sold back to farmers in the United States.

By and large, the solution seems to work -- for now at least. Forbes warns
that this third-party software may contain malware: ``It's possible infected
farm equipment might participate in illegal botnets, or worse, the malware
might impact the safety of the operators.'' So there is some risk
involved. On the other hand, there's risk at doing nothing. As one farmer
using Ukrainian software told Motherboard, there's always a chance that John
Deere (or a successor company) will just declare the tractor obsolete. And
in that case, he asked, ``What happens [then]? Are we supposed to throw the
tractor in the garbage, or what?''

Danny Palmer, ZDNet, 22 June 2018
http://www.zdnet.com/article/three-month-old-drupal-vulnerability-is-being-used-to-deploy-cryptojacking-malware/

The update was deemed critical, but users who haven't applied the patch are
being targeted by attackers deploying cryptocurrency miners.

Drupal's content management software is a popular tool for building
websites, but this popularity, combined with the critical vulnerability
(dubbed 'Drupalgeddon 2' by some), means that attackers have found a way to
make a profit.

The vulnerability is being used to deliver cryptojacking malware, which
quietly uses the power of the Drupal user's machine to mine for Monero,
depositing it into wallets run by the attackers. The only side effects a
victim might notice is that their system is running slower, or the fan is
doing more work than usual. The secretive nature of cryptojacking has helped

Subject: Why Hackers Aren't Afraid of Us (David E. Sanger)

David E. Sanger, *The New York Times*, 16 Jun 2018
The United States has the most fearsome cyberweaponry on the planet,
  but we won't use it for fear of what will come next

http://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/sunday-review/why-hackers-arent-afraid-of-us.html

WASHINGTON -- Ask finance ministers and central bankers around the world
about their worst nightmare and the answer is almost always the same:
Sometime soon the North Koreans or the Russians will improve on the two huge
cyberattacks they pulled off last year. One temporarily crippled the British
health care system and the other devastated Ukraine before rippling across
the world, disrupting shipping and shutting factories -- a billion-dollar
cyberattack the White House called ``the most destructive and costly in
history.''

The fact that no intelligence agency saw either attack coming -- and that
countries were so fumbling in their responses -- led a group of finance
ministers to simulate a similar attack that shut down financial markets and
froze global transactions. By several accounts, it quickly spun into farce:
No one wanted to admit how much damage could be done or how helpless they
would be to deter it.

Cyberattacks have been around for two decades, appearing in plotlines from
``Die Hard'' movies to the new novel by Bill Clinton and James
Patterson. But in the real world, something has changed since 2008, when the
United States and Israel mounted the most sophisticated cyberattack in
history on Iran's nuclear program, temporarily crippling it in hopes of
forcing Iran to the bargaining table. (The two countries never acknowledged
responsibility for the attack.)

As President Barack Obama once feared, a cyberarms race of historic but
hidden proportions has taken off. In less than a decade, the sophistication
of cyberweapons has so improved that many of the attacks that once shocked
us -- like the denial-of-service attacks Iran mounted against Bank of
America, JPMorgan Chase and other banks in 2012, or North Korea's hacking of
Sony in 2014 -- look like tiny skirmishes compared with the daily
cybercombat of today.

Yet in this arms race, the United States has often been its own worst
enemy. Because our government has been so incompetent at protecting its
highly sophisticated cyberweapons, those weapons have been stolen out of the
electronic vaults of the National Security Agency and the C.I.A. and shot
right back at us. That's what happened with the WannaCry ransomware attack
by North Korea last year, which used some of the sophisticated tools the
N.S.A. had developed. No wonder the agency has refused to admit that the
weapons were made in America: It raised the game of its attackers.

Nuclear weapons are still the ultimate currency of national power, as the
meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore last week
showed. But they cannot be used without causing the end of human
civilization -- or at least of a regime. So it's no surprise that hackers
working for North Korea, Iran's mullahs, Vladimir V. Putin in Russia and the
People's Liberation Army of China have all learned that the great advantage
of cyberweapons is that they are the opposite of a nuke: hard to detect,
easy to deny and increasingly finely targeted. And therefore,
extraordinarily hard to deter.

That is why cyberweapons have emerged as such effective tools for states of
all sizes: a way to disrupt and exercise power or influence without starting
a shooting war. Cyberattacks have long been hard to stop because determining
where they come from takes time -- and sometimes the mystery is never
solved. But even as the United States has gotten better at attributing
attacks, its responses have failed to keep pace.

Today cyberattackers believe there is almost no risk that the United States
or any other power would retaliate with significant sanctions, much less
bombs, troops or even a counter cyberattack. And though Secretary of Defense
Jim Mattis has said the United States should be prepared to use nuclear
weapons to deter a huge non-nuclear attack, including using cyberweapons,
against its electric grid and other infrastructure, most experts consider
the threat hollow.

At his confirmation hearings in March to become director of the N.S.A. and
commander of the United States Cyber Command, Gen. Paul Nakasone was asked
whether our adversaries think they will suffer if they strike us with
cyberweapons. ``They don't fear us,'' General Nakasone replied.

http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/beijing-subways-to-get-bio-id-system

  "BEIJING (CHINA DAILY/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - The Beijing subway system plans
  to introduce bio-recognition technology at stations this year to improve
  transport efficiency and reduce costs, a senior manager said.

  "Two bio-recognition technologies - facial recognition and palm touch -
  are being considered, said Zhang Huabing, head of enterprise development
  for Beijing Subway, the operator of most lines in the city, during the
  International Metro Transit Exhibition in Beijing last Thursday (June 14).

  "Facial recognition technology can track passenger movements with cameras
  connected to online networks that recognise people when they enter a
  station, potentially allowing them to bypass traditional ticketing."

A 21st century city needs a 21st century infrastructure. Tracking and
surveillance of citizens is routine for an authoritarian government.  Two
systems, each keyed to a distinct biometric signature, increase correlation
potential, and minimize false-positive/false-negative matches. Hope the
reference compare files are consistent and accurate to avoid "rounding up
the usual suspects." One step closer to P.K. Dick's "Minority Report"
panoptic surveillance.

``We found that -- despite our policies and systems in place --
approximately 100 transactions including at least a protection plan have
been made with Puerto Rican addresses.''

The company said the transactions represented ``a tiny fraction'' of the

Although the Samsung SmartTV possesses an "Eco Solution" feature that

Subject: Ghost Cytometry May Improve Cancer Detection, Enable New Experiments
  (SciAm)

http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ghost-cytometry-may-improve-cancer-detection-enable-new-experiments/

A fascinating discussion on a new cell sorting technique to
characterize morphology -- shape and type -- for disease detection.

  They tweaked the typical cytometry setup and added a single-pixel detector
  --a camera that images one pixel at a time rather than thousands at once
  -- creating a device that can generate a unique signature for
  fluorescently labeled cells based on the light they emit. Essentially this
  approach produces a ghost depiction of a cell's structure, an identifiable
  pseudo-image based on the activated light particles.

  A machine-learning algorithm then uses these ghost images to categorize
  the cells in real time, and another device sorts the incoming cells into
  separate compartments.

  Although some flow cytometers have been able to image cells for several
  years, ``this is the first instrument that allows the physical sorting of
  cells based on their morphology,'' Anne Carpenter, a computational
  biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard who was not involved
  in the work, wrote in an e-mail.  ``This is revolutionary.''

No mention of the learning algorithm training regimen -- possibly steepest
descent, and the potential to get trapped at a false optimization point.

One needs to ask what the certification/license requirements are to market
this device. Do the certification requirements mirror that for embedded
medical devices, where a manufacturer only has to show "similarity" to
legacy equivalent products, and skip random control trials?

Making sure that the system was as obvious and transparent as possible for

Since somewhat prior to the assassination of the CISSPforum by ISC2 (no, I'm
not bitter.  Why do you ask?), I've been exploring the interface for the new
"community."  One of the topics has been "labels," and particularly
searching for labels.

http://community.isc2.org/t5/Customer-Support/What-s-the-difference-between-labels-and-tags/m-p/11584 or
http://is.gd/jgVt7

SamanthaO_isc2 has been helpful, and wrote:

"I wanted to provide an update to you about searching and labels. We have
enabled a filter for labels on the search page. While this does not allow
you to search for labels directly, here is where you can see the various
labels used throughout the Community, and filter results by certain labels."

I couldn't find what she was talking about.  So she posted a screen shot
which showed that you could search on location ("board"), label, author,
date, metadata, type of post, and contents with a series of buttons or drop
downs.  But these didn't show up when I went to the search page, so *I*
posted a screen shot, showing that the buttons weren't there.

And then denbesten posted:

"If my window is 27cm wide, it looks like @rslade's screenshot.  If 28cm, it
looks like @SamanthaO_isc2's."

He's right.  (Well, pretty much right: the measurement on my screen seems
slightly less, so I think it has to do with pixels, but ...)  That *never*
would have occurred to me.

Given the lack of privacy (see
http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/30/71%23subj23). you can test it out
for yourself at
http://community.isc2.org/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message

Of course, now that it's been pointed out, I can see that you might want to
reduce the complexity of the screen for mobile devices.  But you might want
to do it in such a way that it was obvious something was hidden or missing.

I think I'll go back to researching security implications of quantum
computing.  It's simpler ...

(So, if I put the window in the top left corner of the screen does it change
languages?)

RISKS-29.88, where a faulty neon sign power supply emitted RF signals
sufficient to block cell service in the immediate area (and also block car
owners from using their wireless dongles, which is what made that item
RISKS-worthy).  Stingray-style devices can also target individual phones (or
vehicles with built-in phones) and block or corrupt their outgoing calls.

I'm looking forward to the presentation at Black Hat 2025, where researchers
will show how to subvert every current model of driverless vehicle with a

the remote emergency "driver", LIDAR attacks like those described in

This blog post is incorrect and misleading.

The Florida Department of Agriculture Licensing department did, in fact,
perform the required background checks on applicants for licenses to carry
concealed weapons or firearms.  According to later news reports checks were
done through FCIC (Florida Criminal Information Computer system) and NCIC
(National Criminal Information Computer system -- the national FBI
fingerprint data base) and they also did a NICS check (National Instant
Check System), which is the name-based background check system.

What did NOT happen was that 365 applications where the background check
flagged one or more disqualifiers were not immediately rejected.  That is a
problem.  But it is NOT the same problem as claiming that the checks weren't
done.  It's also 0.001% of the applications processed during that time
period.

It should also be noted that this was on LICENSE APPLICATIONS, not purchases
of firearms.  So 365 people who shouldn't have gotten licenses did.  When
the failure was discovered, those 365 licenses were reviewed (as they should
have been initially). 74 were cleared and 291 still had disqualifiers.

As a final observation, the same NICS check that was part of the background
check for the application is done, per federal law, at EVERY sale at a gun
dealer, so any PURCHASES by these people whould have been flagged by ATF and
denied.
