Subject: The ancient computers in the Boeing 737 Max are holding up a fix
  (The Verge)

Nothing, it seems, will prompt the FAA to send this particular design back
to the drawing board. Instead, Boeing will once again attempt to compensate
for a hardware flaw on the 737 Max with slightly rewritten software. It's
the same design philosophy that created this catastrophe for Boeing in the
first place -— and it's the same philosophy that has failed, so far, to
produce a safe and reliable airplane.

In article <5.CMM.0.90.4.1586470789.risko@chiron.csl.sri.com11844> you write:
>  [Noted by Tom Van Vleck.
>   I thought RISKS has noted this before, but I did not find it.  PGN]

It's gotten worse.  Back in 2015 you needed to reboot only every 248 days:

[JL]

  [Tom Russ noted that 51 days is roughly 2^32 milliseconds.  Perhaps
  another integer overflow/wrap-around problem?]

  [Craig S. Cottingham found an earlier reference in RISKS-31.34 that I
  remembered, but could not find.  However, that item from Steve Golson
  related to Airbus, not Boeing:

    Airbus A350 software bug forces airlines to turn planes off and on every
    149 hours (The Register), which seemingly related to a 32-bit counter
    that updates every 125 microseconds.
      http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/31/34#subj4.1

  So, it's just another calendar-clock implementation foresight.
  Y2K, Why-not-2K?  It's only 32 bits.  PGN]

Privacy Cannot Be a Casualty of the Coronavirus

Subject: FTC, FCC crack down on coronavirus robocall scams (WashPost)

Americans were bombarded with more than 132 million robocalls a day in March
as the pandemic worsened.

COVID-10 Curiosity — I have heard nothing about the care which should (must)
be taken with contact lenses - Cleaning - Removal - Insertion

  [Use sterilized rubber tweezers?  Return to your old-fashioned eye-glasses
  that you alcohol-wipe before putting them on?  PGN]

Subject: Re: Firefox Cloudflare DNS (RISKS-31.65)

I had a bit of a Whaa??? moment on this, thank you Lauren for pointing this
out and making me go to settings and change them back to "no proxy".

Gotta wonder who at Firefox makes these kinds of decisions and what they are
smoking.

Changing my network settings behind my back and without notice is bad
enough, resolving domain names differently in their product (so a different
http client could take you to an entirely different server for the same URL
-- and with a different chain of built-in "trusted" CA's, both could
potentially be "very secure") is a whole 'nother story.

I guess in Mozilla-verse two wrongs make a right, if one of them's really
badly wrong.

Let me say that I *absolutely* agree with the comments Peter excerpted and
posted:

Particularly in a time of crisis, accurate and correct information is vital.
Challenging (and, hopefully, correcting) errors is a function which becomes
more important, not less, in an emergency situation.
