Subject: Taking Idol back

   [Another 1 April item, not received in time for RISKS-25.98.  PGN]

Last week, I served as a guest judge of American Idol for Newsweek.com (see
article). If you watched the show, you know how pathetic Tim Urban was, and
as I stated in my judging comments, he deserved to be eliminated. However,
to my great frustration, Paige Miles, who actually has some serious vocal
chops was sent home instead, thrusting the hapless Tim Urban upon us. I am
so sick and tired of America getting the results wrong on Idol, that I've
finally decided to do something about it.

A couple of years ago, I noted in my blog a vulnerability in the American
Idol voting system. There is a memory leak in the server that they use to
tally votes, and the phone system they have implemented is vulnerable to
dialer spoofing and scripted dialing attacks. I have studied electronic
voting security for several years, and using my experience, I spent the last
several days developing a hack to basically control the voting on American
Idol. Now all I need is a distributed launch pad for what is in a sense a
computer virus. This is where you come in. I assure you that the virus does
nothing bad. I promise it will not delete any of your files or corrupt your
hard drive, and I virtually guarantee you that it will not get you into
trouble if you download it.

If you are using Windows and you are reading this message, you are already
infected, and you don't need to do anything. If you are lucky enough not to
be using Windows, I have created custom installers for Mac, Linux, OpenBSD,
and the iPhone to make things as easy as possible for you to install. Once
you have the installer, just double click on it, and my software will take
care of the rest. The virus will propagate to any computer that you send
email to or with whom you share files. Again, I give you my word that it
will not do too much harm to those systems. All that will happen (hopefully)
is that when it's time for American Idol voting next week, all of the
"infected" systems will exploit the vulnerability on the American Idol
server and change the votes ensuring that the singers who I like will make
it and the ones who I don't like will be eliminated. I really, really
appreciate your help in this project, and I assure you that it is totally
legal and that you will not get into too much trouble. It is extremely
unlikely that your computer will suffer any damage.

Here are the packed installer files:

Mac:		http://avirubin.com/Idol.virus/Mac.html
Linux:		http://avirubin.com/Idol.virus/Linux.html
Open BSD:	http://avirubin.com/Idol.virus/openBSD.html
iPhone:	http://avirubin.com/Idol.virus/iPhone.html

It is time to take control of American Idol.

Thanks for you help!!

         Microsoft to Transition Corporate IT to Google Apps
            http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000701.html

REDMOND, Wash., April 1 /PRNewzwire/ -- In a move that may surprise some
industry onlookers, but that is being described by a company spokesman as
"making incredible sense at the bottom line," Microsoft Corporation
announced today that it will begin migrating its corporate information
technology operations to arch-rival Google's "Google Apps" Internet
"cloud"-based services environment by the start of the second quarter this
year.

"We've gone over the numbers more ways than you can crash Vista, said Hymie
Morander of the newly formed "Microogly" working group at the software
giant's Washington State headquarters.  "We're going to save millions --
maybe billions! -- by moving most of our employees over to free Google Apps
services like Gmail.  Plus we'll be freeing up resources here to concentrate
on our core competencies like Flight Simulator and stylus-based mobile phone
operating systems."

Asked if the $50/user/year "Google Apps for Business" services tier might be
more appropriate for Microsoft's use, Morander noted that, "Some of our top
executives' needs will likely justify that level of expenditure, but most of
us will be able to do just fine with the very generous allotments in the
free versions of Google Apps. Seven gigs of storage is more than enough to
hold all of my Microsoft internal correspondence, plus most of my uuencoded
porn collection!  Every Microsoft employee will be assigned a nondescript
alias for Gmail use to avoid attracting Google's attention -- for instance,
I'm bangloryman@gmail.com."

Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer emphasized that Microsoft's move to Google Apps
only involved Microsoft's internal global corporate operations, and would
not in any way impact customer-facing services such as Microsoft's popular
"Bing" decision engine.

"Given Microsoft's intense desire to enthusiastically embrace the diverse
and expansive censorship requirements of our partners in the Chinese
government, and Google's apparent reluctance to meet those same
requirements, we'll definitely be keeping our Bing and other related
public-use servers running on their current CP/M Windows 98 secure clusters
into the foreseeable future," Ballmer promised.

Founded in 1975, Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) is the worldwide leader in
software, services and solutions that help people and businesses realize
their full potential.

Subject: `Alarm fatigue' linked to patient's death (Liz Kowalczyk)

Federal investigators concluded that alarm fatigue experienced by nurses
working among constantly beeping monitors contributed to the death of a
heart patient at Massachusetts General Hospital in January 2010.  In a
report released on 2 Apr 2010, the investigators said 10 nurses on duty that
morning could not recall hearing the beeps at the central nurses station or
seeing scrolling tickertape messages on three hallway signs that would have
warned them as the patient's heart rate fell and finally stopped over a
20-minute span.  But an audible crisis alarm had apparently been turned off
the night before.  The ECRI Institute listed alarms on patient monitoring
devices as number two on its top-ten list of health technology hazards in
2009.  [Source: Liz Kowalczyk, *The Boston Globe*, 3 Apr 2010. Thanks to

Subject: Derailment of London Dockland Light Railway train, 10 Mar 2009

The following is based on a report issued by the UK's Rail Accident
Investigation Board (RAIB) but heavily paraphrased by the author.  Details
have been taken from:-
http://www.raib.gov.uk/publications/investigation_reports/reports_2010/report032010.cfm
http://www.raib.gov.uk/cms_resources/20100304_R032010_West%20India%20Quay.pdf
(RAIB Report 03/2010 issued March 2010)

Background

Docklands Light Railway (DLR) is an off-street rapid transit light railway
system in London England (it is different from the London Underground or
'Tube' system).

DLR trains are normally run under remote automatic computer control
(monitored by controllers) but from time to time are controlled by a
passenger service agent onboard, at times of so called degraded working.  At
the time of the derailment on 10 March 2009 this was the case, as the
automatic signaling had failed at a complex three way intersection.  The
person driving (for simplicity referred to as 'the driver' from now on) was
being given instructions by a controller in a control room by radio. When
being manually driven trains can only be driven at a very restricted speed.

There are very few colour light signals on this railway since they are not
needed when trains are being driven automatically. Points (US: switches)
where lines diverge (or converge as in this case) have Point Position
Indicator (PPI) display lights (at ground level) to indicate their
setting. Such setting can also, of course, be confirmed by the position of
the point/switch blades themselves.

In this accident the train ran through a set of trailing points at low speed
and was derailed. There were no injuries and passengers were detrained
rapidly to an adjacent station platform.

Why did it happen?

The interest to RISKS readers lie in the mix of factors that led to the
incident, a mix of technical and human problems, including these:

* Major long term upgrade work on the whole railway caused the signaling
  in this complex trackwork area to fail for long periods thus needing
  trains to be driven from onboard under manual control (giving a heavy
  sustained workload on controllers).

* A software change in the behaviour of interlocking of signaling and
  these points, by the upgrade contractors had not been communicated by the
  upgrade contractor to the controllers.

* The controller did not fully follow correct procedure in authorising the
  train forward.

* The controller did not monitor progress of the train (controller was busy
  elsewhere) (their screen was switched to a different type of display).

* The driver did not check the position of the points/switches for their
  intended route.

* that type of Point Position Indicator was hard to see by the driver
  (management had postponed replacement of them as not being urgent).

* The bulb in the PPI had failed (replacement of failed light bulbs in PPIs
  wasn't considered urgent).

* The driver should not have crossed points without correct PPI showing
  (driver didn't notice that no indication was showing).

MESSAGES TO TAKE AWAY:

* Equipment that might not be safety critical in 'normal usage' becomes so
  in 'abnormal/degraded' working conditions

* People's workloads that might not be safety critical in 'normal usage'
  becomes so in 'abnormal/degraded' working conditions

* If it takes a lot of simultaneous failures for an accident to happen, then
  it will happen, sooner or later.

Subject: Canada's planned electronic passports easy to hack? (Vito Pilieci)

As Canada prepares to roll out new electronic passports next year, experts
warn the technology is far from perfect and will do little to deter
terrorists from crossing our borders.

Adam Laurie, a British computer security researcher, has been pointing to
the flaws in ePassport technologies for the past five years.
The new passports use Radio Frequency ID (RFID) microchips to store personal
information about the traveler that can be used by border officials to help
verify the person's identity.

In one of his more famous demonstrations, Laurie in 2008 created a passport
for Elvis Presley, and scanned the document at an automated passport scanner
in an airport in Amsterdam. The passport was accepted by the machine and a
smiling picture of Presley was displayed on the screen.
"I think adding the biometric chip to the passport doesn't make them any
more secure," said Laurie, who is also the director of Aperture Labs Ltd., a
security consultancy. "I would say they (governments) should look very
carefully at their deployment . . . the implementation of the system is poor
and that means that the security of it is completely undermined."  [...]

A federal judge ruled on 31 Mar 2010 that the National Security Agency's
program of surveillance without warrants was illegal, rejecting the Obama
administration's effort to keep shrouded in secrecy one of the most disputed
counterterrorism policies of former President George W. Bush.  In a 45-page

1978 federal statute requiring court approval for domestic surveillance when
it intercepted phone calls of Al Haramain, a now-defunct Islamic charity in
Oregon, and of two lawyers representing it in 2004. Declaring that the
plaintiffs had been ``subjected to unlawful surveillance,'' the judge said
that the government was liable to pay them damages. [...]  [Source: Charlie

Subject: Google/YouTube refuses to Fix Longstanding Bug

There is a serious bug with YouTube and Flash Player that is affecting many
(thousands?) of users. This has been reported on the many YouTube Forums for
over a year.

It suddenly manifests itself by a refusal to play YouTube clips with the
messsage "Hello, either you have JavaScript turned off or an old version of
Adobe's Flash Player. Get the latest Flash player."

But this is not due to Javascript being 'turned off' nor the use of an old
version of Flash player. Carrying out the implied instructions does not cure
the problem. Quite why Google (in its arrogance towards its long suffering
users) does not change the text into something more meaningful is a moot
point.

And no definitive solution has yet come from the Google stable and the
forums are full of conflicting advice from frustrated users.

Google is well aware of the problem. It is also well aware of the angst of
its users. Yet it refuses to 1/ acknowledge the problem, and 2/ do anything
about it.

This lack of pro-activity is typical of a large unwieldy corporation. It
displays the same lack of inertia with regards to its hosting and archiving
of numerous (millions) of false Google / Usenet Groups with links to extreme
and hard core pornography which are mainly hosted in China. Complaints about
these are simply ignored.

So too ignored is the above problem with YouTube.

The risks: Google makes its billions and its customers' concerns are
ignored. It has a long way to go to meet even the needs of basic customer
service.

Subject: Why are we still overloading fields in 2010?

For many years, our college dining hall has offered a "to-go" option for
those who lack the time to sit down to a meal.  Recently, they have become
concerned about the ecological impact of the "to-go" containers, and so they
are experimenting with reusable packaging.  Since the new containers are
more expensive and reusable, to-go diners are expected to return old
containers before checking out a new one.

The problem, of course, is that there needs to be way to track who has yet
to return their last container.  There's an obvious solution, too: simply
charge people for the container, preferably at a rate exceeding the
replacement cost.

But apparently that idea never occurred to those in charge.  Instead, they
chose a Boolean flag: true if you're OK to check out a container, false
otherwise.  But their computer system is set up to track only one thing:
money.  So somebody came up with a clever solution (not).  From a recent
campus-wide e-mail:

> Essentially, the Blackboard system is set up to ask the question: Is
> this account eligible for container checkout?  The $1.00 that may
> show up on your account under the line item *clam shell* should be

Let me get this straight: if my account has been charged $1.00, I don't
owe $1.00.  If it hasn't been charged $1.00, I owe $5.00.

Huh?

Subject: Impossible to change account numbers

I recently refinanced my mortgage; it happened that the best rate was
offered by our current mortgage holder, Citimortgage.  (Slogan: "Citi never
sleeps"...recording: "We are open 7 AM to 12 midnight Eastern time.")

In an attempt to resolve some problems, I went to the online account I
established well over a year ago.  It wouldn't let me in, asking me to call
Customer Service instead.  Knowing what that would lead to, I decided that
I'd first explore options such as recreating the account; that allowed me to
prove that my account does still exist but didn't resolve anything.

Fine.  Approximately four calls and 2.5 hours on hold later, I finally
talked to a very friendly human.  She immediately confirmed my guess: when
your account number changes as a side effect of refinancing, the online
account is deactivated.  The only cure is to create a new account with a new
user name!

The RISK, of course, is that they are polluting their database with
thousands of unnecessary accounts, increasing the risk that an "old"
account (with private information) will be compromised.

The April 1st RISKS edition made me think that it may not be unreasonable to
remind folks of The Government's favorite joke, the Security and Secrecy of
the Social Security Number.

I, myself, was reminded just yesterday when I used my Medicare card at a
doctor's office.  In its wisdom, one's Medicare number -- available to
any/every person in any/every medical facility or pharmacy used by any
Medicare recipient -- is the person's SSN. These facilities almost certainly
have addresses, and a host of other personal information, to go with the
SSN's.

Anyhow, the receptionist asked the person in front of me for her Medicare
number (which that person read out, aloud).  When it came my turn, I asked
the receptionist if she wanted my Social Security Number, she replied - No,
certainly not, she just needed my Medicare number. I handed her the card.

Subject: Framed for possession of c-porn in UK

This story relates how man broke into the house of a woman with whom he was
infatuated and downloaded child pornography onto her husband's computer in
order to frame him and get him out of the way.  The innocent husband was
initially arrested although later cleared.  Unfortunately, the article
doesn't go into more detail about how the police eventually figured out it
was a frame-up.
  http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7081986.ece

I bet many people don't consider how well their *home PC* should be secured.
In this (admittedly bizarre) case, perhaps if the husband's PC were better
protected (my speculation) the scheme wouldn't have been possible.  Even in
cases where people have passwords on their own accounts, what about "guest"
accounts which, although they might have no access to your personal files,
could still allow enough access to the PC to leave a trail of "evidence" of
wrongdoing?

I wonder what standards are used in law to determine that just because one's
PC was used for something, the owner was responsible?  If (say) there was no
password on the machine, what proof is there of who was using it?  This
seems similar to how other types of electronic information are used in legal
situations - eg, if an automatic camera shows your car was speeding, what
standard is used to identify the driver?  Is there legal consistency in
these various areas?

Whatever rules of inference are used, clearly they could be used to protect
the innocent as well as to obscure the actions of the guilty, so balance has

The obvious question -- what's to stop this sort of scenario -- or even more
likely one conducted remotely via targeted malware, from destroying lives
when there isn't such a "lucky" happenstance of evidence pointing to someone
else?

Subject: DMV saga: I'm gay?

No, this isn't an April Fools' joke.

Gloria's driver's licence is up for renewal this year, so she was down to
the DMV office about a week ago.  Today her licence came.  When she opened
the mail this morning, she informed me that, apparently, I was gay, since
the government had determined that she was male.  It said so, on the licence
that had just come.

She was a little concerned with how she was going to have to get the
government to admit that they had made a mistake (never an easy task).  She
was going prepped with birth certificate and passport, but wondered if she
was going to have to go through some kind of medical exam.  I thought of
suggesting that she take our marriage licence, but I guess that doesn't
prove anything in Canada, anymore.

She got down to the office, and lined up at the reception desk, where you
have to get your number.  She was behind a young man who wanted some third
party (who didn't speak English) to get a driver's licence, on the basis of
some incomprehensible piece of paper.  He wasn't about to take "you have to
contact office A, and fill out form B" for an answer.  The receptionist, the
usual droid, was unable to get out of the loop and deal with the line that
was forming.

Another worker beckoned to my wife to come over.  As Gloria started to leave
the line, the receptionist got very agitated, calling out that she had to
have a number.  The other worker confirmed that Gloria should come over, so
she did.

(Possibly a mistake, since any government functionary who is willing to work
outside the process has obviously not yet had their sense of humour
surgically removed, as events will show.)

Gloria laid out all the paper, and explained that the government had changed
her into a man.  The worker got the giggles.  Gloria continued to explain
the situation, including her comment to me that I had become gay.  At that
point the worker completely lost it, head in hands, face down over keyboard,
howling with laughter.  She finally composed herself, got her breath back,
straightened up, took one look at Gloria and lost it again.  Once the
laughter subsided to intermittent giggles, Gloria continued explaining the
documentation she had brought, including my suggestion about the marriage
certificate, and the reason it wouldn't do any good.  Which set the worker
off again.

The worker had to go through and check every field in order to make the
correction.  At the end of that process, she had to take another photo for
the licence.  The camera positions are separate stations.  The one nearest
Gloria was occupied by a very, very large person-of-colour (built like a
football player), who had noticed the disturbance.  As Gloria approached, he
noted that she and the worker had been having *way* too much fun for anyone
in a government office, and the situation was explained.  As Gloria had to
pass him in order to get to the other photo station he stepped out of the
way, and said "Sorry ... Dude."

So, Gloria is back to being a woman.  Officially.  I guess I can go back
into the closet.

(I suppose this can be filed under data integrity, verification, and
identity theft.)

(Hopefully this will not have offended anyone of any sexual orientation,
skin colour, or data-entry classification.)

Subject: The next escalation in the spam war: circumventing Bayesian filters

I've been using bogofilter <http://www.bogofilter.org/>, a Bayesian
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability> spam filter, to filter
email coming into my inbox for over seven years; I even wrote and maintain
the Milter <https://www.milter.org/> that integrates bogofilter with
sendmail <https://www.milter.org/milter/7>.  Until quite recently, it has
been remarkably effective.  For example, in the past year, an average of 935
spam messages per day have passed through my bogofilter, and it successfully
identified over 98% of them as spam, with very, very few false positives.

All that changed on 10 Mar.  Since then, the success rate of bogofilter has
plummeted from over 98% to less than 85%.  In real terms, this means I'm
being forced to at least briefly eyeball well over 100 spam messages per day
to confirm that they're spam so I can tell bogofilter to retrain them,
whereas before I was seeing less than 20.  Yowza!  (You can see a 60-day
history of my bogofilter stats showing this dramatic drop on my home page
<http://stuff.mit.edu/%7Ejik/#spam>.)

The cause of the success rate plunge appears to messages such as this one
<http://jik3.kamens.brookline.ma.us/%7Ejik/sample-spam.eml>, each of which
contains, below the actual spam payload, a sequence of random text snippets
on many different topics.

These messages are coming from many different IP addresses, so it would seem
that they're being generated by a botnet.

I did a quick statistical analysis of a small subset of these messages that
I've received, 35 of them, and discovered that these 35 messages contained
10,860 unique words, of which over 68% appeared in only one of the messages,
81% appeared in one or two messages, 87% appeared in 1-3 messages, 90%
appeared in 1-4 messages, and 98% appeared in less than half of the
messages.  This would seem to indicate that the text snippets being used by
the spam generator vary widely and are thus likely to hit upon keywords that
previously occurred in legitimate email.

It would seem that somebody has figured out how to do a pretty good job of
outsmarting Bayesian filters.  Frankly, I'm rather surprised that it's taken
this long.

I've started a discussion about this on the bogofilter mailing list, which
those of you who are curious can follow at
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.mail.bogofilter.general/11492.

Subject: Re: FOSE 2010 (RISKS-25.95)

Kalin Tyler posted an ad on Feb 18 in RISKS-25.95 encouraging those
interested to pre-register for FOSE 2010 and get a discount to the
conference and exhibits.  Not a bad idea, but I had a better one, or at
least, I thought it was, at first, anyway.

I found an even cheaper way, with some drawbacks.  Dice.Com was offering
free admission to the exhibits if you pre-registered with them, supplying
your resume.  (Since they already have my resume on file it's not a big deal
to do it again.)  So I did, and got a confirmation page note saying I was
registered.

I go out to the exhibit, which is at the new Washington (DC) Convention
Center.  As the note said, I go to one of the self-check-in kiosks - in this
case, a bunch of laptop computers - and try to get an admission.  Asks for
e-mail address and zip code. Doesn't work.  Maybe I have the zip code wrong
(my home is in one zip code and my office has a different one.)

I'm trying several times and getting more and more unhappy at basically
being called out on a fool's errand. (The exhibits are interesting but
they're not worth paying to see, and I'm not going to.)  By now I'm getting
very frustrated, and, I guess, seeing a 6'2", 400 pound man in a power
wheelchair getting very angry at one of their computers because it keeps
telling me I'm not registered, scares some people, so one of the staff comes
over to help me, then he directs me to a registration clerk and tells her to
go ahead and register me manually.

I'm not the only one they had to do this for.  Apparently FOSE's computer
systems weren't able to get registration data transferred from the other
3rd-party systems...
