https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/opinion/artificial-intelligence-european-union.html

Americans have good reason to be skeptical of artificial intelligence. Tesla
crashes have dented the dream of self-driving cars. Mysterious algorithms
predict job applicants' performance based on little more than video
interviews. Similar technologies may soon be headed to the classroom, as
administrators use “learning analytics platforms” to scrutinize students'
written work and emotional states. Financial technology companies are using
social media and other sensitive data to set interest rates and repayment
terms.

Even in areas where AI seems to be an unqualified good, like machine
learning to better spot melanoma, researchers are worried that current data
sets do not adequately represent all patients’ racial backgrounds.  [...]

In April, the European Union released a new proposal for a systematic
regulation of artificial intelligence. If enacted, it will change the terms
of the debate by forbidding some forms of AI, regardless of their ostensible
benefits. Some forms of manipulative advertising will be banned, as will
real-time indiscriminate facial recognition by public authorities for law
enforcement purposes.

The list of prohibited AI uses is not comprehensive enough -- for example,
many forms of nonconsensual AI-driven emotion recognition, mental health
diagnoses, ethnicity attribution and lie detection should also be
banned. But the broader principle -- that some uses of technology are simply
too harmful to be permitted -- should drive global debates on AI regulation.
[...]

The European Union is now laying the intellectual foundations for such
protections, in a wide spectrum of areas where advanced computation is now
(or will be) deployed to make life-or-death decisions about the allocation
of public-assistance services, the targets of policing, and the cost of
credit.  While its regulation will never be adopted by the United States,
there is much ot learn from its comprehensive approach.

Subject: Chair moved to clean in control room, bumps switch, shutting
  reactor in Taiwan (The Register)

We don't often think about basic house cleaning in mission critical
facilities. Not cleaning is not an option for operator experience and other
reasons. I wonder what the literature is on that in human factors
engineering?

The Guosheng Nuclear Power Plant in Taiwan is about 15 miles from Taipei
and on the ocean. At 985MW, it provides about 3-4% of load this week that
varies between about 26,000-38,000MW

When cleaning the control room, a chair was moved, lifting an acrylic safety
cover and activating the protected switch. The switch closed the main steam
loop valve which caused the safety sequence to shut down the reactor without
further incident.

The Register tagged their article "Surprisingly a real-life scenario and not
a plotline from The Simpsons"

"The European Space Agency will on Friday launch the world's first
commercial fully re-programmable satellite, paving the way for a new era of
more flexible communications.

"Unlike conventional models that are designed and 'hard-wired' on Earth and
cannot be repurposed once in orbit, the Eutelsat Quantum is based on
so-called software-defined technology that allows users to tailor the
communications to their needs -- almost in real-time."

  (AVweb)

According to local news sources, a teenage airline passenger “virtually”
triggered a security evacuation by AirDropping an electronic image of a
replica AirSoft weapon to other passengers. The incident occurred before
takeoff on a United Airlines flight from San Francisco to Orlando.  Security
officials ultimately determined that the image had been taken well before
the time of the flight and the fake gun was not on board.  They also
determined that no malicious intent was involved.

Subject: Hackers Turning to 'Exotic' Programming Languages for Malware
  Development (The Hacker News)

Threat actors are increasingly shifting to "exotic" programming languages
such as Go, Rust, Nim, and Dlang that can better circumvent conventional
security protections, evade analysis, and hamper reverse engineering
efforts.

"Malware authors are known for their ability to adapt and modify their
skills and behaviors to take advantage of newer technologies," said
<https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/forms/enterprise/report-old-dogs-new-tricks>
Eric
Milam, Vice President of threat research at BlackBerry. "That tactic has
multiple benefits from the development cycle and inherent lack of coverage
from protective products."

On the one hand, languages like Rust are more secure as they offer
guarantees like memory-safe programming
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)#Memory_safety>,
but they can also be a double-edged sword when malware engineers abuse the
same features designed to offer increased safeguards to their advantage,
thereby making malware less susceptible to exploitation and thwart attempts
to activate a kill-switch
<https://thehackernews.com/2020/08/emotet-botnet-malware.html> and render
them powerless.

Noting that binaries written in these languages can appear more complex,
convoluted, and tedious when disassembled, the researchers said the pivot
adds additional layers of obfuscation, simply by virtue of them being
relatively new, leading to a scenario where older malware developed using
traditional languages like C++ and C# are being actively retooled with
droppers and loaders written in uncommon alternatives to evade detection by
endpoint security systems. [...]

Subject: Ancient Printer Security Bug Affects Millions of Devices Worldwide
  (Mayank Sharma)

Mayank Sharma, TechRadar, 21 Jul 2021,
via ACM TechNews, Wednesday, July 28, 2021

Cybersecurity researchers at SentinelOne have identified a highly severe
privilege escalation vulnerability in HP, Samsung, and Xerox printer
drivers. The vulnerability appears to have been present since 2005. The
researchers said millions of devices and users worldwide likely have been
impacted by the buffer overflow vulnerability, which can be exploited
whether or not a printer is connected to a targeted device. SentinelOne's
Asaf Amir said, "Successfully exploiting a driver vulnerability might allow
attackers to potentially install programs; view, change, encrypt, or delete
data, or create new accounts with full user rights." Hackers would need
local user access to the system to access the affected driver and take
advantage of the vulnerability.

Subject: ML Technique Used to Pinpoint Quantum Errors (Q-CTRL and.Sydney)

HPCwire, 29 Jul 2021, via ACM TechNews, Friday, July 30, 2021

Researchers at Australia's University of Sydney (USYD) and quantum control
startup Q-CTRL have designed a method of pinpointing quantum computing
errors via machine learning (ML). The USYD team devised a means of
recognizing the smallest divergences from the conditions necessary for
executing quantum algorithms with trapped ion and superconducting quantum
computing equipment. Q-CTRL scientists assembled custom ML algorithms to
process the measurement results, and minimized the impact of background
interference using existing quantum controls. This yielded an easy
distinction between sources of correctable "real" noise and phantom
artifacts of the measurements themselves. USYD's Michael J. Biercuk said,
"The ability to identify and suppress sources of performance degradation in
quantum hardware is critical to both basic research and industrial efforts
building quantum sensors and quantum computers."

Max Fisher writes of the disinformation industry as if his illumination

25 years ago for an English magazine, Hill and Knowlton, the global PR
firm, thought I lived in London (we had not acclimated yet to the global
presence of everyone on the Internet) and asked me to come by for a
talk. They wanted to do "brand defense" on the Internet, which meant
impersonating multiple people in Usenet groups and the like, all
forerunners of current practices. This is not new news. I wrote long ago
that "truth and lies are Siamese twins, joined at the lips," and began
with speech - or before, with deceptive gestures, as chimps have been

The bitcoin mining hardware is physically located at the power plant.

The retail price I pay for power is about 5.4c/kwh for supply and 5.2c/kwh

that the supply and delivery charges are about equal, so if the miners had

They were served with court papers, and as I wrote, they had representation

Subject: Re: "Roundoff" (RISKS-32.78)

Whether the times are truncated to the lower number of decimals or correctly
rounded makes no systematic difference when comparing results.  The
truncated values are on average exactly 0,5 part of the smallest digit value
smaller than the rounded values.  Both expand the smallest difference
between the input values into a full one unit of the smallest digit value in
the shortened number, but do so at different places in the continuum of
input values.

As long as you are only comparing results from the same data set, there will
be no systematic bias.  But if you compare truncated times with rounded
times, or compare totals of added times, there can be systematic bias.
