Actually, the ship had left from China for a scheduled stop in South Korea,
and then switched its GPS location to a spoofed fixed FAKE location near
Niigata (Japan) while returning to Kozmino.  According to the article, three
tankers tracked by *The NYTimes* from Kozmino had made 13 trips loading
Russian oil and delivering it to China, each using GPS spoofing to mask
their whereabouts.

and a failure by the agency to address its vulnerabilities.

``Evidence has surfaced that WMATA, at all levels, has failed to follow its
own data handling policies and procedures as well as other policies and

 (NYTimes)

A software glitch caused a Japanese robotic spacecraft to misjudge its
altitude as it attempted to land on the moon last month leading to its
crash, an investigation has revealed.

Ispace of Japan said in a news conference on Friday that it had finished
its analysis of what went wrong during the landing attempt on April 25. The
Hakuto-R Mission 1 lander completed its planned landing sequence, slowing
to a speed of about 2 miles per hour. But it was still about three miles
above the surface. After exhausting its fuel, the spacecraft plunged to its
destruction, hitting the Atlas crater at more than 200 miles per hour.

Subject: Millions of Gigabyte Motherboards Were Sold With a Firmware
 Backdoor (WiReD)

Hidden code in hundreds of models of Gigabyte motherboards invisibly and
insecurely downloads programs -- a feature ripe for abuse, researchers say.

Hiding malicious programs in a computer's UEFI firmware, the deep-seated
code that tells a PC how to load its operating system, has become an
insidious trick in the toolkit of stealthy hackers. But when a motherboard
manufacturer installs its own hidden backdoor in the firmware of millions of
computers -- and doesn't even put a proper lock on that hidden back entrance
-- they're practically doing hackers' work for them.

Researchers at firmware-focused cybersecurity company Eclypsium revealed
today that they've discovered a hidden mechanism in the firmware of
motherboards sold by the Taiwanese manufacturer Gigabyte, whose components
are commonly used in gaming PCs and other high-performance computers.
Whenever a computer with the affected Gigabyte motherboard restarts,
Eclypsium found, code within the motherboard's firmware. code within the
motherboard's firmware invisibly initiates an updater program that runs on
the computer and in turn downloads and executes another piece of software.

While Eclypsium says the hidden code is meant to be an innocuous tool to
keep the motherboard's firmware updated, researchers found that it's
implemented insecurely, potentially allowing the mechanism to be hijacked
and used to install malware instead of Gigabyte's intended program. And
because the updater program is triggered from the computer's firmware,
outside its operating system, it's tough for users to remove or even
discover.

Subject: Flaws Found in Using Source Reputation for Training Automatic
 Misinformation Detection Algorithms (Carol Peters)

Carol Peters, Rutgers Today, 16 May 2023 via ACM TechNews

Rutgers University scientists found algorithms trained to detect `fake news'
may have a flawed approach for assessing the credibility of online news
stories.  The researchers said most of these programs do not evaluate an
article's credibility, but instead rely on a credibility score for the
article's sources. They rated the credibility and political leaning of 1,000
news articles and incorporated the assessment into misinformation-detection
algorithms, then evaluated the labeling methodology's impact on the
algorithms' performance. Article-level source labels matched just 51% of the
time, illustrating the source reputation method 's lack of reliability. In
response, the researchers created a new dataset of journalistic-quality,
individually labeled articles and a process for misinformation detection and
fairness audits.

Subject: Failed Expectations: A Deep Dive Into the Internet's 40 Years of
 Evolution (Geoff Huston)

In a recent workshop, I attended, reflecting on the evolution of the
Internet over the past 40 years, one of the takeaways for me is how weâve
managed to surprise ourselves in both the unanticipated successes weâve
encountered and in the instances of failure when technology has stubbornly
resisted to be deployed despite our confident expectations to the contrary!
What have we learned from these lessons about our inability to predict
technology outcomes?  Are the issues related to the aspects of the
technology? Are they embedded in the considerations behind the expectations
about how a technology will be adopted? Or do the primary issues reside at a
deeper level relating to economic and even political contexts? Let's look at
this question of failed expectations using several specific examples drawn
from the last 40 years of the Internet's evolution.

Subtital: Putting the Necessity of Controls on Par with Nuclear Weapons

Industry leaders warned in an open letter from the nonprofit Center for AI
Safety that artificial intelligence (AI) technology might threaten
humanity's existence. Signatories included more than 350 executives,
scientists, and engineers working on AI, with the CEOs of OpenAI, Google
DeepMind, and Anthropic among them. ACM Turing Award recipients and AI
pioneers Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio also signed the letter, which
comes amid growing concern about the potential hazards of AI partly fueled
by innovations in large language models. Such advancements have provoked
fears of AI facilitating mass job takeovers and the spread of
misinformation, while earlier this month OpenAI's Sam Altman said the risks
were sufficiently dire to warrant government intervention and regulation.

Subject: Some thoughts on the current AI storm und drang

There is a massive miasma of hype and misinformation around topics related
to AI, ML, and chat programs and how they might be used -- or misused.  I
remember previous hype cycles around 5th-generation systems, robotics, and
automatic language translation (as examples). The enthusiasm each time
resulted in some advancements that weren't as profound as predicted. That
enthusiasm faded as limitations became apparent and new bright, shiny
technologies appeared to be chased.

The current hype seems even more frantic for several reasons, not least of
which is that there are many more potential market opportunities for the
current developments. Perhaps the entities that see new AI systems as a way
to reduce expenses by cutting headcount and replacing people with AI are one
of the biggest drivers causing both enthusiasm and concern (see, for
example,
https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-jobs-at-risk-replacement-artificialintelligence-ai-labor-trends-2023-02?op=1#teachers-5). That
was a driver of the robotics craze some years back, too. The current cycle
has already had an impact on some creative media, including being an issue
of contention in the media writers' strike in the US. It also is raising
serious questions in academia, politics, and the military.

There's also the usual hype cycle FOMO (fear of missing out) and the urge to
be among the early adopters, as well as those speculating about the most
severe forms of misuse.  That has led to all sorts of predictions of
outlandish capabilities and dire doom scenarios -- neither of which is
likely wholly accurate. AI, generally, is still a developing field and will
produce some real benefits over time. The limitations of today's systems may
or may not be present in future systems.  However, there are many caveats
about the systems we have now and those that may be available soon that
justify genuine concern.

First, LLMs such as ChatGPT, Bard, et al. are NOT really "intelligent." [...]
Second, these systems are not accountable in current practice and law.  [...]
Third, the inability of much of the general public to understand teh
limitations of current systems means that any use may introduce a bias
into how people make their own decisions and choices.  [...]

"Cleaning data to get it usable for machine learning required time and
resources, and once the agency rolled out the models for analysts to use
some were resistant and were concerned that they could be displaced. 'It
took a while until it was accepted that such models could triage and to give
them a more effective role,' Neuberger said."

Data cleansing requires skilled eyes and hands, not something an LLM
possesses out-of-the-box. Inculcating these skills into the LLM is
equivalent to outsourcing and off-shoring.

If the data cleansers and infosec engineers were given certain copyright or
patent royalties over the knowledge they transferred into the LLM,
cybersecurity engineering organizational effectiveness would likely
experience less turnover.

 U.S. critical infrastructure (cybersecuritydive.com)

https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/moodys-credit-risk-cyber-critical-infrastructure/651656/

Corporate credit ratings are affected by cybersecurity risk assessments.
This expense should motivate rapid adoption of hardening infrastructure
measures to elevate ratings based on infosec audits and preparedness,
thereby reduce cyber-insurance costs.

  Where are the skilled hands to competently rollout these core capabilities
  and to sustain vigilant operations? Cyber infrastructure engineers and
  watchdogs are hard to train, recruit, and retain. Not a role typically
  out-sourced or off-shore, unlike the domestic US computer manufacturing
  operations migrated to cut costs.

  Remains to be seen if AI mitigates hockey-stick cybersecurity cost
  expenditures while improving protection benchmarks established by
  CISA. Business expenses attributed to cyberinsurance cannot be absorbed by
  consumers indefinitely.

Subject: What Happens When Your Lawyer Uses ChatGPT (NYTimes)

The lawsuit began like so many others: A man named Roberto Mata sued the
airline Avianca, saying he was injured when a metal serving cart struck his
knee during a flight to Kennedy International Airport in New York.

When Avianca asked a Manhattan federal judge to toss out the case, Mr.
Mata's lawyers vehemently objected, submitting a 10-page brief that cited
more than half a dozen relevant court decisions. There was Martinez v.
Delta Air Lines, Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines and, of course, Varghese v.
China Southern Airlines, with its learned discussion of federal law and
``the tolling effect of the automatic stay on a statute of limitations.''

There was just one hitch: No one -- not the airline's lawyers, not even the
judge himself -- could find the decisions or the quotations cited and
summarized in the brief.

That was because ChatGPT had invented everything.

Subject: Anger over airports' passport e-gates not working (BBC News)

Passengers flying into the UK faced hours of delays at airports across the
country where passport e-gates were not working.

Travelers told of their anger at being stuck in queues at airports including
Heathrow, Manchester and Gatwick.

The Home Office said on Saturday evening that all e-gates were now operating
as normal.

The disruption, which began on Friday night, had been due to an IT issue, a
source told the BBC.

All airports across the country using the technology were affected.

The e-gate system speeds up passport control by allowing some passengers to
scan their own passports. It uses facial recognition to verify identity and
captures the traveler's image.

Sergiu Gatlan, *BleepingComputer, 30 May 2023 via ACM Tech News

Apple has patched a vulnerability discovered by Microsoft security
researchers, dubbed Migraine, that would have allowed attackers with root
privileges to install *undeleteable* malware and access the victim's private
data. The researchers said, ``By focusing on system processes that are
signed by Apple and have the com.apple.rootless.install.heritable

gain arbitrary code execution in a security context that bypasses SIP
[System Integrity Protection] checks.''  Bypassing SIP also would allow
attackers to circumvent Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) policies to
gain access the victim's private data. The vulnerability was patched in
Apple's May 18 security updates for macOS Ventura 13.4, macOS Monterey
12.6.6, and macOS Big Sur 11.7.7.

Researchers at Canada's Concordia University found security bugs in 95 of
146 popular Android applications designed for older adults. The researchers
discovered that many apps failed to properly authenticate server application
programming interface endpoints, which attackers could exploit to access
sensitive personal data. Other apps had easily penetrable accounts, with
some sending unencrypted information to either client-side servers or
third-party domains. The researchers found multiple other flaws in dozens of
other apps. Only seven of the 35 app developers the team contacted about the
bugs responded, while Concordia's Pranay Kapoor said the vulnerabilities
could be remedied by following best practices for basic security.

Subject: Google's Privacy Sandbox

I believe the big Achilles heel of Google's Privacy Sandbox, their
continuing effort rolling out in trials already, is Ad Topics, that replaces
third party cookies with an advertising API involving local device modeling
of your browsing history into predefined categories (about 350), with sites
able to receive up to three of them most highly ranked.

Google asserts that this will maintain or increase the value of targeted ads
while increasing individual user privacy by moving away from third party
cookies and ad hoc techniques used by sites to try target individual users.

Google is moving to default the various aspect of Privacy Sandbox to ON,
based on the usual hope that users won't bother to change the defaults.

I think the two words that spell the main trouble for this plan are
"browsing history." Most people are quite sensitive about this and assume it
is private. Even if shared with Google for enhanced services, they don't
really want advertisers to know anything about it.

Hell, even I feel an emotional punch when I think about advertisers being
handed information about my browsing, no matter how carefully categorized,
anonymized, and sanitized. And I know how this stuff actually works. I even
agree that in theory it's better than the status quo with third party
cookies, etc.

Is this really going to fly in the long run? It seems unlikely as currently
defined. Most people aren't going to understand it, just like they don't
understand that Google doesn't sell user data to advertisers -- a widely
held false belief that Google has never really been able to dispel. And
Privacy Sandbox is even more complicated to explain to the average
nontechnical person.

Politicians from both parties are going to jump all over this. The fine
points of privacy balance will be lost in the noise.

This is unlikely to end well for anyone.

I had one put in a used car I bought and the installer wouldn't even let me
watch.  (I suspect it was placed under the rear seat but never bothered to
poke around to look.)

I've had one in each in my last three new vehicles.  The dealer installs
them by default and the one time fee is included in the purchase price.

According to the brochure, at least, the device tracking is only activated

It's not even slightly the same. Oliver was encouraging his viewers to send
their own messages to the FCC. Real messsages from actual people are fine,
so fine that the last clause of the First Amendment specifically allows it:

  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
  speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
  assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

Sure, a lot of the messages will say the same thing, but that's
nothing new. Back in the day people set up card tables with postcards
with preprinted messages you could write your name under and mail to
your representatives. So long as each postcard was from the real
person whose name was on it, no problem.

These guys were sending fake comments using names of people who had no
idea that messages were being sent using their names. I hope the
difference is not hard to see.
