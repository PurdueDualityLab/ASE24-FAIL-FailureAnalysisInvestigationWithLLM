eyebrow, perhaps both: "Nees previously told Fox News that the fraud was
clearly evident, "because page after page of signatures are all in the same

in charge of verifying their validity were the same people faking the

Subject: Cellphone Thefts Grow, but the Industry Looks the Other Way

When a teenage boy snatched the iPhone out of Rose Cha's hand at a bus stop
in the Bronx in March, she reported the theft to her carrier and to the
police - just as she had done two other times when she was the victim of
cellphone theft. Again, the police said they could not help her.

Ms. Cha's phone was entered in a new nationwide database for stolen
cellphones, which tracks a phone's unique identifying number to prevent it
from being activated, theoretically discouraging thefts.  But police
officials say the database has not helped stanch the ever-rising numbers of
phone thefts, in part because many stolen phones end up overseas, out of the
database's reach, and in part because the identifiers are easily modified.

Some law enforcement authorities, though, say there is a bigger issue - that
carriers and handset makers have little incentive to fix the problem. ...

Subject: U.S. Lawmaker Proposes New Criteria for Choosing NSF Grants
  (ScienceInsider)

http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2013/04/us-lawmaker-proposes-new-criteri-1.html?ref=hp#.UX6Vp6SF8zk.email

The new chair of the House of Representatives science committee has drafted
a bill that, in effect, would replace peer review at the National Science
Foundation (NSF) with a set of funding criteria chosen by Congress. For good
measure, it would also set in motion a process to determine whether the same
criteria should be adopted by every other federal science agency.

The legislation, being worked up by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX),
represents the latest -- and bluntest -- attack on NSF by congressional
Republicans seeking to halt what they believe is frivolous and wasteful
research being funded in the social sciences. Last month, Senator Tom Coburn
(R-OK) successfully attached language to a 2013 spending bill that prohibits
NSF from funding any political science research for the rest of the fiscal
year unless its director certifies that it pertains to economic development
or national security. Smith's draft bill, called the "High Quality Research
Act," would apply similar language to NSF's entire research portfolio across
all the disciplines that it supports.

ScienceInsider has obtained a copy of the legislation, labeled "Discussion
Draft" and dated 18 April, which has begun to circulate among members of
Congress and science lobbyists. In effect, the proposed bill would force NSF
to adopt three criteria in judging every grant. Specifically, the draft
would require the NSF director to post on NSF's Web site, prior to any
award, a declaration that certifies the research is:

1) "... in the interests of the United States to advance the national
   health, prosperity, or welfare, and to secure the national defense by
   promoting the progress of science;

2) "... the finest quality, is groundbreaking, and answers questions or
   solves problems that are of utmost importance to society at large; and

3) "... not duplicative of other research projects being funded by the
   Foundation or other Federal science agencies."

NSF's current guidelines ask reviewers to consider the "intellectual merit"
of a proposed research project as well as its "broader impacts" on the
scientific community and society.

Two weeks ago, Republicans on the science committee took to task both John
Holdren, the president's science adviser, and Cora Marrett, the acting NSF
director, during hearings on President Barack Obama's proposed 2014 science
budget. They read the titles of several grants, questioned the value of the
research, and asked both administration officials to defend NSF's decision
to fund the work.

On Thursday, Smith sent a letter to Marrett asking for more information on
five recent NSF grants. In particular, he requested copies of the comments
from each reviewer, as well as the notes of the NSF program officer managing
the awards.

In his letter, a copy of which ScienceInsider obtained, Smith wrote: "I have
concerns regarding some grants approved by the Foundation and how closely
they adhere to NSF's 'intellectual merit' guideline." Today, Smith told
ScienceInsider in a statement that "the proposals about which I have
requested further information do not seem to meet the high standards of most
NSF funded projects."

Smith's request to NSF didn't sit well with the top Democrat on the science
committee, Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX). On Friday, she sent
a blistering missive to Smith questioning his judgment and his motives.

"In the history of this committee, no chairman has ever put themselves
forward as an expert in the science that underlies specific grant proposals
funded by NSF," Johnson wrote in a letter obtained by ScienceInsider. "I
have never seen a chairman decide to go after specific grants simply because
the chairman does not believe them to be of high value."

In her letter, Johnson warns Smith that "the moment you compromise both the
merit review process and the basic research mission of NSF is the moment you
undo everything that has enabled NSF to contribute so profoundly to our
national health, prosperity, and welfare." She asks him to "withdraw" his
letter and offers to work with him "to identify a less destructive, but more
effective, effort" to make sure NSF is meeting that mission.

Smith's bill would require NSF's oversight body, the National Science Board,
to monitor the director's actions and issue a report in a year. It also asks
Holdren's office to tell Congress how the principles laid down in the
legislation "may be implemented in other Federal science agencies."

Subject: More on That Spreadsheet Error

Of all the enemies of true liberty, war is, perhaps, the most to be dreaded,
because it comprises and develops the germ of every other.

War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes; and armies,
and debts, and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under
the domination of the few.

In war, too, the discretionary power of the executive is extended; its
influence in dealing out offices, honors and emoluments is multiplied; and
all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the
force, of the people.

The same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality
of fortunes, and the opportunities of fraud, growing out of a state of war,
and in the degeneracy of manner and of morals, engendered in both.

No nation can preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.

Subject: Microsoft re-releases botched patch as KB 2840149, but problems remain
  (Woody Leonhard)

Woody Leonhard, InfoWorld, 24 Apr 2013
The saga of botched patch MS13-036 takes new twists and turns --
including a problem with Multiple Master fonts
http://www.infoworld.com/t/microsoft-windows/microsoft-re-releases-botched-patch-kb-2840149-problems-remain-217213

According to this article, not only are there continuing problems, but the
details were not properly disseminated and details are lacking:

In an obscure Microsoft Security Response Center post on Thursday, Microsoft
recommended that "all customers who have installed security update 2823324
should follow the guidance that we have provided in KB2839011 to uninstall
it." Just about every Vista and Win7 customer who had Windows Automatic
Update turned on got the patch, but I'd guess that only about one in 100,000
customers saw the notice to uninstall the patch -- and of those, maybe one
in 10 actually did it.

But wait, that's only part of the story. MS13-036 had two different
patches. This botched patch fixed the system file ntfs.sys ...
eventually. The other patch -- known as KB 2808735 -- replaced the file
win32k.sys on all versions of Windows and Server since Windows XP, up to and
including Windows 8, Windows RT, and Windows Server 2012. (There's a full
list at the end of Security Bulletin MS13-036.)  The KB article says that
"[a]fter you install this security update, certain Multiple Master fonts
cannot be installed." Unfortunately, Microsoft doesn't mention which
Multiple Master fonts can't be installed, whether installed MM fonts would
get zapped, or if there are modified versions of the MM fonts that might
work. The KB article also doesn't say why the MM fonts can't be installed,
so it begs the question of whether this is a highly isolated incident, or if
symptoms might manifest with other installers or other fonts.

This is a foreboding glimpse into your future communications services if you
live in the USA.

I'm sitting in a high ceiling parlor in an aged brownstone at the E.9th
Street Block Association meeting.  People are telling me, somewhat muting
their anger, that some have had no phone service since Sandy, October 28th
2012 ---- 186 days ago, almost 6 months, almost half a year.  Some had their
service restored over the last month, only being out for about 5 months.

I'm in a roomful of people in the middle of Manhattan, New York City, and I
can't believe my ears. I've been a telecom analyst for 31 years and thought
I'd heard everything before - but this?

Mayor Bloomberg, with claims that New York City is a world center for
technology announced his new campaign, ``We Are Made in NY'' in 2013,
stating we're ``strengthening the city as a global hub for innovation.''

Being out of service is only one of the Manhattanites' problems. Almost all
of those without Verizon service have continued to be billed for services
that THEY DO NOT RECEIVE.

What's the problem?  How could this be happening in America?

It was an accident...

LAX worker accidentally puts up order to evacuate terminals on monitors
Brian Sumers, Daily Breeze

Monitors at Los Angeles International Airport's international terminal
briefly told passengers there was an emergency and asked them to leave the
facility Monday night because of an error made by a contracted airline
employee.

At a little before 9:47 p.m., the message read: "An emergency has been
declared in the terminal. Please evacuate." An airport police source said
officers responded to the scene at the Tom Bradley International Terminal,
believing the system had been hacked. But an airport spokeswoman said it was
an honest mistake.

"After investigating what caused the erroneous posting, LAX Airport Ops and
Information Technology staffers reported that an airline contract employee,
who is authorized to access the display system, was programming airline
check-in information into a set of monitors for a particular flight when he
accidentally activated the preprogrammed emergency message," airport
spokeswoman Nancy Castles said in a statement.

Castles said there were no reports of passengers evacuating the terminal and
the problem was fixed within about 10 minutes.

She said airport officials are looking into ways to ensure a similar problem
does not occur again.

Well... when I worked in telecoms, lore indeed was that if you didn't have
some congestion in busy times, you had too much capacity, and it's obviously
a matter of commercial judgement as to balancing the cost of losing
revenue-earning traffic in the peaks against having expensive equipment
lying idle much of the time.  I don't know how cellphone or Wi-Fi networks
'scale', but presumably having enough capacity always available to work
normally during Boston-type once-in-a-lifetime (we hope!) events would be
mighty costly, which has be be paid for somehow, either by telecoms
companies' customers, or taxpayers if run by a Government department as a
public service (like transit).  Looks like the problem here is managing
people's expectations; yes you can have a service that stands up to sudden
spikes in demand better, but how much more are you willing to pay?  And do
you want to cope with the once-in-5-years event, or once-in-15, or
once-in-50..?  After all, when emergencies happened years ago, everyone knew
that it would be difficult to find what happened or trace loved ones, now
they get angry if they can't do this immediately.  It's a bit like readers'
letters in the travel section of the newspaper, complaining about the high
price and limited availability of the Internet on cruise ships at sea;
there's no land-lines in the middle of the ocean, and those satellites are

Subject: Re: Economic policy decisions may be affected by spreadsheet errors
  (Shapir, RISKS-27.26)

First off, MS (for all that I dislike many things about them) isn't forcing
anything on this one. They provide a tool that does what it claims to do
(give a grid to put stuff in, add, subtract, fold, spindle and mutilate as
directed). The fact that it's a bad one for sophisticated economic modeling
isn't really their fault.

No one is forcing companies to buy this tool, or forcing them to create
their simulations and economic models in it. They do it because it seems
EASY, and it's the tool they've got handy (it came with their word
processor, after all). Dump the numbers in, put a couple formulas in and
BANG - there's the answer!

And that's the root of the problem - it's easy to do, and no one has to show
you how.  So no one ever mentions that you should find some way to test the
thing.  No one ever explains all subtleties that happen when you insert
cells mid-row.  No one ever looks over your shoulder to see if anything
coming out of your model makes any sense at all.  No one ever lets on that
you are in fact PROGRAMMING. And that perhaps some care should be taken.

As to alternatives - there's more than one package out there that lets you
manipulate numbers. But they aren't 'grid of numbers' simple, and a single
license can in some cases cost more than the entire MS Office suite! If it's
something that has to go through the budget committee, then it's not going
to get bought at many companies.

So yes, there's a problem, but blaming MS will not fix it, and detracts from
any real thinking on the problem.

designed to work with, it is de facto bundled.  Surely anyone can use any
utility, but the fact is, a vast majority of Windows users who need a
spreadsheet, end up using Excel.  In principle, the basic utilities of the
system -- those which are in common use by laypersons -- should be made as
simple, robust and intuitive as possible.  NotePad is a good example, Word
used to be, Excel is not.

As you say, casual users may not even be aware they are programming.  Well,
they should, and should be given the tools to do the job; symbolic names for
variables is the most basic of these, and has been around since the 1950's.
Leaving Excel in this primitive state is certainly MS's fault.

Yup.  If you click on the link to the original post, you'll see that I
wrote it correctly -- using the <sup>...</sup> HTML tags.  It's perfectly
valid HTML 4 (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/text.html#edef-SUP)
-- but copy/paste to ASCII turns 2<sup>24</sup> into 224.  (It will be
amusing to see how this paragraph gets translated to HTML.)

It's possible to handle copy/paste correctly.  On a Mac, I did a copy/paste
of some footnoted text from a Word document into an ASCII email message.
It rendered the footnote references as [1] and [2].  I was impressed.

Subject: Re: Taiwan issues duplicate license plate numbers (Jidanni, R-27.26)

I had a very similar color confusion after asking my office manager to order
numbered labels for equipment with one color for borrowed (red) and another
for the equipment we owned. It never occurred to me I'd get labels with the
same number in each series. But then why should someone not versed in
databases and computer technology realize that color was not normally stored
with other information in the database?

For that matter, before the advent of xerography, fax, Mylar typewriter
ribbons and computer printers typewriters had two color ribbons so that
negative numbers could be typed in red.

Subject: Two items on Internet use, etc. vs. distracted driving (RISKS-27.26)

There are multiple risks in building technology policy such as "don't text"
into devices. Such policies put implicit assumptions about context and usage
in between us and the technologies we use. In the case of texting in
particular do we ban apps that might semi-automatically text on our behalf?
That's aside from the practical implementation issues such as determine
whether the user is a passenger or a driver. Today would Motor-ola have been
able to introduce the distractions of car radios?

Of course basing policies on studies is something that should be done very
cautiously as this note appeared in the same issue of Risks as reports of
flawed economic studies that served as the basis for major public policy
decisions. We also need to remember that bans on using devices in airplanes
seem as much if not more due to the social concerns about people talking on
a cell phone than real issues with the technology.

The larger issue is more subtle and part of the problem of tying technology
to specific purposes. When we do so we are throwing sand into the engine of
"innovation" - the opportunity to reimagine our technologies in the same way
IP allowed us to repurpose the telecom infrastructure. In the 1970s
computers become much more valuable to society when IBM was forced to sell
its hardware without limiting it their applications.

This item is slightly misleading. The laptop was left on a bed with the
power on. The heat from the laptop caused the bedding to catch fire .. and
then the laptop went up in flames.

That is not a risk - that's dangerous!

Subject: Call for Full Papers and Structured Abstracts - 2013 LASER
 Workshop: Learning from Authoritative Security Experiment Results

The Organizing Committee for LASER 2013 would like to invite you to submit
a paper for this year's workshop.

The goal of this workshop is to help the security community quickly
identify and learn from both success and failure.  The workshop focuses on
research that has a valid hypothesis and reproducible experimental
methodology, but where the results were unexpected or did not validate the
hypotheses, where the methodology addressed difficult and/or unexpected
issues, or where unsuspected confounding issues were found in prior work.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

   - Unsuccessful research in experimental security
   - Methods and designs for security experiments
   - Experimental confounds, mistakes, and mitigations
   - Successes and failures reproducing experimental techniques and/or
   results
   - Hypothesis and methods development (e.g., realism, fidelity, scale)

The specific security results of experiments are of secondary interest for
this workshop.

*June 27, 2013* is the submission deadline for LASER 2013.

You can find out more about the workshop at http://www.laser-workshop.org.
 The website has a link to the CFP but I've copied the CFP along with
Submission Guidelines below for your convenience.

Remember that the purpose of this workshop is to quickly identify and learn
from both success and failure, so unexpected results are welcome.
