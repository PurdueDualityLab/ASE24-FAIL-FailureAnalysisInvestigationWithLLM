Subject: Security Vulnerability Discovered in iOS Mail App (LifeWire)

A patch from Apple is forthcoming.

A security researcher at ZecOps discovered a vulnerability in the iOS Mail
app that he claims has been exploited since 2018. Apple confirmed the
exploit with Reuters, and said a patch to address the issue was forthcoming.

The details: According to the researcher, the attack starts with an email
made to overwhelm the Mail app. Once the email is received (iOS 13) or
clicked (iOS 12), it could allow a remote hacker access to your device. The
attack does not require a large email, either, according to the researcher.

Since when? The vulnerability has reportedly existed since iOS 6 and the
iPhone 5, though the researcher only claims 2018 as the earliest examples
found "in the wild."

Subject: Facebook agreed to censor posts after Vietnam slowed traffic
  (Reuters)

EXCERPT:

Facebook's local servers in Vietnam were taken offline early this year,
slowing local traffic to a crawl until it agreed to significantly increase
the censorship of anti-state posts for local users, two sources at the
company told Reuters on Tuesday.

The restrictions, which the sources said were carried out by state-owned
telecommunications companies, knocked the servers offline for around seven
weeks, meaning the website became unusable at times.

``We believe the action was taken to place significant pressure on us to
increase our compliance with legal takedown orders when it comes to content
that our users in Vietnam see,'' the first of the two Facebook sources told
Reuters.

In an emailed statement, Facebook confirmed it had reluctantly complied with
the government's request to ``restrict access to content which it has deemed
to be illegal.'' [...]

In recent years, fewer customers have taken advantage of a Cox Email
account, so we decided to modify our email service to better serve our
customers. As of August 15, 2019, Cox no longer offers the ability for new
and existing Cox Internet customers to create new Cox Email accounts.

Customers with Cox Email accounts created prior to 15 Aug 2019 will continue
to receive support for those email accounts.

Subject: An ESPN Commercial Hints at Advertising's Deepfake Future (NYTimes)

EXCERPT:

Unable to film new commercials during the coronavirus pandemic, advertising
agencies are turning to technologies that can seamlessly alter old footage,
sometimes putting viewers in a position of doubting what they are seeing.

During Sunday's episodes of The Last Dance,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/sports/basketball/michael-jordan-bulls-documentary.html>
the ESPN documentary series about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls
<https://www.nytimes.com/article/the-last-dance-jordan.html>, State Farm ran
a commercial <https://twitter.com/NBA/status/1251556094960234496?s=3D20>
featuring expertly doctored footage of the longtime SportsCenter anchor
Kenny Mayne.

In the ad, a much younger Mr. Mayne is seated at the SportsCenter desk in
1998. He reports on the Bulls' sixth championship title -- before taking a
turn toward the prophetic.

``This is the kind of stuff that ESPN will eventually make a documentary
about. They'll call it something like The Last Dance.  They'll make it a
10-part series and release it in the year 2020. It's going to be lit. You
don't even know what that means yet.''  As a vintage State Farm logo appears
in the background, he adds, ``And this clip will be used to promote the
documentary in a State Farm commercial.''  [...]

Subject: Twitter Bans 5G Conspiracy Theorists From Sharing Harmful
  Misinformation (TechCrunch)

EXCERPT:

Twitter has updated its coronavirus guidelines, stating it will remove
unverified claims that cause widespread panic or encourage people to act on
conspiracy theories, after phone masts across the U.K. were set alight
following bogus claims about 5G.

KEY FACTS

The social media platform said on Wednesday that content such as ``5G causes
coronavirus! Go destroy the cell towers in your neighborhood!'' would
violate their policy and be removed.

Tweets that also violate the policy by causing widespread panic, including
content such as ``The National Guard just announced that no more shipments
of food will be arriving for two months! Run to the grocery store and buy
everything!'' will also be deleted.

However, the platform stopped short of saying it would take down coronavirus
misinformation altogether.

``As we've said previously, we will not take enforcement action on every
Tweet that contains incomplete or disputed information about COVID-19'',
a spokesperson told  *TechCrunch*.
<https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/twitter-will-remove-dubious-5g-tweets-that-could-potentially-cause-harm/>

CRUCIAL QUOTE

``We have broadened our guidance on unverified claims that incite people to
engage in harmful activity, could lead to the destruction or damage of
critical 5G infrastructure, or could lead to widespread panic, social
unrest, or large-scale disorder,'' Twitter TWTR said on Wednesday.
<https://www.forbes.com/companies/twitter>

BIG NUMBER 2,230. That's how many tweets taken down by Twitter that contain
misleading and potentially harmful content, since March 18.

Subject: Re: Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

Misuse of access to Personally Identifiable Data by police has been
showing up in comp.risks for at least a quarter of a century.

https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/17/21#subj5

Delta BC Constable Steve Parker misused his access to the CPIC computer
network to retrieve home addresses of cars parked near a Vancouver BC
abortion clinic. The only penalty he received was being suspended with pay.

BC Information and Privacy Commissioner Dr. David Flaherty seemed frustrated
about that, but speculated that if Constable Parker chose to remain as a
police officer his career would be remarkably undistinguished. Parker's 20
year police career ended with him still at the rank of constable,so that
seems to have happened.

Without meaningful consequences we are unlikely to see an end to this type
of abuse by police, or by other trusted insiders. Regular reviews of access
policy with staff are also important to reinforce staff understanding of
what is appropriate access and what would be improper access.

Digital record access is easier to log and audit. A BC Medical Services
Plan employee convicted of Breach of Trust in the 1970s for using BC
Medical Services Plan paper account files to pull addresses for skip tracers
and do on was only caught because they boasted to a relative of earning extra
income doing that.

The largest Data Breach in Canadian History involved an oath sworn Revenue
Canada employee who had been hired as a Junior Assessor in 1984 despite
having 17 criminal convictions. His name was Andreas Hackner (not Hacker -).

Subject: Re: Internet Usage update (Fist, RISKS-31.70)

As stated by me in RISKS-29:12, one thing that I found when I worked in
telecomms was how billing for services in traditional ways is a mighty
costly activity.  Telecomms and other utility businesses have to sign up
customers (and probably do creditworthiness checks) for a contract
initially, then measure their usage, periodically compile a bill to notify
them of what they owe, get the money off them, chase up late/non-payers,
handle any disputes, deal with taxes if applicable, etc. as well as
capturing and storing the required information, which all make a big
administrative overhead.  As I understand it, with e-mail the traffic goes
in and out of multiple servers in various countries so there's the
complication of different legislatures' taxation and accounting
requirements, not forgetting data protection laws of course.  Just
identifying the bill payer could be problematic.  Who gets the revenues?
And getting agreement on doing this on a global scale..?

The idea of billing e-mail traffic has been around for a long time, but
adding an insignificant charge to an existing service would likely be a
not-insignificant cost.

> Would the Information Technology Community promote the idea that we should

I once consulted for a large organization in east Asia where they did just
that.

In an effort to reduce the amount of time their workers spent on email, they
somehow hacked their Exchange server to produce the following effects:

1. Every email that was sent to an internal address (To:, CC:, or BCC:)
   was charged a low fee per recipient (it was about AUD0.03 in the local
   currency per email per recipient);
2. Emails to distributions lists would be unpacked and charged at the
   same rate (e.g., sending an email to 100 internal people would cost
   AUD3.00);
3. Emails to external addresses were not charged;
4. Charging came out of the sender's opex cost centre;
5. Monies raised by the initiative were put to acquiring more storage
   for email.

They did shadow charging for the first month, and then went live. The first
month caused some real issues for opex budgets, and angst for the P&L
owners!

I came in a couple of months after it went live, and email volumes were
down 66% compared with the same period in the previous year. Quite
remarkable.

(The same company also changed the default times for meetings to start at 5
past the hour (e.g., 10:05) and end at five to the hour (e.g., 10:55). This
gave people a chance to actually get to meetings on time, and if a meeting
ran over by a couple of minutes it didn't impact on the following meeting
starting).
