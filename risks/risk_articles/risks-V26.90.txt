Subject: An Airbus manual describes a double hydraulic failure as
'improbable'

A mechanical failure sent a JetBlue plane like this one careening wildly
through the skies, sparking panic among the 155 people aboard the Las Vegas
to New York flight, passengers told The Post yesterday.

"It was four hours of hell," said Travis McGhie, who described how the plane
kept lurching from side to side and going into steep turns when its
hydraulic system failed Sunday.  ...  The side-to-side weaving was likely a
sign that the pilots had lost lateral control, said Dave Esser, a professor
at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida.

An Airbus manual describes a double hydraulic failure as "improbable in
operation." ...  [*NY Post*]

Baxa also sells a medical compounder using a Microsoft operating system with
the gotcha that ``any unauthorized programs installed on a Baxa product will
void the manufacturer's warranty.''  For instance, the Baxa `Preventing

Readers contributed a couple updates OOB regarding malware and medical

Hat tip to Shawn Merdinger who points out that CareFusion appears to violate the spirit of its own legal disclaimer concerning not to "post or transmit any information or software which contains a virus, trojan horse, worm or other harmful component."  It also says, "By using the CareFusion.com web site, including any software and content contained therein, you agree that the use of the Site is entirely at your own risk.... THIS DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY APPLIES TO DAMAGES OR INJURY CAUSED BY ... COMPUTER VIRUS." This technique reminds me of Riegel vs. Medtronic, but so much more efficient when a manufacturer can simply disclaim malware liability in medical device software.

The CLEAN MX realtime database offers further details on the infection. According to CLEAN MX, the web server was infected with the "JS/Redirector.JL.1" virus for 1666.3 hours from March 23, 2012 to May 31, 2012.  Also, the Department of Homeland Security wrote to me that according to http://web-sniffer.net/, the site seems to be running an old version of .NET.

Subject: 60% of Wikipedia entries about companies contain errors

If you are at all interested in the issue, I urge you to
read the original published article, at
http://www.prsa.org/Intelligence/PRJournal/Documents/2012DiStaso.pdf

I have done so, and the *Science News* article is a fair summary of
the findings.  I would paraphrase the original article as "Because
the Wikipedia is rightly so well respected, it's important that
information about companies should be correct, and our survey shows
that PR professionals who try to get factual errors corrected often
experience serious difficulty and long delays."

The difficulty people experience in getting incorrect computerised
information corrected is no new topic in RISKS.

The one thing which _is_ misleading is the 60% figure.  You would
think that someone had taken a sample of Wikipedia pages about
companies and discovered that 60% of them contained (possibly minor)
errors.  The study surveyed a sample of PR professionals.  Paraphrasing
again, out of those who answered "yes" to "does the company you
represent have a Wikipedia entry that you know about", 60% went on to
answer "yes" to "does that entry contain factual errors".  The error
rate in company entries as such remains unknown.

Mike Flacy, Digital Trends, 29 May 2012

As mentioned by the BBC News recently, a 17-year-old girl was visiting her
grandmother in Sydney, Australia when she took a picture of a "large sum of
cash" while helping her grandmother count her cash savings at the home. The
teenager posted the picture on her Facebook feed around 4 p.m. on Thursday
May 24. Approximately seven hours later, two masked men armed with a wooden
club and a knife entered the girl's family home 75 miles away in the town of
Bundanoon. Upon entering the family home, the men found the 47-year-old
mother of the girl as well as a 58-year-old man and 14-year-old boy, likely
her father and brother.

When speaking to the family, the two men wanted to talk to the girl
about the sum of money in the picture that was posted on Facebook. ...

Actually, it does, and you have missed the main point amongst the fuss

attacks.

The point of Poul-Henning's announcement is that (ii) is not sufficient in
the event that (iii) fails. The reason is that MD5 is optimised for speed,
so an attacker is able to use brute force to recover password plaintexts
in reasonable time. So as well as salting you need to use many iterations
of the hash function in order to slow down a brute-force recovery attack
enough to make it infeasible.

Recently several people have written good articles to explain this:
http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/06/how-companies-can-beef-up-password-security/
http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002095.html
http://throwingfire.com/storing-passwords-securely/

Now, PHK's MD5 crypt() uses 1000 iterations, so it is a lot more secure
than a naive salted hash. But still, it is not secure enough given the
performance of current computers and GPU-optimised MD5 implementations.

The articles all mention bcrypt() which is based on Blowfish instead of
MD5. It has the advantage (for this purpose) of requiring a large state
space, so it is harder to speed it up using GPUs. They also mention
scrypt() which is designed to use a fairly large amount of memory, more
than fits in the CPU cache, so that its performance is limited by memory
speed more than CPU speed - and memory technology does not speed up like
CPUs.

Subject: Re: MD5 password scrambler 'no longer safe' (Kemp, RISKS-26.89)

Allow me to inject a minimum of fact into the discussion, as someone who
has known Poul-Henning for many years and actually took the time to read
what he wrote and not just the regurgitation of a journalist who clearly
does not understand the issue:

Poul-Henning's point has nothing to do with real or imagined inherent
weaknesses in MD5.  His point is that known-hash attacks against MD5 are
too easy because MD5 is fast on modern hardware.  Neither did he claim
any connection between the LinkedIn breach and his code; he just thought
it was a good occasion to remind people that times change.

For the record, I don't agree with him - picking a slow algorithm only
slows the attack down arithmetically.  I believe in increasing the key
space, which slows the attack down geometrically.  The best long-term
solution is probably to switch from passwords to passphrases.

> (i) Online password retries must be limited

Irrelevant in the case of a known-hash attack, which is the premise for
this discussion.

> (ii) Passwords should be stored "salted" - i.e.. where the cleartext

Poul-Henning's MD5 algorithm is indeed salted.  That doesn't matter for
known-hash attacks, since the salt is known to the attacker.

LinkedIn's password hashes were not salted, but they are now:

  It is worth noting that the affected members who update their
  passwords and members whose passwords have not been compromised
  benefit from the enhanced security we just recently put in place,
  which includes hashing and salting of our current password databases.

The bit about "members whose passwords have not been compromised"
worries me.  It implies that they either a) have a copy of the cleartext
passwords and are therefore able to rehash them immediately, or b) won't
rehash those passwords until the next time the user logs in.  I don't
much like either option, but I dislike option b) less than option a).

> (iii) Password databases should be stored securely

Once again, the premise is that the hash is known to the attacker.

Subject: Re: MD5 password scrambler 'no longer safe' (Kemp, RISKS-26.89)

In the third paragraph of John Kemp's piece on MD5 (RISKS 26.89), he states
that 'When people have said that "MD5 is broken" they mean that MD5 is
subject to "collision attacks" in which two different cleartext values can
hash to the same value.'  This is true but not useful.  By definition, a
hash is a digest of a message *which is, except for very short messages,
shorter than the original message*.  So the range space of a hash is much
smaller than its domain space, so many different possible (but not
necessarily human-intelligible) messages map to the same hash value.  This
is a property of the hash problem, regardless of the hash algorithm.  So
MD5, SHA-1, and all past, present and future hash algorithms contain
potential collisions.  However, if it is possible, given a hash value, to
generate a source message (not necessarily the original message) which
hashes to that value, then the hash algorithm is truly broken (as it is
effectively not reversible).

Ironically, password storage is one application where the "messages" (the
passwords) are typically very short (i.e. shorter than their hashes);
however, designing a hash algorithm to be completely collision-free for very
short messages would probably introduce enough "structure" to enable a
cryptographer to reverse-engineer the algorithm ... which would break the
algorithm.

Error code 451: an HTTP error for censorship? One would imagine that after
legal censorship there would be either a password protected gateway or more
simply no page to not return.

XML creator Tim Bray has proposed a new HTTP error code: 451, "Legally
restricted." The idea is to create an unambiguous code that ISPs can return
when a user requests a page that has been censored by a court or
government. Note the specific number of the error code. Bray thanks Ray
Bradbury in the footnotes."

Subject: FBI, DEA warn IPv6 could shield criminals from police

[Relating to CNET Mobile via Dave Farber's IP]
http://m.cnet.com/news/fbi-dea-warn-ipv6-could-shield-criminals-from-police/57453738

Relax.  This has nothing to do with criminals.  It's cop bluster designed to
get us to wiretap ourselves "before the cops get Congress to force us to".

The actual situation is that the shortage of IPv4 addresses (plus routing
constraints) required careful allocation of IPv4 addresses.  These needs
were addressed through a cumbersome and intrusive global bureaucracy led by
ICANN, ARIN, RIPE and APNIC.  Those bureaucracies ended up building a big
database of who-has-what-addresses, containing every customer of every ISP
who had a fixed IP address.  All sorts of cops and busybodies around the
world got used to having that database, in order to turn arbitrary IP
addresses into names to harass, and physical addresses where the honest
among those people might be harassed.

There's no need for such global databases of IPv6 addresses, which can be
allocated in large chunks to ISPs and then allocated locally by the ISPs in
any manner that pleases them and their customers.

This blather from cops, via Declan who should know better, is solely to
encourage the intrusive global bureaucracies (and their ISP customers) to
build the same kind of database.  Not for the bureaucracies' own
convenience; it's endless nitpicking work and always wrong.  Nor for the
convenience of Internet users nor ISPs, who hate the existing bureaucracy
for 'justifying' their need for niggardly dribs of IPv4 addresses.

It's all for the convenience of cops.  They love systems that collect reams
of data about everyone, guilty or innocent.  Then they can go trolling
through that data without warrants, whenever they feel like it.  For
example, they get hundreds of thousands of copies of your phone bills every
month, without notice to you, just because they can, to see who you were
calling, and from where.

Tell them where to stick it.  Our identities as online communicators are
none of the government's business.  We are innocent until proven guilty.
FBI, DEA, NSA, and RCMP can, and should, stop their totalitarian strategies
and tactics.  They can "Come back with a warrant", and serve it on an ISP,
if there's a real issue about a particular IP address.

Under current law, a mere subpoena to an ISP suffices to get all their
records about you (an ISP customer), under the dubious legal theory that
"you have no 4th Amendment protection for data about you that's held by
somebody else" (California Bankers Association v. US, 416 U.S. 21 (1974)).
Cops can issue subpoenas themselves, without even asking a judge.  So the
lack of a big database about all of us is really no problem for police.
They're just lazy.  "A policeman's job is only easy in a police state", as
Orson Welles wrote in 1958.

Data lost or breached at 82.5 per cent of government IT systems in Canada
A new McAfee study suggests IT managers at all levels of government in

This overconfidence is one risk, but there is another with statistics.

Government IT managers in Canada are over-confident and reactive rather than
proactive when it comes to protecting public data from security threats, a
new study suggests.

Although 97.5 per cent of government IT security software decision makers
say their systems have been exposed to some sort of direct security threat
or challenge in the past year =96 and 82.5 per cent have suffered a data
loss or breach in the same period -- 80 per cent of them still feel

mission critical data.

Leger Marketing surveyed 40 randomly selected IT managers responsible for
security software decisions at the federal, provincial and municipal
government levels. They were polled in February for security software vendor
McAfee Canada.

Now, it comes out that the sample is only 40.  Throughout the article, the
results are stated to three significant digits when the result in the sample

What you really need to know about cloud security

selected text (There is more interesting stuff.):

One troubling trend uncovered in the Sony breach is that hackers view the
cloud not necessarily as a target, but as a resource. Hackers used stolen
credit cards to rent Amazon EC2 servers and launch the crippling attack on
Sony.

"Everything the cloud offers to legitimate businesses it offers to criminals
as well," says Scott Roberts, senior intelligence specialist at Vigilant, a
security monitoring company. "It's becoming common for cyber-criminals to
rent cloud infrastructure to set up spambots or to build out a malware
command and control infrastructure. At $50 or $60 a month, attackers can
take advantage of resources that a few years ago would be too difficult and
too expensive to build on their own."

Sweet discussed a client CloudPassage worked with (who prefers to remain
anonymous) who had development servers in the cloud. A hacker placed a
rootkit onto one of the virtual servers. When the developers noticed
something was off with their servers, they brought them back behind the
corporate firewall to re-image them. Unfortunately, they brought the rootkit
in with them, infecting their entire network.

  there. Facebook has collected the most extensive data set ever assembled

Subject: Stolen passwords, or chum to catch passwords?  Lastpass.com

Regarding the (alleged) 6M+ stolen passwords from LinkedIn:

They may really be stolen passwords, but suppose we put up a site that said:

"See if your password to <Organization's name here> was stolen.  Please
enter your password here and the encrypted version will be matched against
the list of stolen passwords: _______"

You are likely to get a lot of fish to bite on that hook.  You can identify
the fish by their IP or their cookies.

Such a site?  https://lastpass.com/linkedin/

There were two kinds of sites that offered to check your password as to
whether it was in the captured list.  One kind accepted a plaintext password
and generated the hashed password; the other only accepted a hashed password
(which it told you how to create).

Actually, that particular site probably had honest intentions.  However, it
pointed out this problem of submitting a password and suggested that users
look at the page's source code to confirm that the plaintext password was
not transmitted (as though most people can figure this out).

HOWEVER, even submitting your hashed password to a site is still unsafe.  If
the site can determine who submits it (by IP, cookies, referring link, etc.)
and can thereby guess the account of the submitter, and is able to know
(now, or later) the paintext password for that hash, then the account is
compromised.

The problem ("Let me test your password to see if it is
compromised/safe/secure") is real and is one that many, or most, users might
not recognize.  Letting people think that sites that do this are safe may
make opportunities for sites that have bad intent.

It might be worth pointing out the papers about passwords referenced here:

Subject: Serious new MySQL security vulnerability

  "A serious security vulnerability discovered in MySQL was disclosed this
  weekend. It basically allows anyone to bypass authentication and login
  directly into the database. We tried on a few 64bit Ubuntu systems and
  were able to replicate the issue (it seems that only 64 bit platforms are
  affected)."  http://j.mp/LXunyu  (Sucuri via NNSquad)

Of course, having MySQL accessible directly from the Net without connection
restrictions is A Bad Idea in any case.

Subject: The Vulnerabilities Market and the Future of Security

http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceschneier/2012/05/30/the-vulnerabilities-market-and-the-future-of-security/

The Vulnerabilities Market and the Future of Security

Recently, there have been several articles about the new market in zero-day
exploits: new and unpatched computer vulnerabilities. It's not just software
companies, who sometimes pay bounties to researchers who alert them of
security vulnerabilities so they can fix them. And it's not only criminal
organizations, who pay for vulnerabilities they can exploit. Now there are
governments, and companies who sell to governments, who buy vulnerabilities
with the intent of keeping them secret so they can exploit them.

This market is larger than most people realize, and it's becoming even
larger.  Forbes recently published a price list for zero-day exploits, along
with the story of a hacker who received $250K from "a U.S. government
contractor" (At first I didn't believe the story or the price list, but I
have been convinced that they both are true.) Forbes published a profile of
a company called Vupen, whose business is selling zero-day exploits. Other
companies doing this range from startups like Netragard and Endgame to large
defense contractors like Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, and Raytheon.

This is very different than in 2007, when researcher Charlie Miller wrote
about his attempts to sell zero-day exploits; and a 2010 survey implied that
there wasn't much money in selling zero days. The market has matured
substantially in the past few years.

This new market perturbs the economics of finding security
vulnerabilities. And it does so to the detriment of us all.

I've long argued that the process of finding vulnerabilities in software
system increases overall security. This is because the economics of
vulnerability hunting favored disclosure. As long as the principal gain from
finding a vulnerability was notoriety, publicly disclosing vulnerabilities
was the only obvious path. In fact, it took years for our industry to move
from a norm of full-disclosure - announcing the vulnerability publicly and
damn the consequences - to something called "responsible disclosure": giving
the software vendor a head start in fixing the vulnerability. Changing
economics is what made the change stick: instead of just hacker notoriety, a
successful vulnerability finder could land some lucrative consulting gigs,
and being a responsible security researcher helped. But regardless of the
motivations, a disclosed vulnerability is one that - at least in most cases
- is patched. And a patched vulnerability makes us all more secure.

This is why the new market for vulnerabilities is so dangerous; it results
in vulnerabilities remaining secret and unpatched. That it's even more
lucrative than the public vulnerabilities market means that more hackers
will choose this path. And unlike the previous reward of notoriety and
consulting gigs, it gives software programmers within a company the
incentive to deliberately create vulnerabilities in the products they're
working on - and then secretly sell them to some government agency.

No commercial vendors perform the level of code review that would be
necessary to detect, and prove mal-intent for, this kind of sabotage.

Even more importantly, the new market for security vulnerabilities results
in a variety of government agencies around the world that have a strong
interest in those vulnerabilities remaining unpatched. These range from
law-enforcement agencies (like the FBI and the German police who are trying
to build targeted Internet surveillance tools, to intelligence agencies like
the NSA who are trying to build mass Internet surveillance tools, to
military organizations who are trying to build cyber-weapons.

All of these agencies have long had to wrestle with the choice of whether to
use newly discovered vulnerabilities to protect or to attack. Inside the
NSA, this was traditionally known as the "equities issue," and the debate
was between the COMSEC (communications security) side of the NSA and the
SIGINT (signals intelligence) side. If they found a flaw in a popular
cryptographic algorithm, they could either use that knowledge to fix the
algorithm and make everyone's communications more secure, or they could
exploit the flaw to eavesdrop on others - while at the same time allowing
even the people they wanted to protect to remain vulnerable. This debate
raged through the decades inside the NSA. From what I've heard, by 2000, the
COMSEC side had largely won, but things flipped completely around after
9/11.

The whole point of disclosing security vulnerabilities is to put pressure on
vendors to release more secure software. It's not just that they patch the
vulnerabilities that are made public - the fear of bad press makes them
implement more secure software development processes. It's another economic
process; the cost of designing software securely in the first place is less
than the cost of the bad press after a vulnerability is announced plus the
cost of writing and deploying the patch. I'd be the first to admit that this
isn't perfect - there's a lot of very poorly written software still out
there - but it's the best incentive we have.

We've always expected the NSA, and those like them, to keep the
vulnerabilities they discover secret. We have been counting on the public
community to find and publicize vulnerabilities, forcing vendors to fix
them. With the rise of these new pressures to keep zero-day exploits secret,
and to sell them for exploitation, there will be even less incentive on
software vendors to ensure the security of their products.

As the incentive for hackers to keep their vulnerabilities secret grows, the
incentive for vendors to build secure software shrinks. As a recent EFF
essay put it, this is "security for the 1%." And it makes the rest of us
less safe.

Subject: Privacy Breach Discovered In Internet Address Bids

AP: Privacy Breach Discovered In Internet Address Bids via NNSquad
http://j.mp/MvHLMa  (AP / NPR)

  "This spring, ICANN had to suspend access to its system for letting
  bidders submit proposals after it discovered technical glitches that
  exposed some private data. That took more than a month to fix and
  restore. ICANN also goofed during Wednesday's announcement. It displayed
  Arabic names left to right rather than right to left, as the language is
  written.  The latest breach provided more fodder for critics of ICANN and
  the name expansion. Skeptics have questioned ICANN's ability to run the
  program smoothly in the long run, given that technical problems have
  cropped up early on.  "If this weren't all so incredibly serious, one
  could get quite a laugh over the concept of The Gang That Couldn't Shoot
  Straight being in charge of this process," Lauren Weinstein, co-founder of
  People For Internet Responsibility, said on his Privacy Forum mailing
  list."

One might have hoped that a few hundred million dollars in gTLD application
fees might have helped to enable at least basic technical competency.
Obviously not.

Subject: ICANN's Call For New Domain Names Brings Criticism, and $357M

http://j.mp/LnWM1i  (This message on Google+)
http://j.mp/LnVGTb  (NPR)

  Another company, Afilias, says it applied for 305 top level domains,
  either on its own behalf or for its clients. The company currently
  operates .info and .mobi, among other enterprises.  In a report for All
  Things Considered, NPR's Yuki Noguchi spoke to Roland LaPlante, a senior
  vice president at Afilias, about what companies want with the new domains.
  "They'll have complete control over what goes on in their top level
  domain. And that means in those domains there will be no spam, no
  phishing, no malware, none of the other evil things that are happening on
  the Internet today," LaPlante told Yuki. "So there's a big security
  benefit to having your own top level domain, particularly if
  counterfeiting has been an issue for you."

I really have to call out this particular quote, because it's a classic
example of a Big Lie in action.  It is the very *existence* of all these new
TLDs that will enable vast new empires of spam, phishing, malware, and the
rest, because bad players will forge and use other obfuscation techniques to
confuse Internet users via those names.  There is no need for them to
actually be in those TLDs for real -- and Afilias must already know this.
