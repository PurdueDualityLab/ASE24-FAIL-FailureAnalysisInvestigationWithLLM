Tonya Riley, *The Washington Post, 7 Jan 2021
Riot in the Capitol is a nightmare scenario for cybersecurity professionals

Lawmakers and congressional staff were ushered into secure locations as a
mob backing President Trump violently stormed the U.S. Capitol in hopes of
overturning the election he lost.

The assault -- which only temporarily delayed the certification of
president-elect Joe Biden's win -- left many unanswered questions about
security at the Capitol, including its cybersecurity.  The quick evacuation
left computers and other device unattended as the mob ransacked offices.

Wednesday's insurrection could have exposed congressional data and devices
in ways that have yet to be appreciated.  [...]

Given the scope of the intrusion, Coleman and others say that it's important
to assume that any device could have been compromised and remediate the
breach with that scale and scope in mind. But he and others emphasize that
rather than replacing every device and cable in the entire congressional
orbit, constant vigilance and an ‚Äúassume breach‚Äù
mentality will be the best defense going forward. The Economic Development
Administration took an ill-advised maximalist approach after a 2011
compromise, launching a massive campaign
<https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/07/us-agency-baffled-by-modern-technology-destroys-mice-to-get-rid-of-viruses/>
to physically destroy all of its digital equipment, including desktop
computers, printers, cameras, mice, and keyboards -- most of which were
uninfected. The effort concluded only when the agency ran out of money for
the project.

Congress needn't take an action so dramatic as that. But it also must
acknowledge how exposed Wednesday's incident has left it.

It is important to design APIs so that they are reasonably secure. It is
reported that the Parler API was open (e.g. did not require authentication).
Further more, the geo-tagging inherent in JPEG was provided on public

accessed by at least one third party.

I guess that the individuals who implemented Parler were not well-read on

Subject: ESS voting machine company sends threats (Andrew Appel)

Andrew Appel <appel@princeton.edu> has another RISKS-relevant article on
freedom-to-tinker:

https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2021/01/11/ess-voting-machine-company-sends-threats/

ESS voting machine company sends threats, 11 Jan 2021

For over 15 years, election security experts and election integrity
advocates have been communicating to their state and local election
officials the dangers of touch-screen voting machines. The danger is simple:
if fraudulent software is installed in the voting machine, it can steal
votes in a way that a recount wouldn't be able to detect or correct. That
was true of the paperless touchscreens of the 2000s, and it's still true of
the ballot-marking devices (BMDs) and *all-in-one* machines such as the ES&S
ExpressVote XL voting machine ( [
https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/bmd-insecure.pdf | see section 8
of this paper ] *). This analysis is based on the characteristics of the
technology itself, and doesn't require any conspiracy theories about who
owns the voting-machine company.

In contrast, if an optical-scan voting machine was suspected to be hacked,
the recount can assure an election outcome reflects the will of the voters,
because the recount examines the very sheets of paper that the voters marked
with a pen. In late 2020, many states were glad they used optical-scan
voting machines with paper ballots: the recounts could demonstrate
conclusively that the election results were legitimate, regardless of what
software might have been installed in the voting machines or who owned the
voting-machine companies. In fact, the vast majority of the states use
optical-scan voting machines with hand-marked paper ballots, and in 2020 we
saw clearly why that's a good thing.

In November and December 2020, certain conspiracy theorists made
unsupportable claims about the ownership of Dominion Voting Systems, which
manufactured the voting machines used in Georgia. [
https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/politics/dominion-voting-defamation-lawsuit/index.html

Dominion has sued for defamation

  [For example, PGN suggests looking at this WashPost item:
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/dominion-sues-pro-trump-lawyer-sidney-powell-seeking-more-than-13-billion/2021/01/08/ebe5dbe0-5106-11eb-b96e-0e54447b23a1_story.html
  ]

Dominion is the manufacturer of voting machines used in many states. Its
rival, Election Systems and Software (ES&S), has an even bigger share of the
market.

Apparently, ES&S must think that amongst all that confusion, the time is
right to send threatening Cease & Desist letters to the legitimate critics
of their ExpressVote XL voting machine. Their lawyers sent [
https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2021-01-04-cease-and-desist-letter-to-smart-elections-0029787725-1/
| this letter ] to the leaders of [ https://smartelections.us/ | SMART
Elections ] , a journalism+advocacy organization in New York State who have
been communicating to the New York State Board of Elections, explaining to
the Board why it's a bad idea to use the ExpressVote XL in New York (or in
any state).

ES&S's lawyers claim that certain facts (which they call *accusations*) are
*false, defamatory, and disparaging*, namely: that the ``ExpressVote XL can
add, delete, or change the votes on individual ballots'', that the
ExpressVote XL will ``deteriorate our security and our ability to have
confidence in our elections,'' and that it is a ``bad voting machine.''

Well, let me explain it for you. The ExpressVote XL, if hacked, can add,
delete, or change votes on individual ballots -- and no voting machine is
immune from hacking. That's why optical-scan voting machines are the way to
go, because they can't change what's printed on the ballot. And let me
explain some more: The ExpressVote XL, if adopted, will deteriorate our
security and our ability to have confidence in our elections, and indeed it
is a bad voting machine. And expensive, too!

It's been clearly explained in the peer-reviewed literature how touch-screen
voting machines -- even the ones like the XL that print out paper ballots --
can (if hacked) alter votes; and how most voters won't notice; and how even
if some voters do notice, there's no way to correct the election result. And
it's been explained why machines like the ExpressVote XL are particularly
insecure -- as I said, [
https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/bmd-insecure.pdf | see section 8
of this paper ] *.

And it's pretty clear that the folks at SMART Elections are aware of these
scientific studies, and are basing their journalism and advocacy on good
science.

I'll summarize here what's explained in the paper: how the ExpressVote XL,
if hacked, can change votes. If the machine is hacked, the software can do
whatever the hacker has programmed, but the hacker can't change the
hardware. The hardware includes a thermal printer that can make black marks
(i.e., print text or barcodes or whatever) on the paper, but the hardware
can't erase marks. Therefore you might think the ExpressVote XL, even if
hacked, couldn't alter votes. But consider this: suppose there are 15
contests on the ballot; suppose the voter makes choices for all 13 contests
and chooses not to vote for State Senator. Then what the legitimate software
does is, in the line for State Senator, print NO SELECTION MADE. But the
hacked software could simply leave that line blank -- then, when the voter
has reviewed the ballot (or not bothered to), the ballot card is pulled past
the printhead into the ballot box, and the printhead (under control of
hacked software) can print in a vote for Candidate Smith. Few voters will be
worried that the line is blank rather than filled in with NO SELECTION MADE.

You might think, ``OK, the ExpressVote XL can fill in undervotes, that's
bad, but it can't change votes.''  But it can! Here is the mechanism:
Suppose the voter makes choices in all 15 contests, and chooses Jones for
State Senator. The hacked software can print a ballot card with only 14
contests, and leave blank spaces for State Senator. Then, after the voter
reviews the ballot card behind glass, the card moves past the printhead into
the ballot box. At this time the hacked software can print the hacker's
choice (Smith) for State Senator. If most humans were really good at
checking their printout line-by-line with what they marked on the
touchscreen, this wouldn't succeed because the voter would notice the
missing line, but voters are only human.

Subject: How Amazon Sidewalk Works -- and Why You May Want to Turn It Off
  (WiReD)

The white paper points out the steps that Amazon has taken to make this as
private and secure as possible, including a variety of cryptographic
algorithms and those three levels of encryption: It shouldn't be possible
for other people to spy on your network or suddenly gain access to your
smart thermostat. Everything should happen seamlessly behind the scenes, in
theory.

All that said, it really comes down to how much you trust Amazon -- the
company that seems keen to collect as much data as possible about you,
shares Ring camera information with law enforcement agencies, and which
hasn't always protected sensitive user data quite as robustly as it might
have done. The company has also said it might share Sidewalk data with
third-party developers further down the line, and you know where that kind
of data sharing tends to lead.

If you end up deciding that Amazon Sidewalk isn't for you, you need to take
action: It's on by default, once the software update has hit your devices
(it's also on by default for users setting up an Amazon-powered smart home
for the first time.) If you want to turn it off, you need to open up the
Alexa app on your phone, and go to More, Settings, Account Settings, and
Amazon Sidewalk.

Subject: What to expect for the 2021 workplace (WashPost)

Video chats will get smarter -- and, potentially, creepier -- thanks to
artificial intelligence.

If 2020 was the year video conferencing truly went mainstream, 2021 could be
the year it gets smarter. Some of the largest platforms will begin using
artificial intelligence to recognize and track certain gestures participants
make, automate to-do items and help manage the challenges of workers split
between work and home.

Zoom Video Communications, for instance, announced a *smart gallery* feature
it plans to roll out in June 2021 that will use cameras to make multiple
people in the same on-site conference room appear as separate, equal-sized
windows on their live-stream video. Those working from home will see the
individual faces of each colleague rather than just a view of the whole
conference room, an effort to visually shrink the differences between remote
and in-person workers.

``We want to maintain the democratization of Zoom, and have everyone on
the same level when people come back to the office,'' said Oded Gal, Zoom's
chief product officer.

Cisco Systems, meanwhile, will launch *gesture recognition* early next year
using artificial intelligence to recognize specific movements -- clapping,
raised hands, a thumbs up, or thumbs down. For large virtual meetings with
hundreds of attendees, it could help gauge reactions to an idea without
requiring attendees to answer a survey or click on-screen emoji.

Asked if recognizing facial expressions like smiles, frowns or eye rolls in
a video call might be next, Cisco Senior Vice President Jeetu Patel said
addressing privacy concerns has to come first. Even collecting anonymous
data might make people uneasy, he said.  ``This is much more of a privacy
and comfort issue than it is a technology issue.  It's just a matter of what
is going to be acceptable.''

Microsoft Teams, meanwhile, added a new feature late this year that uses AI
to recognize what tasks participants agreed to complete during a meeting and
send them reminders afterward, as well as create searchable meeting
transcripts.

``It will follow up with me with *action items* that I agreed to,'' Jared
Spataro, corporate vice president for Microsoft 365, said in an interview.
``A lot of things that people are thinking `Yeah, someday that will be
reality' are actually already in the product.'' Microsoft has also filed a
patent for a system that could use sensors, cameras and software to examine
body language, expressions and participant contributions to come up with an
*overall quality score* for how the meeting went. But Spataro said,
``Neither research nor patents is a good predictor of product pipeline.
We're always looking at all those types of things.''

https://techxplore.com/news/2021-01-ai-algorithm-accurate-person-political.html

"A team of researchers at Stanford University has developed an AI algorithm
that proved to be slightly over 70% accurate at guessing a person's
political affiliation after studying a single photograph. In their paper
published in the journal Scientific Reports, the group describes building
and testing their algorithm and how well it worked."

See "Facial recognition technology can expose political orientation from
naturalistic facial images," for a detailed discussion of image
classification and algorithm operation.
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79310-1

"The researchers were not able to pin down exactly what sorts of facial
characteristics their system correlated with political affiliation, but they
did find some trends -- head orientation and emotional expression, for
example, appeared to provide some clues."

Political profiling based on facial recognition can guide campaign
advertising, appeals for donations, personnel recruiting, etc. Given a
polarized electorate, the algorithm might assist identification of
persuadable voters to tip a close election.

Correlate this algorithm's predictive capabilities with an interpretation of
the brain's amygdala, as explored by political neuroscientists [1] using
fMRI to estimate political inclinations, to yield artificially intelligent
phrenology.

on the short term aging phenomena in transistors.

It will focus on this physical phenomenon of short-term aging as a route to

Trojan detection has been demonstrated through simulations on integrated
circuits (ICs) with several types of hardware Trojans through stochastic
perturbations injected into the simulation studies. This DURIP project seeks

https://phys.org/news/2021-01-unique-incorporates-fluid-dynamics-future.html

"Rice University engineers hope to make life better for those with
replacement joints by modeling how artificial hips are likely to rub them
the wrong way."

Knee, hip, and shoulder replacements are performed routinely, especially for
an aging population. Arthroplasty is the medical procedure orthopedic
surgeons apply for joint replacement.

"Rates of Total Joint Replacement in the United States: Future Projections
to 2020--2040 Using the National Inpatient Sample"
https://www.jrheum.org/content/early/2019/04/09/jrheum.170990 estimates 498K
total hip arthroplasty and 1.06M total knee arthroplasty procedures in 2020
within the US. The essay projects a 2-3X multiplier for each by 2040.

The FDA's product classification website (type in 'knee' or 'hip' to see an
extended list)
(https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPCD/PCDSimpleSearch.cfm,

A culled list (filtered for implants -- partial and total -- and inspected
to possess non-null TPLC medical device report records) reveals 24 separate
product codes for hip replacements and 20 for knee replacements. Each
product code represents manufactured devices consisting of various plastics,
metals, or a combination of these materials.

Given the product code count above, and the Patient Problem counts given
below, an estimate of diminished quality of life from hip arthroplasty can
be calculated assuming there's at least 1 manufactured product per product
code.

1085 * 24 = 47740 patient problems/5 years = 9548 patient problems per year
or 9,548/498,000 = ~2% of all arthroplasty procedures in 2020 are estimated
to experience post-operative negative quality of life impact: infection,
pain, dislocations, etc. A similar method can be applied to estimate knee
replacement quality of life impacts.

Given the implantation growth rate projection, this number is likely to
double or triple by 2040 without significant improvements in prosthetic
device and patient arthroplasty treatment life cycles.

Subject: Risk Management and Two-Dose Vaccines

Now that vaccines have started to roll out, we have a new risk management
lesson from them.  Most of the vaccines that have been approved so far are
two-dose vaccines.  With the rush to get vaccines into people in the most
expeditious manner, there is now a new controversy.  Do you give as many
people as possible one dose of the vaccine, or do you hold back doses so
that there will be a guaranteed supply for those who need a second shot?

First, let's look at the mechanics of what is going on with the two-dose
vaccines.  (There are some one dose vaccines coming, but they seem to be at
least a month away from approval, so we've got some time to discuss this.)
The first shot, in a two-dose series, is often referred to as a primer shot.
It is delivering some material to the body to alert the immune system to
something it should be paying attention to.  Most often this is some kind of
protein that is foreign to the human body.  The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines
are kind of interesting in that they contain messenger RNA (mRNA) that makes
our bodies produce the protein spikes that are on the coronavirus.  Having
produced these proteins (without ever having encountered the actual virus),
our bodies then produce antibodies that identify and attack these proteins.
The idea is that, by the time we actually encounter some coronavirus, our
bodies are primed and ready to attack the actual virus.  (Given the trials
that have gone on, and the data collected, the idea seems to be correct.)

With many two-dose vaccines, the second dose, sometimes known as a booster
shot, as opposed to the initial primer shot, is often just more of the same.
(Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are of this type.)  In past studies of
vaccines, it seems to be that, in the case of many vaccines, a second shot
of the same material does two things.  The first is that it increases the
protective effectiveness of the vaccine, by boosting the immune response
that we produce.  The second is that it increases the duration over time
that the body is able to produce this response, thus conferring protection
over a longer period.  For example, after a single shot the body may produce
an effective immune response for a period of four months.  After a second
shot, that might be increased to two years.  (At this point we don't have
good data about duration in regard to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, since
they haven't existed for more than a few months, but we assume they will
follow a similar pattern.)

The increase in duration is, of course, a benefit.  But, in the midst of a
pandemic, and particularly in the midst of huge second and third wave
surges, it is the increase in effectiveness that sets up the possible
controversy.  Do you leave some people only partly protected, so that you
can partly protect others?

Since this is risk management, we again have to note probabilities and
uncertainties and the fact that none of this is quantum.  Protection isn't
absolute, and it doesn't turn on and off.  In particular, protection doesn't
turn on instantly, and takes time to develop.  And it also takes time to go
away again.

In a two-dose vaccine regime, you receive an initial primer shot.  That does
not mean you can now safely go to bars and insurrection mobs without being
at risk of getting CoVID-19.  It will take some time for your body to
develop any kind of immune response.  After three weeks or so, you may have
about 80% protection.  Note that this isn't 100% protection.  You can still
get infected if you encounter someone who is infectious.  But you are less
likely to become infected.

(Actually, even though it might sound low, 80% is pretty good for a vaccine.
The flu vaccines that we get every year are only about 50% effective.  That,
and the effects of herd immunity when almost everyone gets the vaccine,
means far fewer cases of the flu, and fewer deaths, and less time lost to
sickness, and less impact on the economy, and so even a 50% effective
vaccine is a very good thing.)

At this point, two things may be happening.  Your body may (and probably is)
still increasing itís protection, even without any further intervention.
Some of the Pfizer and Moderna data indicates that, over a longer period of
time, even a single dose of the vaccine can confer protection over 90%.  But
you can, at this point, get the second, booster, dose of the vaccine.
Following the booster dose, after some time (possibly a week, possibly six
weeks), your protection level can rise to around 95%.

A couple more points to note.  I said ìat this point.î Vaccine studies
in the past have clearly shown that, if you give the booster shot too early,
it is basically a waste of vaccine.  There is a minimum time, after the
primer shot, before a booster shot gives any booster effect.  This minimum
time seems to be three weeks, in the case of Pfizer, and four weeks, in the
case of Moderna.

Another factor to consider is that, while there is a definite minimum time
period between shots in terms of maximum effect, the maximum time between
shots is much more open ended.  If the minimum time is three weeks, then
there is no diminution of effect if you wait until four weeks to give the
booster.  In fact, many studies seem to indicate that, to a certain extent,
the longer you wait for the second, booster, shot, the stronger the
protection and the longer the duration of protection.  (Again, the
coronavirus vaccines simply haven't been in existence long enough for us to
have really good data on the timing, but studies or existing vaccines show
that this is very likely.)

Yet another consideration goes back to those numbers.  You will recall that
I said 80% was pretty good protection.  It is.  90% is better, and 95% is
better still.  But even 95% isn't that much better than 80%, and 80% is a
whole lot better than nothing.

So, back to the controversy.  When we start giving vaccines, we can stick
with the minimum time regime, and give everyone a second dose as soon as
they hit the three week mark.  That way we get more people up to 95%
protection sooner.

Or, we can delay the second dose out to five weeks.  The downside is that
those people spend an extra two weeks at 80% protection before they get the
booster dose.  But, during those two weeks, we can start bringing even more
people to 80% protection (rather than leaving them with nothing).  Which
means we start building herd immunity faster.  And the early lot are not,
after all, being left with no protection.  They are probably at 80%, and may
be building, themselves, towards 90%.  And they are still well within the
time period during which they are going to get the booster effect.  They may
even get a better booster effect for the delay.

The calculus involved here is complex.  It involves the infectiousness of
the virus, the effectiveness of the vaccine, the total numbers of cases, and
a number of other considerations.  However, in our situation, the answer
seems to fall on the *delay* side of the equation.

Subject: Different kinds of security

For years, no, actually decades, I have read, with pleasure and reliance, a
certain columnist's columns on politics in BC.  He has been knowledgeable,
analytical, and educational.  Due to his taking on a field outside his
expertise in 2020, that of the pandemic, I am rapidly losing any and all of
the respect that I ever had for his journalistic abilities.

https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/vaughn-palmer-dix-ducks-and-
covers-before-fessing-up-on-care-home-covid-outbreaks

His latest column chides Health Minister Adrian Dix for being careful in his
answer about a question involving the rise of infections in long term care
homes.  Yes, Dix might have answered earlier and more directly that staff is
responsible for most outbreaks in long term care.  But that is a loaded
question right now.  Staff are responsible for outbreaks because they are
the ones moving between the community and the homes.  What do you want to do
about that?  Ban the staff?  Leave the homes unattended, and let the
residents shift as best they can from their beds?

But the columnist isn't content to raise that nonsensical issue.  He then
goes on to blame the "second wave" surge on the election.  Anyone who takes
the time to look at the case numbers can see that the election made almost
no contribution to the surge, which clearly dates from Thanksgiving dinners
and parties.

The columnist then takes up the cudgel on behalf of the idea of "routine"
testing for staff.  As he has been told many times when he raises the (same)
question on "The Dr. Bonnie Show (co-starring Adrian Dix and Nigel Howard),"
there *is* routine testing of medical staff.  It's just that the routine
varies depending upon the level of medical and public health risk, and not
at the call of some political columnist.

Testing of every staff member twice a week would still leave at least a four
day window every week during which people could become infected and
infectious.  In fact the window would be longer, since test results take
about 24 to 48 hours to be processed.  And who is it that would do these
tests (by the way, how many LTC staff are there in the entire province of
BC?), and what work would *not* be done while they are doing them?  Risk
management is obviously not the columnist's field.

It may just be CoVID fatigue and increased irritability on my part, but I am
growing distressed with the poor quality of the Sun's coverage of the
pandemic, and it's seeming pursuit of the scandalous over the informative.
And so I fired off this rant to some of my friends in security.

And got a response back:

> Did you send this to the wrong mailing list?

So, I definitely did not make the point I wanted to make properly.  I
suppose a bit more detail (and a bit less rant) is in order.

Lemme start with a seminar I did some time back.  Unusually, it was actually
in Vancouver.  I had two candidates, sitting next to each other, as it
happened, who both worked for government, but came from radically divergent
security situations, as became obvious when we discussed the good old CIA
triad of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

One worked for E-Comm.  These are the people who, among other things, answer
the phones when you call 911.  The E-Comm people don't exactly broadcast
their calls, but confidentiality is not their first concern.  That's
availability.  When somebody in trouble calls 911, somebody *has* to answer
the phone.  (I had a tour through E-Comm one time, and their business
continuity and resilience planning is *really* impressive.)

Sitting beside him was a candidate from one of the business development
banks of the federal government.  These agencies provide loans to businesses
that want to expand their business.  Since the idea is expansion, most of
the loans aren't exactly secured by traditional equity.  In order to ensure
that the money (mostly) goes to actually building business, the companies
have to provide masses of information about themselves, their markets, and
their plans.  This data is *highly* confidential: if it ever got into the
hands of their competitors, the companies could be in real trouble.  So
everything is kept strictly confidential, and almost all their security is
directed that way.  But availability?  As he said himself, "Hey, we're the
federal government.  If we disappeared for a month, who would even notice?"

I guess what the columnist doesn't see (and what I didn't really allow for),
is that he has worked for decades in politics.  Politics is definitely a
long game.  It doesn't really happen all that fast.  It's important to have
a really good memory, going back decades.  You need to analyse.  And you've
got all the time in the world to analyse, because nothing is going to happen
very quickly.  You need to look, in minute detail, at what the government,
and political figures, are doing, while they are doing it, to point out
minor flaws so that, by the time an act *is* passed, it's perfect.  (It
never actually *is* perfect, but that's what you are aiming for.)

But a pandemic isn't politics, even though a lot of political work is
involved.  A pandemic is emergency management.  You have to do *something*,
because, if you don't, people will die.  And, often, anything you do is
better than doing nothing, because if you do nothing, people will die.  So,
delaying things while you look for a perfect solution is wrong, because, in
emergency management, "the best" is very definitely the enemy of the good.
Pandemics are fluid, and you make the best choice you can, at the time, with
limited information, and change plans when the information changes, and
hope, rather desperately, that the first plans you made don't run completely
counter to later information.  But you make a choice, and do it, because, if
you don't, people will die.

In emergency management, you do try to get divergent opinions, to try and
make sure that you don't make a drastic mistake.  But the very last thing
you need, in the middle of a pandemic or other disaster, is someone publicly
second-guessing what you are doing.  That can wait for the "after action"
debriefings.  During the crisis, having some political columnist (with no
training in emergency management, or even risk management) saying that you
are making a mistake is just messing with the messaging you are trying to
get out to the public.  And, if that happens, people might die.

There are different types of security.  They are useful in different types
of situations.  There is no "one size fits all."  We need to apply the right
security to the right situation.  And we definitely don't want to apply the
wrong security to the wrong situation.

Subject: Re: Scope of Russian Hacking Far Exceeds Initial Fears (RISKS-32.44)

I am getting very tired of reading stories like this. I worked IT security
for many years in Government (now retired) expending much effort to stop
this kind of activity. One of the reasons I retired early was the lack of
will to really do anything about this type of activity.¬† If the
Russians or the Chinese or anyone else, for that matter, flew over and
dropped troops into our major centers with orders to break into key
Government and commercial buildings, sabotage critical infrastructure, and
steal sensitive information and other valuables, we would immediately
retaliate in an appropriate manner that would discourage future similar
activities.  Doing it electronically is the same as doing it the old
fashioned way (analog). Why isn't anyone dealing with it as such? As far as
I know, there has been no retaliation for the numerous intrusions that have
occurred over the years. Why are we still letting them get away with
it?¬† Unless we treat this like an electronic war and appropriately
defend ourselves with a good offence, they will keep doing it with
impunity.¬† If you are going to do nothing then you might as well
throw open the doors and let them in (i.e. surrender).  At the very least,
take control of or destroy their access to the Internet so they can't access
their targets.<br> <br> Maybe it's a good thing that I am retired. My
frustration and bitterness at doing so much over the years with so little
effect is beginning to show through.¬† I can see from this and other
similar posts that my peers are having very little success in dealing with
the many crooks and enemies conducting these intrusions. Were I still
working, I would be even more frustrated than I am reading about
it. Continue to do nothing and they'll reap your reward.

I ran one of these pilots in 2007, the one in Swindon.

It is illegal for the voting authority to issue any kind of binding proof of
your vote that you could use to trade, sell or demonstrate your voting
choices to a third party.  The challenge is to show you something convincing
that is not your vote, but which also can be independently verified.

One of the best that has been achieved to date and not torn to shreds (so to
speak) -- for which I was the project manager -- is vVote (2014) due to
Teague, Schneider, Culnane, Hook and Ryan, and this is a supervised polling
place system based on Pret a Voter.  I am not aware of a remote votingscheme in the world used or proposed for high stakes public elections that
has withstood even a fairly brief spotlight by the voting security
community.

We "wait" until total monthly deaths from all causes decrease to <= 1
standard deviation from normal.

The benefit is this calculation is easy to make from readily available civil
data collection processes which have been in place for a long time, doesn't
require any special testing, and can't really be manipulated.

For my Smith County, Texas, USA, mortality is currently at 7.351 standard
deviations.

Thanks, but I'm not sure if it's that simple.  Reportedly, what panics
politicians is people dying from Covid-19 in hospital corridors or parking
lots, so much routine health treatment has virtually stopped to leave room
for these people.  "Total monthly deaths from all causes" will include those
who may have died from delayed investigation and/or treatment but it's
difficult to say how many there were, and people who die quietly at home
aren't so conspicuous.  We are deluged with figures on daily/weekly/monthly
deaths, but often measured in different ways or time periods, and then
there's the annual panic over 'winter'.  There are constant demands over
making lockdown restrictions stricter, or if this would make things better
or worse...

  Hope that helped but it probably didn't.  CD

Clarification: I didn't mean that we stay locked down until then.¬†
Rather, the public health emergency will be over then. That the metric
measures all deaths, not just explicitly COVID-19 is an intentional feature,
not a bug.
