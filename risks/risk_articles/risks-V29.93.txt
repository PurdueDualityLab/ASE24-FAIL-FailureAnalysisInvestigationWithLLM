  "We are killing people," Martin says. "We did not get into this business
  to kill people. And this is only getting worse."  He pointed out that
  "there are hints" that developers will increasingly face some real heat in
  the years to come. He cited Volkswagen America's CEO, Michael Horn, who at
  first blamed software engineers for the company's emissions cheating
  scandal during a Congressional hearing, claimed the coders had acted on
  their own "for whatever reason." Horn later resigned after US prosecutors
  accused the company of making this decision at the highest levels and then
  trying to cover it up.  But Martin pointed out, "The weird thing is, it
  was software developers who wrote that code. It was us. Some programmers
  wrote cheating code.  Do you think they knew? I think they probably knew."

Subject: IMSI Catcher Report Calls for Transparency, Proportionality, and
  Minimization Policies (CitizenLab)

https://citizenlab.org/2016/09/imsi-catcher-report-calls-transparency-proportionality-minimization-policies/

Christopher Parsons, 13 Sep 2016
<https://citizenlab.org/category/author/christopher-parsons/>
Tamir Israel <https://cippic.ca/about-us#staff>

The Citizen Lab and CIPPIC are releasing a report, *Gone Opaque? An Analysis
of Hypothetical IMSI Catcher Overuse in Canada*, which examines the use of
devices that are commonly referred to as cell site simulators, IMSI
Catchers, Digital Analyzers, or Mobile Device Identifiers, and under brand
names such as Stingray, DRTBOX, and Hailstorm.  IMSI Catchers are a class of
of surveillance devices used by Canadian state agencies. They enable state
agencies to intercept communications from mobile devices and are principally
used to identify otherwise anonymous individuals associated with a mobile
device and track them.

Though these devices are not new, the ubiquity of contemporary mobile
devices, coupled with the decreasing costs of IMSI Catchers themselves, has
led to an increase in the frequency and scope of these devices' use. Their
intrusive nature, as combined with surreptitious and uncontrolled uses,
pose an insidious threat to privacy.

This report investigates the surveillance capabilities of IMSI Catchers,
efforts by states to prevent information relating to IMSI Catchers from
entering the public record, and the legal and policy frameworks that govern
the use of these devices. The report principally focuses on Canadian
agencies but, to do so, draws comparative examples from other jurisdictions.
The report concludes with a series of recommended transparency and control
mechanisms that are designed to properly contain the use of the devices and
temper their more intrusive features.

The report is structured across four sections:

 - Section One provides an overview of the technical capabilities of IMSI
   Catchers.
 - Section Two focuses on civil society and journalists' efforts to
   render transparent how IMSI Catchers are used.
 - Section Three examines the regulation of IMSI Catchers and avenues
   towards lawful regulation of their use.
 - Section Four sets out best practices that should be incorporated into
   a framework governing IMSI Catcher use.

Key Findings

 - In this report we track a malware operation targeting members of the
   Tibetan Parliament over August and October 2016.
 - The operation uses known and patched exploits to deliver a custom
   backdoor known as KeyBoy.
 - We analyze multiple versions of KeyBoy revealing a development cycle
   focused on avoiding basic antivirus detection.
 - This operation is another example of a threat actor using *just
   enough* technical sophistication to exploit a target.

commercial spyware.

*Updated (Sept 1, 2016)*: Today Apple released security updates

These updates patch the Trident vulnerabilities that identified in this
report for desktop users.  The Trident vulnerabilities used by NSO could
have been weaponized against users of non iOS devices, including OSX.

Subject: Kryptowire discovers mobile phone firmware that transmitted PII

15 Nov 2016
Kryptowire discovers mobile phone firmware that transmitted personally
identifiable information (PII) without user consent or disclosure
http://www.kryptowire.com/adups_security_analysis.html

  Kryptowire has identified several models of Android mobile devices that
  contained firmware that collected sensitive personal data about their
  users and transmitted this sensitive data to third-party servers without
  disclosure or the users' consent. These devices were available through
  major US-based online retailers (Amazon, BestBuy, for example) and
  included popular smartphones such as the BLU R1 HD. These devices actively
  transmitted user and device information including the full-body of text
  messages, contact lists, call history with full telephone numbers, unique
  device identifiers including the International Mobile Subscriber Identity
  (IMSI) and the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI). The
  firmware could target specific users and text messages matching remotely
  defined keywords. The firmware also collected and transmitted information
  about the use of applications installed on the monitored device, bypassed
  the Android permission model, executed remote commands with escalated
  (system) privileges, and was able to remotely reprogram the devices.

  The firmware that shipped with the mobile devices and subsequent updates
  allowed for the remote installation of applications without the users'
  consent and, in some versions of the software, the transmission of
  fine-grained device location information. The core of the monitoring
  activities took place using a commercial Firmware Over The Air (FOTA)
  update software system that was shipped with the Android devices we tested
  and were managed by a company named Shanghai Adups Technology Co. Ltd.

From: Toby Douglass <toby_public@winterflaw.net>
Subject: Risks to toilets in computing systems

Thin supply chains are efficient but potentially fragile, as they in their
efficiency lack redundancy or immediately available spare capacity.

In Berlin, there is found a chain of large, low-cost gyms by the name of
McFit.  This gym chain owns a subsidiary brand, High5, composed of smaller,
more highly branded gyms.  The gyms are largely automatic, with minimal
staff counts - typically one staff member, two at busy times, with perhaps
two hundred people in the gym.  Access to the gym, the lockers and even the
vending machines is by key-card.

McFit offers a minimum membership of one year.  High5 offers a monthly
subscription, and with an option to be able to attend McFit gyms.  As such,
it is not uncommon for people to join High5 and then attend only a McFit
gym.

This leads to the question of the integration of the computer systems at
these two chains, such that the High5 card can function at the McFit gyms.

For the last three weeks, the High5 cards have not functioned in McFit gyms,
either to access the gym, or to open and close lockers.  The High5 web-site
itself no longer allows users to log into their accounts; clicking on the
"login" button leads - without explanation, and so confusingly - to the
"join now" page.  In theory it is possible to log in *at* the High5 gyms,
but it turns out that if the account in question lacks a photo, attempting
to login silently disables the account, and so it is then no longer possible
to log in even at the gym.  (I have been looking to do so to change the IBAN
used to pay for my account.)

When a High5 member now attends a McFit gym, they must wait for assistance,
which typically takes five to ten minutes.  The gym has a small supply of
unallocated McFit access cards to allow for locker use in such cases.  It
has become increasingly common for High5 members to take such a card but not
return it, and then on their next visit, simply to edge past the access
turnstile (there is room to do so), so that they need not suffer the onerous
wait for assistance.  As such, the supply of locker cards is running low.

Where the demands upon staff time have now significantly risen, routine
maintenance - emptying bins, cleaning the toilets, etc - has suffered.
During peak times, the bins begin to overflow and the toilets and urinals,
not the least fragrant even in the best of times, stink.

(As an aside, as far as I am aware, there has been no communication from
High5 or McFit to their customers regarding these matters; the web-site is
silent in these matters and there has been no email.)

When conducting failure analysis, the correct approach is to follow the
chain of failure as far as possible, to find the *earliest* point at which
corrective action could have been taken.

With this in mind, I must first note that all of this would have been
avoided had McFit offered the same pricing plans as High5; people would have
joined McFit directly.

Beyond this, I must look past the computing problems so described, and
observe that although I live in central Berlin, this McFit is the only fully
equipped (weights, machines, cardio machines, etc) gym within 20 minutes
walking distance of home.

I would as you can imagine by now have changed gym - if I could; however, I
find if I must take the metro to get to the gym, my attendance falls off
dramatically.

These computer problems, from my point of view, would be solved by the
presence of alternative gyms - safety in variety of supply, as Churchill
remarked upon the switch by the Royal Navy from coal to oil.

Given the large population here, I must think that there are unusual factors
which are strongly discouraging the supply of gymnasiums.  I would be
interested to have some understanding of those factors, as fixing them would
in effect fix these problems further down the chain of failure.

My gut feeling is that this may related to Risks to the Public from
Government and Related Systems.

Motherboard, 17 Nov 2016

Hackers say they have stolen a wealth of company and personal information
from US adhesive, glue, and tape company Gorilla Glue. The hackers have
previously tried to extort medical organizations by demanding a sizable
ransom payment in exchange for not releasing hacked data publicly.

“We have everything they ever created,” someone from the hacking group
The Dark Overlord told Motherboard in an online chat.

The hackers claim to have over 500GB of research and development materials,
including intellectual property and product designs, and access to Dropbox
and personal email accounts related to the family-run Gorilla Glue.
