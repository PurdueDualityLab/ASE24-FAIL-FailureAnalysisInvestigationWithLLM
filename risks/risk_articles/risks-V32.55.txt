Subject: What happens when an unstoppable force hits an immovable object?
  (Justin Bariso)

In a recent speech in Brussels marking International Data Privacy Day, Apple
CEO Tim Cook went on the offensive against Mark Zuckerberg and
Facebook. Cook's speech seems to be a direct response to Facebook's recent
attack on Apple, in which the world's largest social network took out
full-page ads in several newspapers attacking Apple's new privacy changes.

But what's most fascinating is that Cook took direct aim at Facebook without
ever mentioning the company by name.

Just check out the following excerpt:

"Technology does not need vast troves of personal data stitched together
across dozens of websites and apps in order to succeed. Advertising existed
and thrived for decades without it, and we're here today because the path of
least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom.

"If a business is built on misleading users on data exploitation, on choices
that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves
reform.

"We should not look away from the bigger picture. In a moment of rampant
disinformation and conspiracy theories juiced by algorithms, we can no
longer turn a blind eye to a theory of technology that says all engagement
is good engagement, the longer the better, and all with the goal of
collecting as much data as possible.

"Too many are still asking the question 'How much can we get away with?'
when they need to be asking 'What are the consequences?'

"What are the consequences of prioritizing conspiracy theories and violent
incitement simply because of the high rates of engagement?

"What are the consequences of not just tolerating but rewarding content that
undermines public trust in life-saving vaccinations?

"What are the consequences of seeing thousands of users joining extremist
groups and then perpetuating an algorithm that recommends even more?  It is
long past time to stop pretending that this approach doesn't come with a
cost. A polarization of lost trust, and yes, of violence.  A social dilemma
cannot be allowed to become a social catastrophe."

The fact that Cook doesn't name Facebook somehow increases its impact.
Because as you hear Cook's 's speech, you can't help but immediately think
of the house that Zuckerberg built.

If you're wondering how Apple and Facebook ended up at odds, you can read
more of the details here. But the reality is these two tech giants have been
heading toward a major conflict for quite some time.

The problem is that Apple's and Facebook's business philosophies are
diametrically opposed to each other.

Apple is a lifestyle brand. And part of the lifestyle Apple sells is users
having more control over their privacy.

Facebook, on the other hand, is in the data business. The more data it
collects on users, the more effectively it can sell targeted ads.

But collecting and selling all that data comes at great cost, as Cook
highlights. "The end result of all of this is that you are no longer the
customer," said Cook. "You are the product."

Cook went on to further highlight the differences in Apple's and Facebook's
philosophies, in no uncertain terms.

"We believe that ethical technology is technology that works for you," said
Cook. "It's technology that helps you sleep, not keeps you up. It tells you
when you've had enough. It gives you space to create or draw or write or
learn, not refresh just one more time."

At first glimpse, it might appear that Apple and Facebook are on diverging
paths. But in reality, they're on a collision course.

So, what does happen when an unstoppable force hits an immovable object?

One of them gets destroyed.

The takeaway

There are major lessons here for entrepreneurs and business owners.

As Cook aptly points out, "advertising existed and thrived for decades"
without using data that was collected in less than transparent ways. And as
customers are offered more choice when it comes to how apps and websites
track their data, experts predict that more and more people will opt out of
said tracking.

If you're an advertiser, you'll need to adapt. Or die.  [...]

Subject: Everything You Need to Know About Evolving Threat of Ransomware
  (The Hacker News)

The cybersecurity world is constantly evolving to new forms of threats and
vulnerabilities. But ransomware proves to be a different animal -- most
destructive, persistent, notoriously challenging to prevent, and is showing
no signs of slowing down.

Falling victim to a ransomware attack can cause significant data loss, data
breach, operational downtime, costly recovery, legal consequences, and
reputational damage.

In this story, we have covered everything you need to know about ransomware
and how it works.  What is ransomware?

Ransomware is a malicious program that gains control over the infected
device, encrypts files, and blocks user access to the data or a system until
a sum of money, or ransom, is paid.

Crooks' scheme includes a ransom note -- with amount and instructions on how
to pay a ransom in return for the decryption key -- or direct communication
with the victim.

While ransomware impacts businesses and institutions of every size and type,
attackers often target healthcare, education, IT, government, and finance
sectors with deeper pockets -- causing damages ranging from hundreds of
millions to billions of dollars.

Ransomware attacks started picking up in 2012, and since then, it has become
the most pervasive cyber-attacks across the world.

For instance, HelloKitty ransomware hit Polish video game developer CD
Projekt Red last week with quite a popular tactic, i.e., attackers
threatened the company to leak the source code of games, including Cyberpunk
2077, Witcher 3, Gwent, and along with confidential files in the company.

And it's actually happened! After CD Projekt announced that they would not
be paying the ransom, attackers created an auction for the stolen data on a
hacker forum.

And it isn't the only example. Ransomware has always been one of the most
popular kinds of malicious samples uploaded in malware analysis sandbox
ANY.RUN <https://any.run/>. Over 124,00 interactive sessions with ransomware
were analyzed online only in 2020.  >From a locker to the enterprise.  [...]

Subject: Telecommunications plans to block Google Voice Messaging
  (Android Police)

https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/09/google-voice-wont-forward-text-messages-to-outside-numbers-much-longer/

The telecommunications providers will soon stop forwarding Google Voice text
messages. While one can argue that such messages have become a spam problem,
the carriers are in a special position as gatekeepers. We must have the
option of bypassing their policies, especially when their solution happens
to conveniently protect their legacy business model. It is particularly
dangerous for those who rely on a portable messaging number that will reach
us on any device in an emergency.

It's a reminder of the problem with a system based on perimeter security. 5G (https://rmf.vc/IEEE5GPast) is another facet of clawing control and value back into the network based on the idea the TPC (The Phone Company) knows best.

Subject: A Hacker Got All My Texts for $16 (Vice)

*A gaping flaw in SMS lets hackers take over phone numbers in minutes by
simply paying a company to reroute text messages.*

I didn't expect it to be that quick. While I was on a Google Hangouts call
with a colleague, the hacker sent me screenshots of my Bumble and Postmates
accounts, which he had broken into. Then he showed he had received texts
that were meant for me that he had intercepted. Later he took over my
WhatsApp account, too, and texted a friend pretending to be me.

Looking down at my phone, there was no sign it had been hacked. I still had
reception; the phone said I was still connected to the T-Mobile network.
Nothing was unusual there. But the hacker had swiftly, stealthily, and
largely effortlessly redirected my text messages to themselves. And all for
just $16.

I hadn't been SIM swapped, where hackers trick or bribe telecom employees to
port a target's phone number to their own SIM card. Instead, the hacker used
a service by a company called Sakari, which helps businesses do SMS
marketing and mass messaging, to reroute my messages to him. This overlooked
attack vector shows not only how unregulated commercial SMS tools are but
also how there are gaping holes in our telecommunications infrastructure,
with a hacker sometimes just having to pinky swear they have the consent of
the target.

"Welcome to create an account if you want to mess with it, literally anyone
can sign up," Lucky225, the pseudonymous hacker who carried out the attack,
told Motherboard, describing how easy it is to gain access to the tools
necessary to seize phone numbers.  [...]

  [Li Gong also noted this article, and commented:
    "If a re-direct can be accomplished so easily, it is a miracle that not
    many more hacks have happened."

Subject: It's time to stop using SMS for anything (Vice)

  [Some duplication with the previous item.  PGN]

By now most infosec professionals are aware of various ways SMS text
messaging can be hijacked. For example so-called *SIM Swap* attacks, SS7
attacks, Port-out fraud, etc.  All of these attacks however do require some
level of sophistication, whether it be high level access to SS7, or account
information or social engineering to successfully port out the phone number
to a new provider or swap the sim on the existing account.
<https://www.vice.com/en/article/a37epb/t-mobile-alert-victims-sim-card-hack>

<https://www.vice.com/en/article/mg7bd4/how-a-hacker-can-take-over-your-life-by-hijacking-your-phone-number>

There [are] however other vulnerabilities that are not particularly well
known. For VoIP numbers in particular, which may be assigned to a CLEC or
VoIP wholesaler, the SMS may need to be routed to a different carrier than
the carrier of record. This is accomplished in two different ways. One is an
ALT SPID, which NPAC defines
<https://www.npac.com/resources/public-knowledgebase/glossary> as =9C= The
four-digit identifier of a *second service provider associated with a
telephone number *or thousand block. It identifies the wholesale service
provider customer to which the PSTN service provider has assigned the
number. The second service provider in turn may either assign the number to
its retail customer or to another service provider for its use.=9D AL= T
SPIDs are vulnerable and susceptible to change and can be used to hijack
SMS, but it too does require carrier-level access to make changes directly
to NPAC.  In particular, and importantly, it requires the current
provider's co-operation for the new carrier's ALT SPID to be added in
NPAC.

Which brings us to an alternative SMS routing provider, NetNumber
<https://www.netnumber.com/>. NetNumber has a product called NetNumber ID
(NNID), it's a 6-digit number similar to an ALT SPID that identifies the
carrier to route to for SMS. Net Number explains it in this 2019 Q&A

Subject: Spoiler Alert: Bits from Covid: Season 2

So, I finally got my 2nd vaccination shot exactly 1 year after the Covid
pandemic officially started (in the U.S.).  Hint: don't plan anything
important for the day after your 2nd shot!)

Unfortunately for the ~120 million people who got Covid, the ~2.7 million
people who died from Covid (including 534k deaths in the U.S., and 30k
deaths in NYC), the Covid-19 pandemic will NOT be a once in a century event,
because it has unleashed knowledge to the wider world that used to reside
only in epidemiologists' and science fiction writers' nightmares.

We in the computer science community know where this story goes next, and it
isn't pretty. We've seen computer viruses, hacks, and ransomware on a global
scale, and now have an entire branch of the U.S. armed forces dedicated to
fighting (and promulgating!) these types of attacks. "Cut-and-paste" actors
will convert every kind of cyber-attack into an analogous biological attack.

Plan on "Roundup"* attacks, where a country (or terrorist group or cynical
company) simultaneously develop a novel pandemic virus and its corresponding
vaccine; the country (or group) silently hides the vaccine among other
vaccination programs, and then either releases the virus into the wild, or
holds the world hostage with the threat of its release.

  (* Roundup attacks naturally occurring weeds, but not
  genetically-engineered -- and expensive -- "Roundup Ready" crops.)

Although the U.S. suffered ~100X the deaths of 911, including ~10X the
deaths in NYC alone, the U.S. is currently not yet even contemplating the
need to spend the $6T or so that it has spent fighting the "911 forever
wars" to fight future pandemics.

Yet we know future pandemics are coming, and soon, precisely *because* the
advanced world has shown itself vulnerable to these attacks, and the effect
on combat readiness, without even considering the effect on the economy as a
whole, would make the advanced world easy prey to a 21st Century
Hitler. Major countries could be convinced to give up without a single
shot(!), once an outbreak demonstrated the effectiveness of such a
weaponized virus.

Bill Gates sounded the alarm several years ago, but his alarm went unheeded;
he also underestimated the potential for mischief that is possible in Covid:
Season 2.

Covid: Season 2 will see a crash program involving trillions of dollars to
collapse the time for both *developing* and *distributing* a new vaccine
from a year to less than ONE WEEK. The world will need to develop an
*"electronic immune system"* which can quickly recognize (i.e., DNA/RNA
sequence) a novel virus, transmit this data to a widely distributed network
of miniature vaccination manufacturing machines located in every hospital,
doctor's office, drug store, etc., ready to instantly *synthesize* this new
vaccine for "shots in arms" within DAYS of the initial recognition.

Since there won't be time for 3-6 month FDA studies, these vaccines will
have to be tested on a gigantic network of living human cell cultures from a
substantial fraction of the population -- enough to guarantee that any new
vaccine won't cause more harm than it is intended to prevent.

Simultaneously with the development of the new vaccine(s), a similar set of
testing reagents will have to be developed, tested and distributed to a
similar network of miniature testing machines co-located in all of the same
facilities.

Such an effort may seem excessive, but the current Covid pandemic may soon
appear in retrospect to be merely a warm-up for a truly devastating pandemic
along the lines of the Black Death plague of 1348, which wiped out 30/50/70%
of the population of some cities. A truly "engineered" virus might achieve
such a catastrophic result.

The size of these numbers of deaths worldwide far exceeds those from any but
the largest meteorites, while the likely time frame is much, much
shorter. We need this immune response capability within the next 5-8 years,
as I imagine that the clock has already started ticking on the engineered
viruses of Covid: Season 2.

If the advanced world can coordinate to suppress nuclear weapons, would it
not be much easier and much more important to coordinate to suppress such a
global viral threat?

Each market frenzy seems crazier than the last. But all have the same roots.

SAN FRANCISCO -- This past week, a trading card featuring the quarterback
Tom Brady sold for a record $1.3 million. The total value of the
cryptocurrency Bitcoin hit $1 trillion. And Christieœôòùs sold a digital
artwork by an artist known as Beeple for $69.3 million after bids started at
just $100.

These seemingly singular events were all connected, part of a series of
manias that have gripped the financial world. For months, professional and
everyday investors have pushed up the prices of stocks and real estate. Now
the frenzy has spilled over into the riskiest œôòô and in some cases, wackiest
œôòô assets, including digital ephemera and media, cryptocurrencies,
collectibles like trading cards and even sneakers.

The surges have been driven by a unique set of conditions. Even as millions
were laid off in the pandemic, many peopleœôòùs bank accounts flourished, flush
from stimulus checks and government cash infusions into the economy. But
while people accumulated more money, traditional investments like stocks and

Subject: Amazon Dash Smart Shelf Review: The Future of Automatic Shopping
  (WiReD)

Amazon's Internet-connected scale automatically repurchases whatever you
stack on it when supplies get low. This is both neat and problematic.

Author writes:

I donœôòùt know what possessed me to buy an Amazon Dash Smart Shelf, but it
happened near the end of 2020, and 2020 was a very strange year. On November
25, I ordered the $20 auto-replenishment scale-large size, and by December 1
it had arrived. In a customer support email, Amazon urged me to get started
with the Smart Shelf, which is to say Amazon wanted me to get shopping.

The point of the Amazon Dash Smart Shelf is that you donœôòùt actually do the
shopping. Like all of Amazonœôòùs Dash products, which are linked to the
companyœôòùs Dash Replenishment Service (DRS for short), the shelf is supposed
to be smart enough to know when youœôòùre running low on whatever you might
find on Amazon. It senses when the load is getting too light and
automatically re-ups without you having to do anything. In October 2020,
after nearly a year of testing the Dash Smart Shelf with the help of small
and medium-sized businesses, Amazon made it available to all customers.

Behold, Amazonœôòùs vision for our interface-free future of shopping: You need
not even utter a sigh in the vicinity of an Alexa speaker or press a
garbage-bag-branded dongle. Your appliances just know. The Dash Shelf is
like an empty Amazon warehouse shelf, begging to be restocked; only in this
case, itœôòùs in your office. Or your home. Or your home office.

Oh, whatever could go wrong with this. Cleaner lifts everything on shelf to
dust it and a big truck arrives for you.

 evidence they help most diabetes patients (nbcnews.com)

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/diabetes/painless-glucose-monitors-are-popular-little-evidence-they-help-most-n1261013

"In the nation's battle against the diabetes epidemic, the go-to weapon
being aggressively promoted to patients is as small as a quarter and worn on
the belly or arm.

"A continuous glucose monitor holds a tiny sensor that's inserted just under
the skin, alleviating the need for patients to prick their fingers every day
to check blood sugar. The monitor tracks glucose levels all the time, sends
readings to patients' cellphone and doctor, and alerts patients when
readings are headed too high or too low.

"Nearly 2 million people with diabetes wear the monitors today, twice the
number in 2019, according to the investment firm Baird.

"There's little evidence continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) leads to better
outcomes for most people with diabetes -- the estimated 25 million
U.S. patients with Type 2 disease who don't inject insulin to regulate their
blood sugar, health experts say. Still, manufacturers, as well as some
physicians and insurers, say the devices help patients control their
diabetes by providing near-instant feedback to change diet and exercise
compared with once-a-day fingerstick tests. And they say that can reduce
costly complications of the disease, such as heart attacks and strokes."

I don't know where Baird acquired their estimate of devices in use.  That
number is not freely publicized by manufacturers or medical journals.

FDA's Total Product Life Cycle platform reveals numerous medical device
reports (MDRs).  Some 200,729 reports were filed, substantially by device
suppliers following up with healthcare suppliers.
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfTPLC/tplc.cfm?id=682&min_report_year=2016

The top-10 patient problems are shown in CSV format from JAN2016 through

Note the terms "No Consequence or Impact to Patient" and "No Known Impact or
Consequences To Patient." The labels attempt to discriminate malfunction
types. What's the difference? Subtle. To the patient, there is virtually no
distinction.

Contrast these two MDR reports for Malfunction:
1)
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/detail.cfm?mdrfoi__id=11301564&pc=QBJ
2)
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/detail.cfm?mdrfoi__id=11389200&pc=QBJ

The MDRs identify Malfunctions with proportionately few patient injuries as
shown in the Patient Problems CSV records. The patient's health care
provider consultation does require time, and money expenditure to reconcile
the CGM's inconsistent or non-deterministic output as traced to the Device
Problem records below.

Unless the insurance company completely covers the expense for physician
  encounter, the patient probably pays out-of-pocket expense. Insurance
  premiums are influenced as a result. The device supplier filing the MDR is
  not apparently concerned by this impact; the patient doesn't suffer
  physiologically.

Risk: Dependency on an unpredictable CGM comprises a significant public
health risk.

A quick examination of the Device Problems, also established by the MDR
submission reveals CGM technology possessing bugs that compel healthcare
provider consultations.

Subject: Microsoft-Led Team Retracts Disputed Quantum-Computing Paper
  (WiReD)

The 2018 report in Nature claimed to have found evidence of an elusive
subatomic particle. A review found that the group had omitted key data.

A Microsoft-led team of physicists has retracted a high-profile 2018 paper
that the company touted as a key breakthrough in the creation of a practical
quantum computer, a device that promises vast new computing power by tapping
quantum mechanics.

The retracted paper came from a lab headed by Microsoft physicist Leo
Kouwenhoven at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. It claimed
to have found evidence of Majorana particles, long-theorized but never
conclusively detected. The elusive entities are at the heart of Microsoft's
approach to quantum computing hardware, which lags behind that of others
such as IBM and Google.  [...]

Microsoft's Majorana mess adds a new chapter to the mythos of the particles,
which are named after Italian theorist Ettore Majorana. He hypothesized in
1937 that subatomic particles should exist that are their own antiparticles
but appeared to vanish early the next year after boarding a ship.

Perhaps he encountered his anti-Ettore?

Twitter users who used the word *Memphis* found themselves temporarily
locked out of their accounts over the weekend because of a bizarre bug.
Reports of the bug emerged after some soccer fans noticed that posts
mentioning Olympique Lyonnais player Memphis Depay were being blocked.

Yup. The logistics of getting all of those checks back to the issuing bank
was quite complex. One time in the 1970s I was on the last bus of the night
from Boston going up to visit a friend in New Hampshire. It was a long trip
because the bus stopped at every little bank branch along the way where the
driver dropped a bag of canceled checks into the night deposit box. If a
check was bad, it then had to take the reverse route back to the depositor's
bank.

Right, because the process of paying the check is still an electronic
version of the paper one. It only takes a few seconds to send an image of
the check to your bank, but finding out whether there is money to pay the
check can take anywhere from zero if the check is on the same bank, to a
couple of days if it's on a little bank on the other side of the country
that only does one batch transaction with the clearinghouse a day, one day
to receive your check, the next day to send back the bounce, and probably
not until the day after that until your bank reverses it in your
account. Banks usually give you access to funds before that if your account
has been open for a while and you don't have a history of depositing bad
checks, but the bank is still taking some risk that the money will turn out
to be there.

As I said in a previous message, they're fixing this via the Fed's FedNow
and private TCH which will do realtime payments and clearing, but it'll be a
lot of work to get all those little banks the bus used to visit processing
payments online in real time.

There seems to be a misunderstanding here.

The point of precision farming is to use pesticides, fertilizers etc., only
locally, when and where needed, instead of indiscriminately applying them to
the whole field.

If successful, this will decrease pesticide resistance, thereby leading to
*less* pesticide resistance than conventional methods.

That's a matter of opinion.

The Dutch government abandoned any kind of voting machines several elections
ago. Paper ballots are marked by pencil and votes are counted by hand. This
works well and does not lead to excessive delays in publishing the result.

The ballot for the on-going election for Parliament is huge: 37 parties with
a total of 1579 candidates.

Subject: Re: Too much choice is hurting America (Stein on NYTimes item)

It's taken me a few days to settle on a truly appropriate response to Paul
Krugman's Jeremiad on "Too Much Choice", but I think I've arrived at an
appropriate solution: Since Krugman is uncomfortable with so much choice,
here's a few suggestions about how he can reduce his anxiety:

1. Eat only one thing, just like dogs and cats do--same kibble every day.

2. Stay at home all day, every day, because there's way too many places to
   see and visit. (Oops, that's our Covid world, but for Paul, we'll just
   make it permanent.)

3. Wear the same clothing, every day. (Oops, still Covid!)

4. Read only one book; the same book, day after day. (Oops, that's the realm
   of the religious right.)

5. Reduce the number of channels on TV to three. (Heck, it worked for Paul
   when Paul was growing up.)

6. Only use his landline phone; there are way too many apps available on
   smartphones. (Perhaps the reason people spend so much time looking at
   their smartphones is trying out all of those apps?)

7. Only talk to people who already agree with you; there are way too many
   ideas in this world already. (Paul has this one nailed!!)

8. Only listen to one piece of music, over and over again.  Solieri (in
   Amadeus) was right: there's "too many notes".

9. Burn your Krugman/Wells "Economics" textbooks; "Samuelson" was already a
   perfectly good Econ101 textbook.

10. I challenge Krugman to restrict himself to the 2000-word vocabulary of
   Basic English for his remaining NYTimes columns; those 50 cent words he
   uses are only "dog whistles" to the elites, anyway.

Eisenhower may have said it best: "If you want total security, go to
prison. There you're fed, clothed, given medical care and so on. The only
thing lacking is freedom [i.e., lack of choice]."

Subject: Re: Boeing 777 PW4000 engine problems (RISKS-32.54)

Prof. Ladkin -- Thank you for an exquisitely sagacious rebuttal to my
equivalence of jet propulsion maintenance practice to that of auto service
repair outcomes.

I acknowledge aviation history establishing air travel as the safest means
of conveyance yet invented. This achievement credits the significant
engineering, qualification, and rigorous maintenance practices applied per
regulations to ensure reliable transportation.

These spectacular engine failure incidents temporarily weaken public
trust. Identifying a root cause, and establishing a maintenance inspection
interval that diminishes "blade throwing" incident recurrence will be
essential to reestablish P&W brand reputation. Trust erosion negatively
impacts both the P&W brand and the air transport industry.

When public trust is weakened by repeat product failures, despite best
industrial practices and regulations designed to suppress such incidents, it
arouses suspicions about practice reliability and the wisdom behind
enforcement regulations.

The airworthiness directives
(https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/02/15/2019-02453/airworthiness-directives-pratt-and-whitney-division-pw-turbofan-engines,
and
https://www.faa.gov/news/media/attachments/Emergency%20AD%20Document%20AD-2021-00188-E.pdf)
recommend a review of and revision to jet engine inspection frequency for
metal fatigue using thermal acoustic imaging (TAI).

~128 engine pairs (256 engines) must be inspected @ $2K/engine per "Boeing
777 grounding explained visually: Pratt and Whitney engine failure involved
in two incidents on same day" retrieved from
https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/travel/news/2021/02/22/boeing-777-grounding-engine-failure-pratt-and-whitney-united-flight-328-who-makes-the-engines/4541359001/.
When a jet's not flying, it doesn't generate revenue.

Whether there is a design, qualification, or maintenance issue is immaterial
to the flying public. They should not need a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering
or metal fatigue expertise to determine whether or not it is "safe to fly"
by personally reviewing TAI scans and maintenance records.

What is necessary, in my opinion, is for aviation propulsion suppliers to
offer greater disclosure about the qualification and maintenance processes
that facilitate airworthiness certification.

Perhaps the pilots, and fleet maintenance/safety personnel, might want to
know the "chicken gun" qualification (see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_gun), and volcanic dust/particulate
material exposure results for each engine strapped into their aircraft?
Should they be required to review and approve engine maintenance results as
part of pre-flight checklist?

These tests are likely destructive, and certainly injurious, to the engine's
compressors and ignition/thrust structures. Running them per engine
maintenance cycle seems unwise.

How the P&W compressor inspection maintenance interval was established
initially is not a matter for me to explore. It is probably fixed based on
certain qualification measurements and other factors. There may be a "safety
factor" multiplier eyeballed into the maintenance cycle frequency based on
history or "best industry practice."

I would be curious to know if commercial jet engine airworthiness
qualification has been delegated under the FAA's self-certification program,
or if the government retains exclusive authority.
