Michaeleen Doucleff, *NPR*, May 9, 202312:02 AM ET, Heard on Morning Edition

For the first time, the American Psychological Association has issued
recommendations for guiding teenager's use of social media. The advisory,
released Tuesday, is aimed at teens, parents, teachers and policy makers.

This comes at a time when teenagers are facing high rates of depression,
anxiety and loneliness. And, as NPR has reported, there's mounting evidence
that social media can exacerbate and even cause these problems.

"Right now, I think the country is struggling with what we do around
social media," says Dr. Arthur Evans, CEO of the APA. The report, he
says, marshals the latest science about social media to arm people
"with the information that they need to be good parents and to be good
policy makers in this area."

The 10 recommendations in the report summarize recent scientific findings
and advise actions, primarily by parents, such as monitoring teens' feeds
and training them in social media literacy, even before they begin using
these platforms.

Subject: Doctors warn about AI's "existential threat to humanity (Axios)

Artificial intelligence poses "an existential threat to humanity" akin to
nuclear weapons in the 1980s and should be reined in until it can be
properly regulated, an international group of doctors and public health
experts warned Tuesday in *BMJ Global Health
<https://globalhealth.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjgh-2022-010435>*.

What they're saying: "With exponential growth in AI research and
development, the window of opportunity to avoid serious and potentially
existential harms is closing," wrote the authors, among them experts from
the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and the
International Institute for Global Health.

The big picture: The warning comes amid increasing calls for improved
oversight of artificial intelligence from the likes of Geoffrey Hinton, the
so-called godfather of AI, who announced he was quitting Google over his
worries about threats from machine learning, PBS reports
<https://www.pbs.org/video/the-future-of-ai-1683317973/>.

Zoom in: The physicians and public health experts say the health care
community needs to sound the alarm "even as parts of our community espouse
the benefits of AI in the fields of health care and medicine."

   - They cite AI's ability to rapidly analyze sets of data could be
   misused for surveillance and information campaigns to "further undermine
   democracy by causing a general breakdown in trust or by driving social
   division and conflict, with ensuing public health impacts."
   - They also raised concerns about the development of future weapons
   systems which could be capable of locating, selecting and killing "at an
   industrial scale" without the need for human supervision.
   - And they noted AI's potential impact on jobs.
   - "While there would be many benefits from ending work that is
   repetitive, dangerous, and unpleasant, we already know that unemployment is
   strongly associated with adverse health outcomes and behavior," they said.

Between the lines: Health industries have been grappling with the potential
benefits of AI -- the improved ability to diagnose disease, discover new
therapies, answer patient questions and perform menial tasks -- and its
potential harms.

   - Studies have cited hospital algorithms that discriminated against
   Black patients by allocating less care to them.

Subject: ChatGPT Will See You Now: Doctors Using AI to Answer Patient
 Questions (WSJ)

*Pilot program aims to see if AI will cut time that medical staff spend
replying to online inquiries*

Behind every physician's medical advice is a wealth of knowledge, but
soon, patients across the country might get advice from a different
source: artificial intelligence.

In California and Wisconsin*, *OpenAI's GPT generative artificial
intelligence is reading patient messages and drafting responses from
their doctors. The operation is part of a pilot program in which three
health systems test if the AI will cut the time that medical staff
spend replying to patients' online inquiries.

UC San Diego Health and UW Health began testing the tool in April. Stanford
Health Care aims to join the rollout early next week. Altogether, about two
dozen healthcare staff are piloting this tool.

Marlene Millen, a primary care physician at UC San Diego Health who is
helping lead the AI test, has been testing GPT in her inbox for about a
week. Early AI-generated responses needed heavy editing, she said, and her
team has been working to improve the replies. They are also adding a kind of
bedside manner: If a patient mentioned returning from a trip, the draft
could include a line that asked if their travels went well. ``It gives the
human touch that we would,'' Millen said.

There is preliminary data that suggests AI could add value. ChatGPT scored
better than real doctors at responding to patient queries posted online,
according to a study published Friday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine,
in which a panel of doctors did blind evaluations of posts.  [...]

There is no logic.  prompted with "the Moon is made of..." it can say
"rocks" or "green cheese" but probably not "colorless green ideas."

Using ChatGPT to answer patients is an attempt to trick the patient into
thinking that their inquiry is being answered, and sending random garbage
instead.  People expect their medical advice to be based on knowledge and
reasoning.  This is not.

Subject: Dominion tells its Fox story: Axios exclusive interview

After reaching a settlement with Fox News for $787.5 Million, Dominion
Voting Systems speaks exclusively with Axops Pro Rata author Dan Primack.

Dominion Voting Systems was once an obscure, private equity-owned election
machine maker. It seems to wish it still was, despite securing a $787.5
million settlement from Fox News.

Why it matters: Three key players from Dominion, speaking exclusively with
Axios Pro Rata author Dan Primack, describe the Fox settlement as a shot
across the bow for defendants in six remaining cases.  Four takeaways from
Dan's interviews with Dominion CEO John Poulos; Hootan Yaghoobzadeh,
co-founder of Staple Street Capital, Dominion's private equity owner; and
Stephen Shackelford, outside attorney on the Fox case:

1. Dominion felt its business was badly burned by accusations Fox aired
about the 2020 presidential election.

Existing employees received death threats, sometimes including their home
addresses. Recruiting new employees became almost impossible.  Dominion had
some customers cancel contracts early. Some potential clients said the firm
was too politically radioactive to hire.Staple Street Capital, which bought
the business in 2018, had laid out a growth plan and was prepping a series
of acquisitions and international expansion. All of that was disrupted in
the days following the 2020 election.

2. Staple Street's CEO felt a sense of deja vu.

Yaghoobzadeh's family immigrated to the U.S. from Iran when he was 5-years
old, fearing persecution during that country's revolution.

3. Dominion wasn't very interested in an on-air apology.

The company didn't believe it would have been sincere.  Shackelford adds
that things might have gone a bit differently if Fox had publicly apologized
early.

4. Tucker Carlson's firing wasn't a condition of the settlement. But
Dominion and its lawyers believe the lawsuit and the pre-trial discovery
"got that rock moving."

Dominion appears to be going full steam ahead on six other pending lawsuits
against One America News, Newsmax, Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani, Patrick
Byrne and Mike Lindell.  Reality check: None of those are expected to reach
trial before 2024."  Dominion Voting Systems tells its Fox News lawsuit

Something is seriously garbled here. There is no Inmarsat-41 satellite.
They are probably referring to Inmarsat-4 F1 which failed on April 16 and
came back into service on 19 Apr 2023.

BUT, that is a geosynchronous communication satellite in orbit at about
36000 Km. It has nothing whatsoever to do with GPS, which is an unrelated
system using 38 satellites in 20000 Km orbits.

I believe something went wrong that made the tractors fail, but it wasn't
GPS. I wonder what it was.

Subject: Re: Farmers crippled by satellite failure as GPS-guided tractors

GNSS positioning needs at least four good quality satellite signals to
calculate an accurate 3-D+Time fix (by solving simultaneous equations).

To get cm level accuracy requires a GPS receiver which also receives
messages with accuracy corrections for satellite orbits, regional
ionospheric and tropospheric conditions; see:

https://www.septentrio.com/en/learn-more/insights/gnss-corrections-demystified

Because of space weather, satellite signal interference, and occasional
service outages, these signals from regional broadcast satellite services,
like that from Inmarsat I-4 F1, are usually backed up by other satellites,
terrestrial internet and/or radio alternatives, including mobile 3GPP, which
these Australian farmers, or their equipment suppliers, appear not to have
considered essential to ensure operation.

This *has* been addressed, by kicking the can even further down the road:
For several years now, the GPS signal has extended the 10-bit week number
by an additional 3 bits, i.e., it is now a ~160-year rollover instead of
every ~20 years.

You do need updated GPS receiver firmware to be able to use that 13-bit week
number though, and there are many other ways to solve the issue:

The most obvious is probably to just have a writable flash-memory record
where the current year is written every week/month/year: On a full
reset/restart you read that field and use it to determine which week epoch
you are in. This works as long as the year field is updated at least once
every 20 years.

An even cheaper solution would be to hardcode the compilation date of the
firmware, but this has already failed (after 20 years!) in embedded
equipment where firmware is effectively never updated.

There is a GPS 1024 week rollover about every 19.6 years, the last was 2019
Apr 6 Sat/7 Sun, the next will be 2038 Nov 20 Sat/21 Sun (GPS time - epoch
== TAI @ 1980 Jan 6 Sun == TAI - 19s since 2017 == UTC + 18s since 2017).

The real problem is cheap receivers do not decode the GPS messages with
extended 13-bit 8192-week numbers (possibly using only a receiver chip
vendor's basic reference design or licensed IP), so they add windowing based
on some build date, and after 1024 weeks, or sometimes a smaller portion of
that (as decided by the vendor), the receiver time decoding reaches EoL and
wraps around.

Effectively, yes, but with more engineering in the major supported NTP
daemons ntpd, chrony, ntpsec, which have all added similar GPS week rollover
window mitigation, based on the daemon build date (perhaps by now some
significant accurate persistent file system date info also), to compensate
for GPS dates before the build (or file system or file) date, and add weeks
to adjust the messages to the current time.

Subject: Software Obsolescence (Ross Anderson)

Rebecca Mercuri noted a remarkably relevant one-hour Software Engineering
podcast episode, from the IEEE Computer Society, with Ross Anderson on
Software Obsolescence, with interesting related links:
https://www.se-radio.net/2023/04/se-radio-559-ross-anderson-on-software-obsolescence/

There are some pithy examples for RISKS, but I would rather you got them
from Ross.
