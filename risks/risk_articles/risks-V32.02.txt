Subject: TikTok Teens and K-Pop Fans Say They Sank Trump Rally (NYTimes)

  Did a successful prank inflate attendance expectations for President Trump's
  rally in Tulsa, Okla.?  [...]

  TikTok users and fans of Korean pop music groups claimed to have
  registered potentially hundreds of thousands of tickets for Mr. Trump's
  campaign rally as a prank. After the Trump campaign's official account
  @TeamTrump posted a tweet asking supporters to register for free tickets
  using their phones on June 11, K-pop fan accounts began sharing the
  information with followers, encouraging them to register for the rally --
  and then not show.

  The trend quickly spread on TikTok, where videos with millions of views
  instructed viewers to do the same, as CNN reported on Tuesday. ``Oh no, I
  signed up for a Trump rally, and I can't go,'' one woman joked, along with
  a fake cough, in a TikTok posted on June 15.

  [The title Monty sent me is the one online, which says `Stans' instead of
  `Fans'.  Could be a ligature problem?  I presume it might get corrected
  later.  I am ahead of the curve.  PGN]

  ``During the 2020 primary election, Los Angeles County launched its new
  Voting Solutions for All People (VSAP), a highly ambitious project that
  dramatically changed the experience of voting in the nation’s most
  populous county.  Although many voters welcomed the improvements, many
  others experienced significant challenges, including excessive wait times
  at Vote Centers.''  [...]

  ``Overarching quality control breakdowns and vendor management issues:
  Inadequate vendor and timeline management resulted in a lack of quality
  assurance for election processes and technology deployments.  Poor
  technology vendor management resulted in the lack of identification of
  critical design issues.  This led to long wait times and a poor voter
  experience during the election.''

  [Both of these sources add fuel to the fires continuing to burst anew
  relating to election integrity.  The first one relates to the LA County
  Registrar, extensive voter disenfranchisement, compliance issues, and
  problems with the VSAP system -- including lack of adequate testing.  The
  prospects for clean elections in November are continuing to be highly
  questionable.  PGN]

Subject: French Court Strikes Down Most of Online Hate Speech Law
  (The New York Times)

PARIS — A top French court on Thursday struck down critical provisions of a
law passed by France's parliament last month to combat online hate speech,
dealing a severe blow to the government's effort to police Internet content.

The court’s ruling comes as authorities around the world try to regulate
what can be shared on vast Internet platforms like Facebook, YouTube or
Twitter, all American companies with attitudes toward free speech and
government oversight that often differ from Europe's.

The flagship provision in France's new law, which was supported by President
Emmanuel Macron's government and sponsored by his party, created an
obligation for online platforms to take down hateful content flagged by
users within 24 hours. If the platforms failed to do so, they risked fines
of up to 1.25 million euros, or about $1.4 million.

But the Constitutional Council, a French court that reviews legislation to
ensure it complies with the French constitution, noted in its ruling on
Thursday that the measure put the onus for analyzing content solely on tech
platforms without the involvement of a judge, within a very short time
frame, and with the threat of hefty penalties.

It sometimes seems that automated bots are taking over social media and
driving human discourse. But some (real) researchers aren't so sure.

Subject: Mild virus cases may bestow far lower immunity (AFP)

People who catch COVID-19 but don't show symptoms may have significantly
lower levels of immunity against the virus than those who become severely
ill, new research showed Thursday.

The majority of virus patients display relatively minor signs of infection,
and a small proportion show no symptoms at all.

Very little is known about this group, given that they are far less likely
to be tested than those who go on to develop severe symptoms including
respiratory problems.

Researchers based in China compared two groups of individuals infected with
COVID-19 in Chongqing's Wanzhou district: 37 who showed symptoms versus 37
who did not.

The researchers analysed blood samples from both groups taken a few weeks
after recovering and found that just 62.2 percent of the asymptomatic group
had short-term antibodies, compared with 78.4 percent of symptomatic
patients.

After eight weeks of convalescence, antibody presence had fallen in 81.1
percent of asymptomatic patients, compared with 62.2 percent of symptomatic
patients.

What's more, asymptomatic patients were found to have lower levels of 18
pro- anti-inflammatory cell-signaling proteins than the symptomatic group,
suggesting a weaker immune response to the novel coronavirus.

Authors of the study, which was published in Nature Medicine, said their
findings called into question the idea that everyone who has had
coronavirus are immune to future infection. [...]

Subject: Contact Tracing

As I predicted, contact tracing here in the U.S. is largely a failure.  Most
people don't trust any apps for this purpose, and refuse to give personal
information to human tracers who contact them (no pun intended). This wasn't
rocket science to predict.
