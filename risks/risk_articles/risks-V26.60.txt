An ANA 737 went nearly belly up during cruise flight after the first officer
turned the wrong knob to let the captain back into the cockpit. The knob for
the rudder is similar to the knob to unlock the door and both are located in
close proximity to each other. Luckily, it was late at night and most
passengers were wearing their seat belts.

E-voting remains insecure, despite paper trail
Microsoft researchers propose using cryptography technique as
temporary Band-Aid for making new e-voting systems more secure
By Ted Samson | InfoWorld

opening and closing paragraphs:

Microsoft Research has revealed a potential flaw in verifiable e-voting
machines through which fraudsters could easily use discarded ballot receipts
as a guide for altering votes. Fortunately, the researchers also offered a
solution -- linking new receipts to previous ones with cryptographic hashes
-- but that alone won't make e-voting entirely secure, they cautioned.

This Microsoft Research report offers a fine example of how
electronic-voting systems have improved to a degree, but it also shows that
there's a lot of work to be done to make e-voting truly secure and
verifiable. The fact that so many lawmakers have continued to drag their
feet on this issue, even in light of documented controversies surrounding
e-voting over the past several years, suggests at best an abysmally high
level of technical ignorance among elected officials. At worst, it implies a
general disregard for the democratic process on which this country was
founded, a high level of corruption, or some combination thereof.

Subject: Alleged Absentee Ballot Fraud in Florida

In Madison County, Florida, 8 residents have been arrested -- among them
the election supervisor and a school board member -- relating to the
2010 school board election in that county.  Apparently, the winner in one
district was implicated in illegally creating absentee ballots mailed to
false addresses, without voters' knowledge.

This reminds me of an incident in the 2000 election in Florida, in which the
inhabitants of entire rest home had voted 100% for one candidate, although
*none* of those residents who had been interviewed by ABC had actually
requested an absentee ballot -- according to the ABC news reporter recording
me.  I suspect this is not uncommon.

  "A global internet outage took down sites and services across the web on
  Monday.  The outage began shortly after 2pm, and affected telco Time
  Warner Cable in the US and numerous ISPs in the UK, including Eclipse
  Internet and Easynet.  Several of the affected companies blamed the
  downtime on a problem with the firmware in Juniper Network routers.  "This
  outage has affected other networks running Juniper routers with the
  majority of them seeing their devices core dump and reload," affected ISP
  Phyber Communications said."  http://j.mp/sPisRG  (Silicon)

Time Warner has said their entire Internet network operation was affected by
this.  I've been having connectivity problems on one of my primary circuits
since late yesterday and continuing now that may or may not be related.
I'll see if this message makes it out.

Subject: Gmail goes Colbert (From Dave Farber's IP)

The new gmail that apparently is going to be forced on everyone is not an
improvement as far as I can see. It has a lot of cosmetic changes that
someone liked, but the amazing thing is the way they are introducing
it. There is no way to revert to the old version, but they devote special
buttons to tell you how nice the new look is and to ask for you for
feedback. The feed back section has just two Colbert-like questions: "What
do you like about the new version?" and "What, if anything, would you change
about the new version?" Colbert would ask something like "Is this awesome or
super-awesome?" but he's trying to be ironic.

I just got this e-mail from reception of the building I'm in today:

  "With the clocks going back by one hour this has caused the security door
  in the reception area to automatically lock at 17:00 instead of 18:00. Due
  to our system being down at the moment we are unable to change
  this. Please can I remind you that you should carry you pass with you at
  all times for security reasons."

So, of the three security systems mentioned, both the automated ones have
partially failed, the fallback is to *e-mail* me to remind me to carry a
pass so I won't get locked on the landing on my way back from the WC.
Hardly a disaster, but annoying none the less.

Subject: NASA Confirms 'Suspicious Events' in Satellite Hacking Report

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-27/chinese-military-suspected-in-hacker-attacks-on-u-s-satellites.html

Chinese Military Suspected in Hacker Attacks on U.S. Satellites
By Tony Capaccio and Jeff Bliss - Oct 26, 2011 9:01 PM PT

Computer hackers, possibly from the Chinese military, interfered with
two U.S. government satellites four times in 2007 and 2008 through a
ground station in Norway, according to a congressional commission.

The intrusions on the satellites, used for earth climate and terrain
observation, underscore the potential danger posed by hackers,
according to excerpts from the final draft of the annual report by
the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. The report is
scheduled to be released next month.

"Such interference poses numerous potential threats, particularly if
achieved against satellites with more sensitive functions," according
to the draft. "Access to a satellite's controls could allow an
attacker to damage or destroy the satellite. An attacker could also
deny or degrade as well as forge or otherwise manipulate the
satellite's transmission."

A Landsat-7 earth observation satellite system experienced 12 or more
minutes of interference in October 2007 and July 2008, according to
the report.

Hackers interfered with a Terra AM-1 earth observation satellite
twice, for two minutes in June 2008 and nine minutes in October that
year, the draft says, citing a closed-door U.S. Air Force briefing.

The draft report doesn't elaborate on the nature of the hackers'
interference with the satellites.

Chinese Military Writings

U.S. military and intelligence agencies use satellites to
communicate, collect intelligence and conduct reconnaissance. The
draft doesn't accuse the Chinese government of conducting or
sponsoring the four attacks. It says the breaches are consistent with
Chinese military writings that advocate disabling an enemy's space
systems, and particularly "ground-based infrastructure, such as
satellite control facilities."

U.S. authorities for years have accused the Chinese government of
orchestrating cyber attacks against adversaries and hacking into
foreign computer networks to steal military and commercial secrets.
Assigning definitive blame is difficult, the draft says, because the
perpetrators obscure their involvement.

The commission's 2009 report said that "individuals participating in
ongoing penetrations of U.S. networks have Chinese language skills
and have well established ties with the Chinese underground hacker
community," although it acknowledges that "these relationships do not
prove any government affiliation."
Chinese Denials

China this year "conducted and supported a range of malicious cyber
activities," this year's draft reports. It says that evidence
emerging this year tied the Chinese military to a decade-old cyber
attack on a U.S.-based website of the Falun Gong spiritual group.

Chinese officials long have denied any role in computer attacks.

The commission has "been collecting unproved stories to serve its
purpose of vilifying China's international image over the years,"
said Wang Baodong, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington,
in a statement. China "never does anything that endangers other
countries' security interests."

The Chinese government is working with other countries to clamp down
on cyber crime, Wang said.

Defense Department reports of malicious cyber activity, including
incidents in which the Chinese weren't the main suspect, rose to a
high of 71,661 in 2009 from 3,651 in 2001, according to the draft.
This year, attacks are expected to reach 55,110, compared with 55,812
in 2010.

Relying on the Internet

In the October 2008 incident with the Terra AM-1, which is managed by
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, "the responsible
party achieved all steps required to command the satellite," although
the hackers never exercised that control, according to the draft.

The U.S. discovered the 2007 cyber attack on the Landsat-7, which is
jointly managed by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey, only after
tracking the 2008 breach.

The Landsat-7 and Terra AM-1 satellites utilize the commercially
operated Svalbard Satellite Station in Spitsbergen, Norway that
"routinely relies on the Internet for data access and file
transfers," says the commission, quoting a NASA report.

The hackers may have used that Internet connection to get into the
ground station's information systems, according to the draft.

While the perpetrators of the satellite breaches aren't known for
sure, other evidence uncovered this year showed the Chinese
government's involvement in another cyber attack, according to the
draft.

TV Report

A brief July segment on China Central Television 7, the government's
military and agricultural channel, indicated that China's People's
Liberation Army engineered an attack on the Falun Gong website, the
draft said.

The website, which was hosted on a University of Alabama at
Birmingham computer network, was attacked in 2001 or earlier, the
draft says.

The CCTV-7 segment said the People's Liberation Army's Electrical
Engineering University wrote the software to carry out the attack
against the Falun Gong website, according to the draft. The Falun
Gong movement is banned by the Chinese government, which considers it
a cult.

After initially posting the segment on its website, CCTV-7 removed
the footage after media from other countries began to report the
story, the congressional draft says.

Military Disruption

The Chinese military also has been focused on its U.S. counterpart,
which it considers too reliant on computers. In a conflict, the
Chinese would try to "compromise, disrupt, deny, degrade, deceive or
destroy" U.S. space and computer systems, the draft says.

"This could critically disrupt the U.S. military's ability to deploy
and operate during a military contingency," according to the draft.

Other cyber intrusions with possible Chinese involvement included the
so-called Night Dragon attacks on energy and petrochemical companies
and an effort to compromise the Gmail accounts of U.S. government
officials, journalists and Chinese political activists, according to
the draft.

Often the attacks are found to have come from Chinese
Internet-protocol, or IP, addresses.

Businesses based in other countries and operating in China think that
computer network intrusions are among the "most serious threats to
their intellectual property," the draft says.

The threat extends to companies not located in China. On March 22,
U.S. Internet traffic was "improperly" redirected through a network
controlled by Beijing-based China Telecom Corp. Ltd., the state-owned
largest provider of broadband Internet connections in the country,
the draft said.

In its draft of last year's report, the commission highlighted
China's ability to direct Internet traffic and exploit "hijacked"
data.

Subject: Apple was OK to fire man for private Facebook comments

Anna Leach: 'Image is so central to Apple's success', says tribunal,
*The Register*, 3 Nov 2011
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/03/apple_employee_fired/

selected text:

Apple was right to fire an employee of one of its UK stores for saying rude
things about the company on his Facebook wall, an employment tribunal in
Bury St Edmunds ruled.*

The tribunal judge upheld Apple's dismissal of the man for gross misconduct
in a case which sets another precedent for social network users who like to
bitch about work online.

The Apple Store worker had made derogatory comments about Apple's brand and
products on his Facebook wall. Although his posts were not public, one of
his unfriendlier "friends" -- also a colleague in the store -- printed the
comments out and showed them to their boss, who fired the man for
misconduct.

A striking feature of the case was that although the man's Facebook comments
were not public - privacy settings had been applied - the judge decided
because that the comments could be easily copied and pasted by his friends
they did not attract any privacy protection.

This bad idea was already tried by BART, with disastrous results.  There
are many socially beneficial uses for smartphones that don't involve
driving.  Even interfering with communication inside cars is a bad idea,
because it ignores the fact that the passengers might be the ones
contacting the babysitter to inform them they're going to be late.

Good details all, but my concern was with *intentional* interference with
the flight systems, e.g., terrorism. It is a question necessarily suggested
I think by any concerns re interference by consumer electronics. In the
general operation of highly complex, fly-by-wire aircraft, such a deliberate
act could be a very bad thing. I have to hope contingency plans are in
place, and they probably aren't. There are I must believe alternatives (for
example hardened navigation options, like some sort of failsafe gyroscopic
or accelerometer control system (the wiser minds here will have better
ideas). Flying these large planes is a highly abstract exercise and flight
crews unprepared for malfunctions, as apparently with Air France 447, can be
rendered suddenly helpless -- flying at cruising altitude is itself a
flight-critical operation.

That's the first sensible justification that I've heard on this list for
prohibiting passengers from using devices that are allowed in the cockpit.

Of course, the airlines still don't get it quite right, since many still
permit (as only one example) the wearing of noise-canceling headphones that
are turned off; those, too, would be unpleasant to encounter at high speed.

Subject: What happens when *everyone's* PII is leaked?

We've all seen hundreds of cases of PII being lost, stolen, etc.  But what
happens when an entire country's PII gets released?  Is that better or worse
- since absolutely everybody is potentially affected, is the government
forced to reissue authentication information to everyone, and change all the
databases?  (Assuming you can identify everyone to ensure that they get the
right authenticators, that is.)  Does the fact that it affects everyone mean
that people will be more cautious of social engineering attacks, since
everyone knows that they could be the target?  Or does it reduce the value
of the lost/stolen information, since everyone will be more on guard against
attacks?

"The database provides the personal and familial information of all Israeli
citizens in the Population Registry -- more than nine million people, some
of whom are no longer alive. Each citizen's family relations, personal
identification number and other private information are contained in the
database.  [...] At some point, the registry was sold for the paltry sum of
only a few thousand shekels [less than US$1000], and it is likely that it
was used for malevolent purposes. Since the start of the investigation,
Israeli agents have attempted to track down every copy of the registry and
remove it from the Internet. "

Of course removing "every copy" from the Internet is a fool's errand.

I don't have any answers to what the reaction will be, but we may have
a case study to watch.  The database was leaked several years ago, but
I only just read about it in an article about figuring out how the
information came to be posted on the web.

A contract worker from the Ministry of Labor and Welfare was charged with
stealing the personal information of over 9 million Israelis from the
Population Registry, the Justice Ministry announced Monday after a media ban
was lifted.

The worker electronically copied identification numbers, full names,
addresses, dates of birth, information on family connections and other
information in order to sell it to a private buyer.

The information was also given to another individual who used it to design a
software program called "Agron 2006", which exploited the database to allow
queries of all Israeli citizens, allowing information to be illegally sold
based on various parameters. Those parameters could include familial
relationships of the entire Israeli population, over several generations.
