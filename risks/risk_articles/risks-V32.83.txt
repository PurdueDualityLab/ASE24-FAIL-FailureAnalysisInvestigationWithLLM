*The New York Times* Business front page, 17 Aug 2021

After a series of crashes, U,S, safety regulators open a broad inquiry at a
system's potential flaws.

The investigation was prompted by at least 11 accidents in which Teslas
using Autopilot ... drove into parked fire trucks, police cars, and other
emergency vehicles.

Subject: Self-Driving Car Company to Test a Second Autonomous Vehicle in NYC
 (Streetsblog New York City)

Wait a minute -- there’s going to be another one of those things out there?
And then five more?!

A tech firm that has been quietly testing a single self-driving car on the
streets of New York City -- which prompted the Department of Transportation
to initiate a process to further regulate the testing of such driverless
vehicles — is about to deploy a second “look-ma-no-hands” car in Gotham this
month, with plans for five more by the end of the year, Streetsblog has
learned. [...]

Throughout the video, Shashua referred to Mobileye’s work in New York as
“battle testing” and used combat themes to describe the work his company is
doing here.

``Battle testing of AV is very challenging in New York,” he said. “If we
want to build at scale, we have to drive in places that are challenging.  …
And scale is important. You cannot build a business unless you can operate
at scale.''  [...]

But the theme that Shashua kept coming back to was the difficulties of
driving in New York City, with five main things that “stand out” in New York
versus other world capitals:

  “Pedestrians and jaywalking”: “In New York City, this is really a class of
  its own. Pedestrians don’t respect the rules. When I’m in California and
  everywhere else in the world, if there is a red light, [pedestrians] don’t
  cross. In New York City, you cross. That’s New York City. You have
  jaywalkers and pedestrians and you have tons of them.” He made it sound as
  if everything would be so much easier if the pedestrians could be
  reformed.

  “Driving behavior”: “People here are very very assertive because the
  majority of drivers here are professional drivers. Whether they are Uber,
  Lyft or taxis, they are driving because they need to make their
  living. They don’t have time to be polite. The culture here is very, very
  aggressive when the traffic is congested. It is unlike everywhere
  else. People complain about Boston, but New York City is much worse.”

  “Light pollution”: “There is no night here in the city,” he said.

  “Double-parking”: “You have double-parking everywhere,” he said, making it
  “quite tricky” for an autonomous car to determine whether the “vehicle in
  front of it is an obstacle and not just standing in a line in a traffic
  jam. The car driving in New York City needs to make that decision every
  100 meters. [The car has to calculate] ‘What is an obstacle I need to
  overate [[sic, or maybe sick if it really over-ate. PGN]] and what is a
  car that is just standing in a jam and I have to be patient.’ It is very
  tricky.”

  “Road users diversity”: You have carriages pulled by horse and so many
  different types of road users beyond pedestrians. You don’t find this in
  other cities.”

  “It’s really a huge headache to test here in New York City,” he concluded.

Subject: Technical Issue Gives Some Metro Riders Unexpected SmarTrip Boost
 (DCist)

Commuters returning to Metro for the first time might be surprised to have a
lot more money on their SmarTrip card than they should -- and even more
surprised when that dollar amount drops suddenly.

A technical issue with SmartBenefits -- the system used by employers to
deposit money onto their employees’ SmarTrip accounts -- is causing higher
amounts of money to be displayed for some riders when they swipe into the
system. Once the rider uses up the actual amount on the card, it will
display zero dollars, despite the prior swipes showing much more.

The problem comes from a lot of people stopping SmartBenefits during the
pandemic. People who haven’t ridden the system for a year and a half likely
don’t remember how much money they had on their card when they last
traveled.

It appears that in some cases, monthly SmartBenefits appeared like they were
still added to accounts after they were stopped or paused during the
pandemic, leading to the unexpectedly high balances shown at the
fare-gates. In reality, the money was never added to the accounts.

  Benefits appeared to be added, but weren't.  What could go wrong?

"The lost data included images, video, audio, case notes and other
information gathered by police officers and detectives, police said in an
earlier statement. A city IT employee was moving the files, which had not
been accessed for the previous six to 18 months, from an online, cloud-based
archive to a server at the city’s data center. The 'employee failed to
follow proper, established procedures, resulting in the deletion of the data
files,' police said."

"The researchers used the May 8, 1953 'Encore' event as a basis for testing
their WRF hypothesis. Using global atmospheric reanalysis data to simulate
conditions on that date, they fed the WRF model the parameters of a nuclear
fireball and dialed in the resolution accordingly. After running the model,
their simulation matched the 1953 photos remarkably well."

Subject: Mysterious Hacker Group Suspected in July Cyberattack on Iranian
 Trains (NYTimes)'

When a cyberattack on Iran’s railroad system last month caused widespread
chaos with hundreds of trains delayed or canceled, fingers naturally pointed
at Israel, which has been locked in a long-running shadow war with Tehran.

But a new investigation by an Israeli-American cybersecurity company, Check
Point Software Technologies, concluded that a mysterious group opposed to
the Iranian government was most likely behind the hack. That is in contrast
to many previous cyberattacks, which were attributed to state entities. The
group is known as Indra, named after the god of war in Hindu mythology.

Subject: Dozens of STARTTLS Related Flaws Found Affecting Popular Email
 Clients (The Hacker News)

Security researchers have disclosed as many as 40 different vulnerabilities
associated with an opportunistic encryption mechanism in mail clients and
servers that could open the door to targeted man-in-the-middle (MitM)
attacks, permitting an intruder to forge mailbox content and steal
credentials.

The now-patched flaws, identified in various STARTTLS implementations, were
*detailed*
<https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/poddebniak>
by a group of researchers Damian Poddebniak, Fabian Ising, Hanno Böck, and
Sebastian Schinzel at the 30th USENIX Security Symposium. In an
Internet-wide scan conducted during the study, 320,000 email servers were
found vulnerable to what's called a command injection attack.

Some of the popular clients affected by the bugs include Apple Mail, Gmail,
Mozilla Thunderbird, Claws Mail, Mutt, Evolution, Exim, Mail.ru, Samsung
Email, Yandex, and KMail. The attacks require that the malicious party can
tamper connections established between an email client and the email server
of a provider and has login credentials for their own account on the same
server.

STARTTLS refers to a form of *opportunistic TLS*
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS> that enables email
communication protocols such as SMTP, POP3, and IMAP to be transitioned or
upgraded from a plain text connection to an encrypted connection instead of
having to use a separate port for encrypted communication.  [...]

Subject: Autocorrect Errors in Excel Still Creating Genomics Headach
 (Dyani Lewis)

Dyani Lewis, *Nature*, 13 Aug 2021, via ACM TechNews, Monday, August 16, 2021

Autocorrect errors in spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel or Google
Sheets continue to dog academic genomics literature, according to a study of
published gene lists. This often happens when the abbreviated form of a
gene's name, or symbol, is wrongly identified and autocorrected as a date,
which means the gene is lost when the data is imported into
gene-network-analysis software. Five years after Australian researchers
brought attention to the problem, analysis by a team at Australia's Deakin
University confirmed such errors remain widespread. Deakin's Mark Ziemann
said simple checks can detect autocorrect errors, while not using
spreadsheets is another suggestion. He also said researchers can trace
errors by using scripted computer languages like Python and R, which do not
autocorrect gene symbols.

Subject: BlackBerry resisted announcing major flaw in software powering
 cars, hospital equipment

The reports are actually a bit misleading since people associate
`Blackberry' with RIMm while QNX is a Unix-like microkernel RTOS originally
from Quantum Software Systems.  QNX was popular in car head units alongside
Windows Embedded, so it's a problem in some head units, not in something
like an ECU (and yes, I know you can then leap across to other parts of the
car if they're insufficiently isolated).

Given the age of QNX and its lack of public exposure (meaning third-party
examination), I'm surprised there's only one vulnerability in it.  This
scenario in particular follows on from what happened with the i-Opener, an
Internet appliance built on top of QNX.  The existence of a $99 device that
you could shovel Linux onto meant that the previously secure-in-obscurity
QNX got a free security evaluation by a bunch of hackers, who promptly found
a security bypass allowing it to be sidegraded to a Linux appliance.

Perhaps the moral here is "be too boring to be of interest to anyone".

Subject: New AdLoad Variant Bypasses Apple's Security Defenses to Target
 macOS Systems (The Hacker News)

A new wave of attacks involving a notorious macOS adware family has evolved
to leverage around 150 unique samples in the wild in 2021 alone, some of
which have slipped past Apple's on-device malware scanner and even signed
by its own notarization service, highlighting the malicious software
ongoing attempts to adapt and evade detection.

"AdLoad," as the malware is known, is one of several widespread adware and
bundleware loaders targeting macOS since at least 2017. It's capable of
backdooring an affected system to download and install adware or
potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), as well as amass and transmit
information about victim machines.

The new iteration "continues to impact Mac users who rely solely on Apple's
built-in security control XProtect for malware detection," SentinelOne
threat researcher Phil Stokes *said*
<https://labs.sentinelone.com/massive-new-adload-campaign-goes-entirely-undetected-by-apples-xprotect/>
in
an analysis published last week. "As of today, however, XProtect arguably
has around 11 different signatures for AdLoad [but] the variant used in
this new campaign is undetected by any of those rules."

The 2021 version of AdLoad latches on to persistence and executable names
that use a different file extension pattern (.system or .service), enabling
the malware to get around additional security protections incorporated by
Apple, ultimately resulting in the installation of a persistence agent,
which, in turn, triggers an attack chain to deploy malicious droppers that
masquerade as a fake Player.app to install malware.  [...]

Subject: Re: Clearing the heavens of space junk (CBS News, RISKS-32.82)

130 million small pieces of space debris is a lot. But you have to keep in
mind that space is BIG.

Most of the debris is in so-called Low Earth Orbit (LEO), let´s say between
300 and 1700 km altitude. A quick back-of-an-envelope calculation estimates
the volume of the LEO zone to be around 1 trillion cubic kilometers. That is
around 8.000 cubic kilometers per piece of debris. Debris is likely not
uniformly distributed, so the concentration may be larger in some regions
than in others, but we are still talking about a very diluted cloud of
mainly small objects.

This is consistent with the observation that spacecraft occasionally do get
hit, but that these are rare events.

I have difficulty imagining what technology would be capable of removing a
worthwhile fraction of the small debris that is so spread-out in space.

If we look at larger objects, like dead satellites and rocket stages, the
situation is different. These objects are being tracked, so we know about
potential collisions and can take evasive measures. It should be possible,
in principle, to approach and grab an object and de-orbit it.  But that´s an
expensive operation, requiring the launch of a dedicated spacecraft that
would likely only be capable of removing one, or, at most, a few objects. So
doing this on a large scale seems unrealistic.

I am not suggesting that the problem of space debris should not be taken
seriously. What I want to say is that cleaning it up is a daunting task, if
at all feasible.

The lesson we should learn is that we should make sure all future space
missions are designed for safe disposal, once the mission is over.
