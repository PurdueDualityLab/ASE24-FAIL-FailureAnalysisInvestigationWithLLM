A Shut-Off Switch Was Supposed to Prevent 99% of Generator-Related
Deaths. It Failed a Family of Three.

The generator industry has touted automatic shut-off switches as a
lifesaving fix for carbon monoxide poisoning. But the voluntary standard
falls short of what federal regulators say is necessary to eliminate deaths.

Subject: Nordstream Explosion: Robotic Sabotage from *Inside*?

An intriguing possibility is that the Nordstream LNG pipelines were
sabotaged by robots *from the inside* !

This type of sabotage would not require submarines (robotic or otherwise),
frogmen, etc., but would only require the ability to insert a modern 'pig'
(inspection robot) into the pipeline from the Russian end controlled by
Gazprom.

This type of sabotage could have been performed during the recent
*maintenance shutdowns* over the past several months, and the explosions
later set off by remote control.

27 Sep 2022

Mikhail Krutikhin, an energy analyst from the RusEnergy consultancy, told DW
that initial evidence clearly pointed to sabotage, and said that a key
question going forward would be whether the damage originated inside or
outside the pipe. He said the shape of the damaged segments of pipe should
indicate this.

There are a few bobbles: the author seems a bit confused over whether NTP is
an Internet RFC or a piece of software, and whether NTP is the IETF's only
concern.  *The New Yorker*'s predilection for diereses in English is rather
comically distracting when ritually applied to the phrase "Coordinated

technical issues and the people involved, with a particularly touching
portrait of Mills himself.  And the RISKS relevance is the points made --
not for the first time, but not badly -- about the difficulties involved in
placing the maintenance of core protocols, upon which millions of computers
depend, in the decentralized hands of nearly anonymous, unpaid volunteers
who can't always even agree on who's in charge, let alone how the protocols
should evolve.

Editorial:

  The Securities and Exchange Commission Obstructs National Security
  Public disclosure of cyber attacks shows weakness to enemies.
  Ari Schwartz, https://www.wsj.com, 29 September 2022

The Securities and Exchange Commission seems to have missed a key principle
of fighting crime: Investigators don't release all the details of an
incident before it's solved because it would make it harder to catch the
criminal. This is true in cybersecurity too.  You don't want hackers to know
they've been discovered or to highlight a company's weakness to other bad
actors. Yet a new rule from the SEC would require public disclosure of an
incident within four days of discovery, even if the hack is still under
investigation and hasn't been remedied.

Those of us who have dealt with actual cyber incidents know that a fix is
unlikely to materialize in four days. These reporting requirements will
place a spotlight on the vulnerability in the hacked company's
cybersecurity, putting the business at greater risk of suffering successive
attacks before the exploited weakness can be fixed.  That comes with a
national security risk too, as nation states often engage in or aid
cyberattacks against companies.  The SEC's new rule will help states cover
their tracks by alerting them to any discovery. And it'll make it easier for
them to find targets by highlighting what businesses are vulnerable and how.

The goal of the SEC's new rule is to inform investors about attacks, which
is a fine idea in principle. Investors should be informed about firms'
cybersecurity risks and sharing information about attacks can help other
businesses optimize their own cyber defenses.  Reporting is important, but
companies should be allowed to resolve an incident before making it public.

Other regulators are racing to require companies to report problems even
faster, creating the possibility of confusion of whom to report to and
when. Following the European Union requirement of three days, Congress has
charged the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to create rules that would
also require reporting within three days of an incident, except for
ransomware payments, which must be reported in one day. The New York State
Department of Financial Services is also asking for a report in three
days. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have
required notification no later than 36 hours after a banking organization
determines that an incident has occurred. India has skipped a time frame
altogether, requiring immediate reporting to the government.

Unlike the SEC rules, most of these allow for companies to investigate and
remediate the incident. But it would be better if the U.S. agencies worked
together to create common rules that give businesses a reasonable delay
before they report. It would go a long way toward simplifying reporting
standards if they clarified what information needs to be reported and when.

The key is to balance national security with other concerns, including
the investor's right to be informed. This balance can be achieved,
but it will requires agencies to look past their own narrow priorities
and putting the public interest, including national security, first.

Subject: NY SBOE is buying ES&S barcoding voting machines

Unfortunately, it appears that the New York State Board of Elections has
been convinced (by ES&S and Dominion and others) to purchase new voting
machines that can add votes without the voters' consent. This will be
engineered by the fact that votes will not be counted from the verified
choices that the voters made, rather there will be a barcode (generated by
the voting system) that will be used to tally the results. It doesn't take a
rocket scientist to know that this is a big mistake.

Basically this purchase, if it goes through, will wind back all of the good
work that we [DrM--Rebecca Mercuri, PGN, and Ronnie Dugger] with enormous
inspiration from Mae Churchill, when [the first two of us testified for the
NYBoE in 1988] some 3 decades ago. Doug Kellner had spearheaded the effort
to thwart the DRE purchase in NYC when he was on the City board then, and
later, in his position on the State BOE, worked hard to ensure that NY State
regulations provided plenty of checks and balances, including being the ONLY
state in the country that REQUIRES escrow of voting system source code (not
that it'll ever be looked at, but at least they have it). I ran into Doug a
few years ago (pre-COVID) and it seemed that he had grown tired of fighting
the good fight, and these recent procurement decisions appear to be evidence
of that. Hence there are various current protest letters from advocates
(familiar folks who have been also fighting for 30+ years, but haven't given
up) against these new voting systems.

  [This is slightly edited from a private message for RISKS, with
  permission, Among other things, Rebecca seems to have some concerns about
  the letters' use of the term *voter-verifiable*, which was the focus of
  her PhD thesis in 21 years ago.  If you are interested in joining in on
  this old battle that never seems to go away, please contact her for more

  [With thanks to Sevilla Finley]

The need for Louisiana to replace its voting machines dating from 2006 is
not in dispute.  What to do about them is another story.  The machines' main
problem is that votes are recorded electronically without a paper record of
each voter's selections.  However, "The problem in Louisiana is that if
someone were to allege the voting machines had been hacked, there would be
no conclusive evidence to rebut that."  [or even to prove it!]   [PGN-ed]

Subject: WashDC Metro system looking for solutions to fare evasion
 (WashPost)

Evasion has proliferated during the pandemic and is a visible reminder to
many riders of revenue Metro is not collecting

The issue has put a spotlight on Metro's recent $70 million replacement of
more than 1,200 fare gates at its 91 stations. The new gates are touch-free,
process mobile payments, display SmarTrip balances and improve Metro's
ability to collect ridership data, but do little to deter evasion of
fares. The gates predate the arrival of Clarke, who acknowledges Metro may
have erred in their design and has asked his staff to research possible
modifications.

But transit officials note they couldn't have foreseen the pandemic or its
effects, which some say has exacerbated fare evasion alongside higher gas
prices, inflation, and fewer passengers in buses or stations to discourage
evasions. They also say societal norms increasingly have been ignored during
the pandemic, a problem that extends to airlines battling passenger
disruptions, rising pedestrian deaths from reckless drivers and elevated
crime rates.

via ACM TechNews; Wednesday, October 5, 2022

Microsoft researchers said numerous servers have been compromised and
approximately 220,000 additional servers worldwide are threatened by two
critical vulnerabilities in its Exchange application. One is a server-side
request forgery vulnerability, and the other enables remote code execution
via PowerShell. The unpatched flaws were identified in August by researchers
at the Vietnamese security firm GTSC, who found that an Exchange
vulnerability was exploited to infect customer networks with malicious
webshells. The GTSC researchers said, "After successfully mastering the
exploit, we recorded attacks to collect information and create a foothold in
the victim's system. The attack team also used various techniques to create
backdoors on the affected system and perform lateral movements to other
servers in the system.  Microsoft is working on a patch for the new
vulnerabilities.

More companies are using technology to monitor virtually everything workers
do on their devices, with Gartner reporting that one in three
medium-to-large companies in the U.S. implemented a worker surveillance
system since the pandemic started, and that two out of three such companies
currently use these systems. The technology can screenshot a worker's
computer every 10 minutes, record the apps and websites they visit, and
document how long was spent on each site, among other things. However,
critics are concerned such "bossware" can be counterproductive. Teramind's
Isaac Kohn said, "Realistically, the vast majority of customers don't find
the need to enable full monitoring on all users all the time." However, Kohn
acknowledged that "the system can be abused if placed in the wrong hands."

Surprise verdict on charges that predated rampant ransomware and extortion
payoffs in more recent hacking cases

A former chief security officer for Uber was convicted Wednesday of federal
charges stemming from payments he quietly authorized to hackers who breached
the ride-hailing company in 2016.

Joe Sullivan was found guilty of obstructing justice for keeping the breach
from the Federal Trade Commission, which had been probing Uber's privacy
protections at the time, and of actively hiding a felony.

The verdict ended a dramatic case that pitted Sullivan, a prominent security
expert who was an early prosecutor of cybercrimes for the San Francisco
U.S. attorney's office, against his former government office.  In between
prosecuting hackers and being prosecuted, Sullivan served as the top
security executive at Facebook, Uber and Cloudflare.

Devorah Fischler, Penn Engineering Today, 29 Sep 2022,
via ACM TechNews, 7 Oct 2022

A team of researchers from the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), Sandia
National Laboratories, and Brookhaven National Laboratory has unveiled a
computing architecture suited for artificial intelligence (AI). The
researchers developed a transistor-free compute-in-memory (CIM) architecture
where processing and storage happen in the same place, removing transfer
time and minimizing energy consumption. The architecture, which builds on
earlier work on a ferroelectric switching scandium-alloyed aluminum nitride
semiconductor, could potentially perform up to 100 times faster than a
conventional computing architecture. The design also performs on-chip
storage, parallel search, and matrix multiplication acceleration. Penn's
Xiwen Liu said the work "proves that we can rely on memory technology to
develop chips that integrate multiple AI data applications in a way that
truly challenges conventional computing technologies."

organizations -- and for how long. However Optus have continued to store
information like drivers licence ids and passport detail which have
originally been used to identify customers.  For telcos the length of the
period that data has to be stored is more complicated because of worries
that they may be asked for communication histories in connection with
authorities' enquiries into activities like drug importation or terrorism.

Subject: Re: Wegmans Discontinues Self-Checkout App, Citing Losses
 (NYTimes, RISKS-33.46)

I am scratching my head about this one. The thing they stopped was a phone
app that you could use to scan items as you shopped and put them in your
bags. Then when you get to the self-check kiosk, you scanned a code on the
kiosk screen, it transferred the list of items to the kiosk and then you
paid and left. It was great, I used it every time I shopped there for the
past year.

They are not getting rid of the self-check kiosks, just the app. I suppose
that since there is usually a staff person watching the kiosks it is
somewhat harder to sneak stuff, but the kiosks no longer annoyingly insist
that you immediately put every item in a bag so it can weigh them and match
the weight on the scale to what you've bought. (Now that most people bring
their own bags, I suspect there's no way to handle the variable weight of
the bags that isn't even more annoying.)

The Waitrose grocery chain in the UK has had a similar self-scan scheme for
over a decade, originally with hand-held scanners they provided, now also
with a phone app:

ttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/help-information/shopping-with-waitrose/shopping-instore/quick-check

Waitrose say they may rescan the contents of your bag at the till but when I
was there they never did. I wonder why they haven't had similar problems.
Waitrose caters to an upper middle class demographic but anyone can shop
there and I would think that if it were easy to cheat, some people would.

The part of the DCD article posted here, contains the quote "It's not like
there's another Egypt you can go to."; but the truncated part does contain a
survey of alternative routes.  Some of them have failed, but at least one
succeeds: Google's Raman-Blue line from India via Saudi Arabia, Jordan and
Israel.

Also note that the posted map shows yet another alternative route, from the
Red Sea via Israel.  If Egypt tries to squeeze this resource too tight, It
wouldn't be hard for users to switch.

Subject: Re: Automakers are ignoring the simple solution to the rise of
 traffic deaths (RISKS-33.46)

Making vehicles go slower is likely to reduce the number of deaths and that
is not a bad thing, but it doesn't solve the real problem.  What needs to be
done is to reduce the number of accidents in the first place, and that means
doing things that permit drivers to see where they are going and force them
to pay attention to their driving.  This likely does require technical
solutions but not expensive ones, and in many case it requires removing
technology rather than adding it.

Subject: Castiglioncello 2022: Nuclear Weapons: New Risks

The next Castiglioncello International Conference (Oct. 21-22) will be
focused on "Nuclear Weapons: New Risks".  The conference is organized by the
Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs and the Union of Scientists
for Disarmament (USPID).

The Municipality of Rosignano Marittimo, the Interdisciplinary Center of
Sciences for Peace of the University of Pisa, the Interdepartmental Research
Center for Peace of the University of Bari and the Interdisciplinary Group
on Science Technology and Society of the CNR Pisa Research Area collaborate
for the organization of the event.

For additional information, program and registration, please refer to the
conference website: https://uspid.org/cast2022/

  [I don't quite know whether it is especially computer science or its
  subdiscipline Artificial Intelligence that has such an enormous affection
  for euphemism. We speak so spectacularly and so readily of computer
  systems that understand, that see, decide, make judgments, and so on,
  without ourselves recognizing our own superficiality and immeasurable
  naivete with respect to these concepts. And, in the process of so
  speaking, we anesthetise our ability to evaluate the quality of our work
  and, what is more important, to identify and become conscious of its end
  use.  ne can't escape this state without asking, again and again: "What do
  I actually do? What is the final application and use of the products of my
  work?" and ultimately, "am I content or ashamed to have contributed to
  this use?"  Prof. Joseph Weizenbaum ["Not without us", ACM SIGCAS 16(2-3)
