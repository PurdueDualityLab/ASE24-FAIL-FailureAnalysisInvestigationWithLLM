Subject: High-profile Twitter accounts hacked (Sundry sources)

The Twitter accounts of Barack Obama, Jeff Bezos, Joe Biden, Elon Musk and
many other high-profile people and companies became pawns Wednesday in one
of the most visible cyberscams in the Internet's history.

Suspected bitcoin scammers grabbed control of accounts belonging to the rich
and famous, as well as lower-profile accounts, for more than two hours
during the afternoon and tricked at least a few hundred people into
transferring the cryptocurrency.

A tweet typical of the attack sent from the account of Bill Gates, the
software mogul who is the world's second-wealthiest person, promised to
double all payments sent to his Bitcoin address for the next 30 minutes.

``Everyone is asking me to give back, and now is the time.  You send $1,000,
I send you back $2,000.''

Similar tweets appeared on the accounts of rapper Kanye West, investor
Warren Buffett and corporations including Apple, Wendy's, Uber and the money
transfer app Cash.

Twitter said it was looking into the attack.

``We are aware of a security incident impacting accounts on Twitter. We are
investigating and taking steps to fix it. We will update everyone shortly,''
the company said in a tweet.

    Perhaps the only sane policy is this: Always say/write what you believe
    to be true, because everyone may be listening or someone may hack into
    it.  And damn the torpedos.  The truth will out, even if it may take a
    long time.  PGN]

The hackers have been targeting British, Canadian and American organizations researching vaccines using spear-phishing and malware.

Subject: An invisible hand: Patients aren't being told about the AI systems
  advising their care (StatNews)

Rebecca Robbins and Erin Brodwin, 15 Jul 2020, via Dave Farber

Since February of last year, tens of thousands of patients hospitalized at
one of Minnesota's largest health systems have had their discharge planning
decisions informed with help from an artificial intelligence model. But few
if any of those patients has any idea about the AI involved in their care.

That's because frontline clinicians at M Health Fairview generally don't
mention the AI whirring behind the scenes in their conversations with
patients.

At a growing number of prominent hospitals and clinics around the country,
clinicians are turning to AI-powered decision support tools -- many of them
unproven -- to help predict whether hospitalized patients are likely to
develop complications or deteriorate, whether they're at risk of
readmission, and whether they're likely to die soon. But these patients and
their family members are often not informed about or asked to consent to the
use of these tools in their care, a STAT examination has found.

The result: Machines that are completely invisible to patients are
increasingly guiding decision-making in the clinic.

Hospitals and clinicians ``Care operating under the assumption that you do
not disclose, and that's not really something that has been defended or
really thought about,'' Harvard Law School professor Glenn Cohen said. Cohen
is the author of one of only a few articles examining the issue, which has
received surprisingly scant attention in the medical literature even as
research about AI and machine learning proliferates.

Subject: CJEU rejects EU-US Privacy Shield (EAID-Berlin)

https://www.eaid-berlin.de/dejavu-cjeu-rejects-eu-us-privacy-shield/

If you are baffled by the penultimate sentence, replace "wear" by "carry".Â 
(with thanks to Judith Rauhofer for the explanation that "tragen" in German
has both meanings).

  [Conversely, the German language used to uses "Sicherheit" for both
  security and safety.  Perhaps that has changed with the use of
  Cyber/Kyber/...?  PGN]

*Free* tax software is not all created equal. Some want to upsell you.
Others want the data in your tax return.

Subject: Re: Why Some Birds Are Likely To Hit Buildings (Scientific American)

While this may be entertaining, I would point out that it is unlikely that
the bird was responsible for the collision.  I would suggest that the more
realistic situation is that the bird was just flying along minding its own
business when a bloody big fat and fast moving airplane that was not
watching where it was going ran into the poor bird.

Calling it a "bird strike" is ridiculous.  The bird did not strike the
aeroplane, the aeroplane ran down the bird.  And then the aeroplane and its
operator carried on away from the scene of the mishap -- in actual fact the
aeroplane pilot committed a hit and run.

I suppose we should also call pedestrian collisions with automobiles
"pedestrian strikes" and blame it on the pedestrian deliberately striking
the automobiles.  It would certainly put an end to a lot of issues if we did
this.

Subject: Re: 24-Year-Old Australian Man Spent $2 Million After a Bank
  Glitch (RISKS-32.09)

Given that the court ruled that the overdraft was perfectly legal, and Milky
therefore had a legal right to spend the money, it may well have been the
*bank* that acted illegally in confiscated Milky's belongings. So, writing
off the rest of his debt and hoping that he wouldn't go after them is the
best that they can do, under the circumstances.
