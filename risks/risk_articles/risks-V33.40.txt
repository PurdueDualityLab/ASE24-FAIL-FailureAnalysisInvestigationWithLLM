Subject: Voters in the UK Cast Ballots Online, in Test for Internet Voting
 (WSJ)

In the prime-minister race, Conservative Party wants to make voting more
convenient for its 160,000 eligible members; no U.S. state permits universal
online voting.

Members of the UK's ruling Conservative Party who are voting to decide the
country's next prime minister are for the first time casting ballots online
in a leadership election, a rarity among democracies wary of Internet voting
because of cybersecurity concerns

Over a several-week period, the party is offering Internet voting alongside
voting by mail, in part to provide greater convenience during August weeks
when Britons take vacation and to avoid disruptions by striking postal
workers. The results are to be announced Sept. 5.

The Conservatives are sending qualifying members a ballot pack in the mail
that will include a paper ballot to be returned by mail and information and
security codes for voting online.  ``We recommend online voting where
possible,'' the party states on its website.

The party sought guidance from Britain's National Cyber Security Centre, or
NCSC, and a Tory spokesman said the party was confident the leadership
election would be secure.  ``We have consulted with the NCSC throughout this
process,'' the spokesman said.

Election security analysts fear the system is vulnerable to interference by
hackers.

``We do not have the technology to conduct voting securely online and so it
should not be deployed for high-stakes elections.  And I count this as
rather high stakes,'' said Peter Ryan, a professor of applied security at
the University of Luxembourg.  [...]

https://www.wsj.com/articles/voters-in-u-k-cast-ballots-online-in-test-for-internet-voting-11660993200

  [I expect there will be some attempts to hack into the Conservative Party
  leadership election.  If the software allows write-in votes, the Duke of
  Windsor (Edward VIII), Winston Churchill, and Princess Diana would seem to
  be particularly likely choices, along with some well-known still-active
  athletes -- e.g., David Beckham (soccer) and James Anderson (cricket), and
  a few leading liberals.  Perhaps the Russians will re-use their skills
  that evidently influenced the Brexit election.  We'll have only just a few
  more weeks to find out.  PGN]

Subject: Plane fails to descend as pilots reportedly fell asleep during
 flight (CNN)

Two pilots are believed to have fallen asleep and missed their landing
during a flight from Sudan to Ethiopia on Monday, according to a report by
commercial aviation news site Aviation Herald.
<http://avherald.com/h?article=4fd127fe>

The incident took place on board an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737-800 en
route from Khartoum to Addis Ababa, the report said, "when the pilots fell
asleep" and "the aircraft continued past the top of descent."  Data obtained
by the website indicates that the aircraft was cruising at 37,000 feet on
autopilot when it failed to descend at Addis Ababa Bole International
Airport, its scheduled destination, on August 15.  Air traffic control were
apparently unable to reach the crew despite making several attempts at
contact. However, an alarm was triggered when the plane overshot the runway
and continued along the route.  The aircraft subsequently began to descend,
landing safely around 25 minutes later.

Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data shows the aircraft
overflying the runway, before beginning its descent and maneuvering for
another approach. [...]

Subject: Apple AirTag leads to arrest of airline worker accused of stealing
 at least $15,000 worth of items from luggage (NBC)

Elisha Fieldstadt, NBC News, Aug. 17, 2022, 12:12 PM MDT

  An Apple AirTag led to the arrest of an airline subcontractor accused of
  stealing thousands of dollars' worth of items from luggage at a Florida
  airport.

  Giovanni De Luca, 19, was charged with two counts of grand theft after
  authorities recovered the stolen items from his home, the Okaloosa County
  Sheriffâ€™s Office said in a news release last week.

  Authorities said a traveler reported last month that her luggage never
  made it to her destination. The items inside were worth about $1,600.  She
  said an Apple AirTag, a tracking device that triggers alerts on iPhones,
  iPads and Apple computers, had been in her luggage and showed that it was
  on Kathy Court in Mary Esther, about 50 miles east of Pensacola.

The annual DEF CON hacking conference's "Voting Machine Village," has been a
feature since 2017, with attendees attempting to break into registration
databases, ballot-casting machines, and other voting equipment to identify
vulnerabilities. However, in the wake of the 2020 U.S. presidential election
and the resulting false claims of election fraud, the focus of this year's
event was how to detect vulnerabilities without fueling election
misinformation.  Said Harri Hursti, co-founder of the Voting Machine
Village, "All the security improvements [have been] hampered by all the
false claims, conspiracies--and fighting those." Hursti noted that clips
from DEF CON were used in the media after the election to cast doubt on
election security.  This year's Voting Village featured officials from
Maricopa County, AZ, among others, who discussed ongoing, though debunked,
conspiracy theories. Hursti explained, "What we try to do is to make certain
that the right message gets out."

Another day, another hack -- and another blockchain bridge burned.

When thieves stole an estimated $190 million from U.S. crypto firm Nomad
last week, it was the seventh hack of 2022 to target an increasingly
important cog in the crypto machine: Blockchain "bridges" -- strings of code

Schneier writes:

Earlier this month, I and others wrote a letter to Congress, basically
saying that cryptocurrencies are an complete and total disaster, and urging
them to regulate the space. Nothing in that letter is out of the ordinary,
and is in line with what I wrote about blockchain in 2019. In response,
Matthew Green has written -- not really a rebuttal, but"a general response
to some of the more common spurious objections people make to public
blockchain systems."

In our letter, we write: "By its very design, blockchain technology is
poorly suited for just about every purpose currently touted as a present or
potential source of public benefit. From its inception, this technology has
been a solution in search of a problem and has now latched onto concepts
such as financial inclusion and data transparency to justify its existence,
despite far better solutions to these issues already in use. Despite more
than thirteen years of development, it has severe limitations and design
flaws that preclude almost all applications that deal with public customer
data and regulated financial transactions and are not an improvement on
existing non-blockchain solutions."

 (PSU)

Jessica Hallman, Pennsylvania State University, 11 Aug 2022,
via ACM TechNews, 17 Aug 2022

Researchers at Pennsylvania State University and China's Shandong and
Zhejiang universities found most application programming interfaces (APIs)
using the facial liveness verification detection feature of facial
recognition technology do not always identify deepfakes, and those that can
are less effective than claimed at detecting deepfakes. The researchers
created and used the LiveBugger deepfake-powered attack framework to
evaluate six commercial facial liveness verification APIs. LiveBugger tried
to deceive the APIs using deepfake images and videos from two separate
datasets, and easily bypassed the four most common verification methods. The
researchers proposed strengthening the technology's security by eliminating
verification that only analyzes a static image of a user's face, and by
matching lip movements to a user's voice in dual audio-video analysis
schemes.

Three Nigerian citizens are facing U.S. criminal charges over alleged scams
that targeted construction contractors and public project owners.
Prosecutors say the scams netted nearly $6 million and involved the
defendants posing as five different contractors.  [...]

To carry out the scam, prosecutors say the defendants obtained information
about large construction projects, including the names of project owners,
companies that won contracts and contract dollar amounts.

They then registered website domain names similar to those of actual
contractors. Using email addresses under false names from those domains, the
individuals contacted employees of universities and other public agencies
that had hired the contractors for projects. In the emails, they would
direct the employees to wire a payment to a bank account they controlled.

Shirin Ali, *The Hill*, 17 Aug 2022,
via ACM TechNews, Friday, August 19, 2022

A study of 25 reproductive health apps and wearable devices by researchers
at the Mozilla Foundation found that most have weak privacy protections. The
researchers found that these apps generally collect personal information,
including phone numbers, emails, home addresses, dates of menstrual cycles,
sexual activity, doctors' appointments, and pregnancy symptoms. Of the apps
analyzed, 18 were given a "Privacy Not Included" warning label due to vague
privacy policies and potential security concerns. Additionally, the study
found that most of the apps had vague guidelines regarding data-sharing with
law enforcement. Mozilla's Ashley Boyd warned users that many reproductive
health apps are "riddled with loopholes and they fail to properly secure
intimate data." Only the Euki app was found not to collect any personal
information about users, and any information input by users is stored
locally on the user's device.

Subject: An Explosive New Report Could Upend More than a Decade of
 Alzheimer's Research. How Did This Happen (Mother Jones)

A conversation with reporter Charles Piller, whose recent Science
investigation rocked the research world.

More than 15 years ago, researchers at the University of Minnesota announced
they had made a breakthrough: When they purified a protein from the brains
of genetically modified mice and injected it into rats, it would cause the
rats to develop symptoms similar to Alzheimer's disease in humansÃ¢the first
time anyone had directly linked a substance to the disease. They called this
protein AÎ²*56.

The researchers, along with colleagues from three other universities,
published their findings in *Nature* in 2006. The study has since been cited
about 2,300 times and helped provide the basis of a leading hypothesis about
the cause of Alzheimer's, a disease that currently impacts about 6 million
Americans and their families. Proponents of the hypothesis think that clumps
of amyloid beta protein (AÎ²) in peoples brains may be the primary cause of
Alzheimer's. Since the *Nature* study showed that AÃŽ*56, one form of the
protein, could cause dementia in rats, it seemed to validate the hypothesis.

But now, the accuracy of the *Nature* paper has been called into question.
As documented in an explosive report in Science that published on July 21,
whistleblower Matthew Schrag discovered evidence to suggest that some of the
images at the center of the 2006 paper were tampered with, along with dozens
of other images connected to one of the authors, University of Minnesota
neuroscientist Sylvain LesnÃƒ.

A time honored tradition in many US high schools is for students in their

the presentation and public address systems in his local high school
district outside of Chicago and Rickrolled it. A Rickroll is when a loop of
Rick Astley's 1987 song 'never going to give you up' is played to annoy a
user.

Duong explained that his high school has approximately 2000 students and is
part of a larger school district in suburban Chicago, which has six high
schools in total.

"Like any hacker wannabe, I started running scans against my school
network," Duong said.

company cited an anonymous researcher as the flaws' discoverer, without

existence of similarly serious flaws, and expressed awareness that such
vulnerabilities had been exploited on perhaps a dozen occasions by

Zero-day vulnerabilities are security flaws known by attackers or
researchers before the software vendor has become aware or been able to

Microsoft software engineer Raymond Chen said a sound frequency in Janet
Jackson's song "Rhythm Nation" could crash a model 5400rpm laptop hard drive
used in certain Windows XP notebooks. A laptop maker alerted Microsoft's
Windows team to the problem, which seemed to occur when the song's music
video played on the laptops. However, the video also would crash Windows
laptops produced by the manufacturer's competitors, and Chen blogged,
"Playing the music video on one laptop caused a laptop sitting nearby to
crash, even though that other laptop wasn't playing the video!" Microsoft
determined the song had a frequency that matched the laptop hard drive's
natural resonant frequency, which caused its moving disks to over-vibrate
and induce a crash. Chen said the laptop manufacturer put a custom filter in
the device's audio system that could eliminate the resonant frequency during
audio playback.

Subject: Re: Meta finds new way of tracking users across websites (The Guardian)

Quote from the Guardian article:

"The two apps have been taking advantage of the fact that users who click on
links are taken to webpages in an in-app browser, controlled by Facebook
Instagram, rather than sent to the user's web browser of choice, such as
Safari or Firefox."

As a longtime Firefox user and Chrome hater, I am pleased to see Chrome
omitted as an example of a "web browser of choice."
