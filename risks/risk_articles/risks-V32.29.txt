Subject: Tesla network outage -- massive (Electrek and The Sun)

*TESLA's network completely dropped in a massive outage on Wednesday that
left drivers unable to connect to their cars.*

According to Electrek, internal systems were fully down and around 11am ET,
users couldn't connect their vehicles to the mobile app.

<https://electrek.co/2020/09/23/tesla-suffers-complete-network-outage-internal-systems-and-connectivity-features-down/>

The outage -- which appeared to be global -- is said to be one of the "most
wide-ranging" in Tesla's history...

https://www.the-sun.com/news/1521051/tesla-network-outage-down-elon-musk-cars-connectivity/

Connectivity was reportedly returning for some users' cars.

5G Wireless May Lead to Inaccurate Weather Forecasts
Rutgers Today, 24 Sep 2020 via AM TechNews 25 Sep 2020

A study by Rutgers University researchers found upcoming 5G wireless
networks that expedite cellphone service may lead to inaccurate weather
forecasts. Signals from 5G frequency bands could leak into the band used by
weather sensors on satellites that quantify atmospheric water vapor. The
Rutgers team used computer modeling to examine the impact of unintended 5G
leakage into an adjacent frequency band in predicting the 2008 Super Tuesday
Tornado Outbreak in the South and Midwestern regions of the U.S. The
modeling found 5G leakage of -15 to -20 decibel Watts impacted the accuracy
of rainfall forecasting by up to 0.9 millimeters during the tornado
outbreak, and also affected forecasting of temperatures near ground level by
up to 2.34 degrees Fahrenheit. Rutgers' Narayan B. Mandayam said, "If we
want leakage to be at levels preferred by the 5G community, we need to work
on more detailed models as well as antenna technology, dynamic reallocation
of spectrum resources, and improved weather forecasting algorithms that can
take into account 5G leakage."

Subject: Major Instagram App Bug Could've Given Hackers Remote Access to
  Your Phone (The Hacker News)

Ever wonder how hackers can hack your smartphone remotely?

In a report shared with The Hacker News today, Check Point researchers
disclosed details about a *critical vulnerability*
<https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2020-1895> in Instagram's
Android app that could have allowed remote attackers to take control over a
targeted device just by sending victims a specially crafted image.

What's more worrisome is that the flaw not only lets attackers perform
actions on behalf of the user within the Instagram app -- including spying
on victim's private messages and even deleting or posting photos from their
accounts -- but also execute arbitrary code on the device.

According to an *advisory*
<https://m.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2020-1895> published by
Facebook, the heap overflow security issue (tracked as CVE-2020-1895, CVSS
score: 7.8) impacts all versions of the Instagram app prior to
128.0.0.26.128, which was released on February 10 earlier this year.

"This [flaw] turns the device into a tool for spying on targeted users
without their knowledge, as well as enabling malicious manipulation of their
Instagram profile," Check Point Research said in *an analysis published
today.
<https://blog.checkpoint.com/2020/09/24/instahack-how-researchers-were-able-to-take-over-the-instagram-app-using-a-malicious-image/>*

"In either case, the attack could lead to a massive invasion of users'
privacy and could affect reputations -- or lead to security risks that are
even more serious."

After the findings were reported to Facebook, the social media company
addressed the issue with a patch update released six months ago. The public
disclosure was delayed all this time to allow the majority of Instagram's
users to update the app, thereby mitigating the risk this vulnerability may
introduce.

Although Facebook confirmed there were no signs that this bug was exploited
globally, the development is another reminder of why it's essential to keep
apps up to date and be mindful of the permissions granted to them.  A Heap
Overflow Vulnerability.  [...]

Subject: Tribune staff furious as cybersecurity test email makes cruel
  promises (WashPost)

Source: https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2020/09/23/tribune-bonus-email-phishing-hoax/

"Employees of the Tribune Publishing Company were momentarily thrilled
Wednesday after they received a company email announcing that they were each
getting a bonus of up to $10,000, to 'thank you for your ongoing commitment
to excellence.'

To see how big their bonus would be, they just had to click on a link that's
well, that's when they learned they had failed the test.  This test ran into
a history of furloughs and layoffs, and thus created considerable anger
amongst staff.

This leads to a number of interesting questions:

1.  Employees: given this history, just how likely was the contents of that
email?  The fact that many clicked illustrated that a phishing campaign
using this exact contents for real *would have worked*.  This is PRECISELY
how such scams work.

2.  If the case of a real email hoax or phishing attempt, who would the
staff have blamed for the consequences such as ransomware shutting the
company down and potentially causing even more layoffs?  I assume the wrath
would than go to the people who did this test?

3.  What else could this company have done to prove this point?

There is not enough information to assess if the company ran a staff security awareness training beforehand, but it certainly appears to be required.

Subject: UK COVID-19 test booking website bugs tell some user no test slots
  are available (Schools Week)

https://schoolsweek.co.uk/anger-as-government-admits-test-and-trace-website-coding-error/

This article has a good description of the bug(s), but the implication (that
some infected people were being told there were no test slots available)
have not, as far as I can tell, been explored in depth by mainstream media.

It seems to me that if even a modest number of infected people were turned
away and were not subsequently tested then there is a very good chance that
a few generations of contacts down the track some infected patients will
inevitably die.  To me this means that the software defect was a material
factor in loss of human life.

The article contains an analysis of testing by Adam Leon Smith, chair of the
software testing specialist group of British Computer Society, The Chartered
Institute for IT.  I'm reading between the lines when I suggest that it
sounds like this part of the web was basically untested.

There have been other articles in the press following up the connection with
Deloitte, apparently the prime contractor for the testing service, but none
I could find had the detail of this description.

I have not fact checked the linked article.

Subject: Pandemic spurs journalists to go it alone via email (Axios)

A slew of high-profile journalists have recently announced they are leaving
newsrooms to launch their own, independent brands, mostly via email
newsletters.

Context: Many of those writers, working with new technology companies like
Substack, TinyLetter, Lede, or Ghost, have made the transition amid the
pandemic.

   - The pandemic strained the finances of traditional newsrooms and
   publications and sent most journalists to work from home.

   - "I think many people in the journalism world saw how quickly their
   business fortunes can change during COVID and decided they would rather
   run their own business as opposed to be dependent on another businesses'
   ebbs and flows," says Alex Kantrowitz, former Buzzfeed reporter turned
   author of the Big Technology newsletter on Substack.
   <https://bigtechnology.substack.com/>

Driving the news: Several prominent businesses and technology or political
journalists have left their news companies to launch their own newsletters,
including:

   - Alex Kantrowitz (formerly of Buzzfeed), Casey Newton (formerly of The
   Verge), Josh Constine (formerly of TechCrunch), Andrew Sullivan (formerly
   of New York Magazine), Emily Atkin (formerly of The New Republic), Anne
   Helen Petersen (formerly of Buzzfeed) and Matt Taibbi, (formerly of
   Rolling Stone).

   - They join a wider cohort of journalists and pundits that have started
   independent newsletters in the past few years, including Ben Thompson
   (Stratechery <https://stratechery.com/>) and Bill Bishop (Sinocism
   <https://sinocism.com/>).

Subject: Re: Old TV caused village broadband outages for 18 months
  (BBC, RISKS-32.29)

A longer article on the matter included the following:

  "However, despite Openreach's triumphant claims, villagers
   including Mr and Mrs Rees's own son, Aled, insisted yesterday
   that their Internet problems persisted, long after the offending
   television had been scrapped.

Aled Rees told The Telegraph: ``This Mr Jones must be smoking something
funny if he thinks it's got anything to do with the TV.  My parents had only
had the TV a few months.  The problems in the village had been going on for
much longer than that and are continuing today, even after they got rid of
the TV.

``I've no idea why Openreach are saying this -- they've got to blame
somebody and they're not going to blame themselves.''

Eirian Hughes, 63, said: ``This story is just a smokescreen, and the fact
is, it's costing too much to connect to fibre. The broadband service is
rubbish.''

Farmer Geraint Jones, 60, said the connection speed was still ``worse than
appalling.''

An Openreach spokesman said: ``It's true to say the villagers were already
having to put up with broadband on an old slower copper network -- but the
faulty TV was clearly interfering with the existing service and we're
delighted to have solved that particular mystery.

``We're pleased to say the village is now in line to be upgraded imminently
to superfast broadband which will improve matters even more.''

I think the last statement might be more than a little suggestive.

If you have GPS coordinates, device details and query strings, it should be
possible to de-anonymize quite a lot of that database using other
sources. Even more risky (perhaps) is the possibility that de-anonymization
would be mistaken (e.g. as a result of GPS margin of error). For a
surveillance state this is particularly pernicious because of the habit
search engines now have of putting additional words in their users' search
boxes. So someone might get tagged for a search they didn't even
intentionally make.

Subject: Re: D.C.'s New Area Code Will Be... 771 (RISKS-32.28)

This is pretty impressive considering that there are over 7 million numbers
allocated to 202, and only about 1.2 million people who live or work in the
District. When I look at tables that show what numbers are allocated to what
carriers, I see vast ranges to mobile carriers and to CLECs, who now mostly
provide VoIP numbers. So perhaps there are a few people who want cool 202
numbers even though they really live somewhere else.

>... I wonder how many area codes NANPA ... when we'll need four-digit area
>codes. Or hexadecimal >phone keypads, or phone numbers including */#. (Yes,
>latter two are jokes -- mostly)

You don't have to guess, it's on their web site:

https://www.nationalnanpa.com/reports/April_2020_NANP_Exhaust_Analysis%20Final.pdf

Based on current trends, it will be later than 2050 which is as far away as
their models go. There was a burst of demand when mobile phones were new,
and when CLECs were setting up modem banks. (At the time they had to
allocate a 10,000 number block even if the CLEC only needed a handful of
numbers, a problem since fixed.) But things have slowed down a lot since
everyone now has a phone, and modems are found only in burglar alarms and
history museums.  -- Regards, John Levine, johnl@taugh.com, Primary

Subject: Re: UK Companies House (Stein, RISKS-32.28)

> "The UK's Companies House comprises a core system of record that
> authenticates business ownership and persons of significant control (PSC)
> -- corporate directors."

There are two things wrong with this statement. First, the main point of
Companies House is to incorporate and dissolve limited companies. The system
of record is its second task. From its Website: "We incorporate and dissolve
limited companies. We register company information and make it available to
the public." https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house

Second, PSCs are not necessarily directors. Directors of a limited company
have always been a part of the publicly-available company record held by
Companies House.  The introduction of the category of PSC and the legal
requirement for their public identification in April 2016 is a significant
part of enhanced UK company transparency. Germany, a country with a
reputation for careful control of companies, does not (yet) require a
declaration of PSCs.

PSCs are people (real people, not just legal individuals) who:

* Directly or indirectly hold more than 25% of the shares (all UK limited
  companies issue shares; that is how a company is owned); or
* Directly or indirectly hold more than 25% of the voting rights; or
* Directly or indirectly hold the right to appoint or remove a majority of
  directors; or
* Otherwise have the right to exercise, or actually exercising, significant
  influence or control; or
* Have the right to exercise, or actually exercise, significant influence or
  control over the activities of a trust or firm which is not a legal
  entity, but would itself satisfy any of the first four conditions if it
  were an individual.  (See, for example,
  https://www.waterfront.law/blog/persons-of-significant-control )

I think it would enhance any country's transparency about companies to have
a requirement for identifying PSCs. The report on the UK Government
consultation on how to enhance company transparency further, referenced by
Stein, does show that a requirement for identifying PSCs is not enough.

I will note that the previously-booming London property market has long been
recognised as an area in which large amounts of money are thought to be
*laundered*, and that market has nothing to do with Companies House.

Disclosure: I am majority owner and Director of a UK company registered at
Companies House, and I am CEO ("Gesch\344ftsf\374hrer") of a German
company fully owned by the English one.
