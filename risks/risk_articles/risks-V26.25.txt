Subject: Health information technology risks

Since the ECRI Institute recently moved health IT to its 'top 10 list' of
hazardous healthcare technologies for 2011, I thought I would offer this
case in point.

Shortly before midnight on a Monday evening, a large urban academic medical
center suffered a major IT system crash which disabled virtually all IT
functionality for the entire campus and regional outpatient clinics.  The
outage affected ADT, financial, medical records, laboratory ordering and
reporting, imaging ordering and reporting, and pharmacy systems.  (Two
semi-independent subsystems, EKG, and picture archiving, were still
functional in a limited sense).  The outage persisted for 67 hours, and
forced the cancelation of all elective procedures on Wednesday and Thursday,
involving 52 major procedures and numerous minor procedures (such as
colonoscopies).  All ambulance traffic was diverted to other hospitals
during the outage (estimated 70 diversions).  There were substantial delays
in obtaining laboratory and radiology results on existing inpatients, so
despite the reduction in the numbers of incoming patients, it was difficult
to clear out the hospital as physicians delayed discharges pending those
results.  Not surprising to the readers of RISKS, the outage was due to a
concatenation of small failures and long-standing but unapparent underlying
latent conditions.  The triggering event was a hardware failure in a
critical network component.  This was repaired but required major servers to
be manually restarted.  During restart, the servers halted and reported
critical errors; it was then discovered that certain file permissions had
been changed that prevented the clinical systems from rebooting, and
operators from reverting to prior versions.  (It should be noted that these
systems had not been rebooted for over 26 months).  Ultimately it was found
that these changes resulted from an attempt to install "high availability"
failover capability two years prior.  The high availability project had been
plagued with problems from the start, and eventually was halted prior to
completion, but some changes that had been made were never completely rolled
back, unknown to the system's managers.  These changes, in the presence of
the network fault, had the effect of triggering an attempt to execute high
availability failover processes that were nonexistent and thus led to the
reboot failures.  Once this issue was discovered and corrected, clinical
servers could be restarted.  The databases then underwent extensive
integrity checks, and when these were satisfactory, services were resumed on
Friday at 1600.  Backloading the clinical and financial data accumulated
during the outage took considerably longer than the downtime did.  There was
no evidence this event was due to external agency, malware, hacking, etc.
Interestingly, no pre-existing data were lost during the crash and downtime.
A previous risk analysis had estimated direct costs for complete downtime at
$56,000 per hour, so the total direct cost (not including lost revenue from

canceled cases or diverted patients) is likely close to $4 million.  As far
as is known, no patients were injured during this event.  The risks here are
multiple, but a few salient point are worth emphasizing.  First, it was
difficult initially for frontline workers to convince help desk personnel
that the system was unavailable due to the partitioning of the network
secondary to the initiating hardware failure.  Second, it was difficult to
understand the nature of the failure or to uncover the ultimate cause of the
event.  Third, the organization was slow in activating its own internal
disaster plan - an incident management group was not convened until 1530
Tuesday, roughly 16 hours into the incident.  Fourth, the social element of
the sociotechnical system that is a hospital was able to quickly reorganize
in multiple ways and keep essential services operating in at least some
fashion for the duration.  Many of these adaptations were made "on the fly";
one of the most interesting was rescheduling financial staff (who now had
nothing to do, since no bills could be produced), using them as runners to
move orders, materials, and results around the organization.  Fifth, as has
been frequently noted in RISKS, maintenance played an important part in this
failure.  The irony of the role of "high availability" resulting in
unavailability is rich indeed.  Sixth, as Richard Cook has pointed out, a
working system, even with known flaws, is a precious resource, so the
reluctance to ever submit to a full restart over the course of two years,
which included multiple large and small maintenance downtimes, is
understandable, even though that might have identified problems like the
undocumented permission and script changes at a time when they might have
been more easily recognized and corrected.  As more and more care delivery
organizations with little experience in managing clinical, as opposed to
business, systems install more and more advanced, clinical HIT systems --
systems that have not been developed from a safety-critical computing
viewpoint -- more frequent and potentially more consequential failures are
likely.

Federal Court: E-Mail Entitled To Fourth Amendment Protection
Doug Mataconis, 14 Dec 2010

In what could turn out to be a landmark case, a three-judge panel of the
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that e-mail held on an ISP server is
subject to the protections of the Fourth Amendment:

In a landmark decision issued today in the criminal appeal of
U.S. v. Warshak, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that the
government must have a search warrant before it can secretly seize and
search e-mails stored by e-mail service providers. Closely tracking arguments
made by EFF in its amicus brief, the court found that e-mail users have the
same reasonable expectation of privacy in their stored e-mail as they do in
their phone calls and postal mail.

EFF filed a similar amicus brief with the 6th Circuit in 2006 in a civil
suit brought by criminal defendant Warshak against the government for its
warrantless seizure of his e-mails. There, the 6th Circuit agreed with EFF
that e-mail users have a Fourth Amendment-protected expectation of privacy in
the e-mail they store with their e-mail providers, though that decision was
later vacated on procedural grounds. Warshak's appeal of his criminal
conviction has brought the issue back to the Sixth Circuit, and once again
the court has agreed with EFF and held that e-mail users have a Fourth
Amendment-protected reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of
their e-mail accounts.

From the decision:

E-Mail is the technological scion of tangible mail, and it plays an
indispensable part in the Information Age. Over the last decade, e-mail has
become ``so pervasive that some persons may consider [it] to be [an]
essential means or necessary instrument[] for self-expression, even
self-identification.''  Quon, 130 S. Ct. at 2630. It follows that e-mail
requires strong protection under the Fourth Amendment; otherwise, the Fourth
Amendment would prove an ineffective guardian of private communication, an
essential purpose it has long been recognized to serve. See
U.S. Dist. Court, 407 U.S. at 313; United States v. Waller, 581 F.2d 585,
587 (6th Cir. 1978) (noting the Fourth Amendment's role in protecting
private communications). As some forms of communication begin to diminish,
the Fourth Amendment must recognize and protect nascent ones that arise. See
Warshak I, 490 F.3d at 473 (``It goes without saying that like the
telephone earlier in our history, e-mail is an ever-increasing mode of
private communication, and protecting shared communications through this
medium is as important to Fourth Amendment principles today as protecting
telephone conversations has been in the past.''

If we accept that an e-mail is analogous to a letter or a phone call, it is
manifest that agents of the government cannot compel a commercial ISP to
turn over the contents of an e-mail without triggering the Fourth
Amendment. An ISP is the intermediary that makes e-mail communication
possible. E-Mails must pass through an ISP's servers to reach their intended
recipient. Thus, the ISP is the functional equivalent of a post office or a
telephone company. As we have discussed above, the police may not storm the
post office and intercept a letter, and they are likewise forbidden from
using the phone system to make a clandestine recording of a telephone call
-- unless they get a warrant, that is. See Jacobsen, 466 U.S. at 114; Katz,
389 U.S. at 353. It only stands to reason that, if government agents compel
an ISP to surrender the contents of a subscriber's e-mails, those agents
have thereby conducted a Fourth Amendment search, which necessitates
compliance with the warrant requirement absent some exception.

Given the fundamental similarities between e-mail and traditional forms of
communication [like postal mail and telephone calls], it would defy common
sense to afford e-mails lesser Fourth Amendment protection. It follows that
e-mail requires strong protection under the Fourth Amendment; otherwise the
Fourth Amendment would prove an ineffective guardian of private
communication, an essential purpose it has long been recognized to
serve.   [T]he police may not storm the post office and intercept a
letter, and they are likewise forbidden from using the phone system to make
a clandestine recording of a telephone call ``unless they get a
warrant, that is. It only stands to reason that, if government agents compel
an ISP to surrender the contents of a subscriber's e-mails, those
agents have thereby conducted a Fourth Amendment search, which necessitates
compliance with the warrant requirement.''

In the case at hand, which involved a criminal fraud prosecution of the
owners of the company that sold the male enhancement produce Enzyte, the
Court went on to find that the facts indicated that a good faith exception
existed to the failure to obtain a warrant for the search at issue. As a
result, the criminal convictions were sustained. Nonetheless, the
Court's finding that the Fourth Amendment's protections
extend to e-mail kept on a third-party server stands and given the prevalence
of web-based e-mail today, it's an important one as
well. Conceptually, there doesn't seem to be any reason why an e-mail
provider like, say, Google, should be treated any differently than a
delivery service or a post office. The expectations of privacy of the
average citizen are similar, and the fact that someone chooses to store
e-mail on a web server rather than downloading it doesn't strike me
as a relevant distinction for 4th Amendment purposes. Besides, the idea that
the Federal Government would be able to access electronic mail without any
need for a showing of probable cause that a crime has been committed strikes
me as so offensive to American concepts of liberty that the outcome here
seems rather self-evident.

But, of course, nothing in the law is self-evident. This holding only
applies in the Sixth Circuit for the moment and it will be up to other
courts across the country to apply the holding. Hopefully, they'll
do the right thing.

You can read the full opinion here, but be warned that it's long (98
pages) and much of it deals with issues unrelated to the Fourth Amendment
ruling.

Subject: WikiLeaks

Joby Warrick; Rob Pegoraro, WikiLeaks Avoids Shutdown as Supporters
Worldwide Go on the Offensive *The Washington Post* 8 Dec 2010
[Culled from ACM TechNews, 10 Dec 2010 by PGN]

The resilience of WikiLeaks despite attempts to shut it down is a testament
to the extreme difficulty governments face in their attempts to control the
Internet.  "The Internet is an extremely open system with very low barriers
to access and use," says Google's Vint Cerf.  "The ease of moving digital
information around makes it very difficult to suppress once it is
accessible."  When WikiLeaks was blocked from using its primary Internet
host, it shifted to another, while the number of mirror WikiLeaks sites
exploded to more than 1,000.  Concurrently, angry WikiLeaks' advocates are
launching attacks against sites that have severed ties to the group.
WikiLeaks was targeted for shutdown because it disclosed sensitive
U.S. diplomatic cables, but over the past week it has continued to publish
them online, defying efforts to impede its access to funding and Web
resources.  WikiLeaks' lack of a central headquarters makes it immune to
legal and political pressure, while outsiders' closure attempts are
complicated by the organization's multi-continental Web infrastructure.
"Something that's illegal in some countries but not others is very hard to
keep off the Net, even though there's been some success in keeping it out of
the countries where it's illegal," notes Internet Systems Consortium
president Paul Vixie.

  [This is a huge topic for discussion, and generating all sorts of
  controversy on all sides -- e.g., claims of overly aggressive government
  actions trying to hide embarrassment, attempts to take down WikiLeaks
  providers including widespread mirrors, overly aggressive retaliations by
  those supportive of open information, denying government jobs to anyone
  who had accessed WikiLeaks, and so on.  Rational thought once again leads
  to interesting conclusions such as natural consequences of overclassifying
  information, the use of system-high security in which any authorized user
  has almost total access within some domain without need to know, many
  fundamental weaknesses in system, network, and human trustworthiness, the
  need for whistle-blowers and the realistic impossibility of guaranteeing
  them protection, and so on.  This is a complicated issue, and probably not
  one ongoing discussions in RISKS can grapple with adequately.  But so be
  it: let the wild rumpus roar, as it may.  PGN]

Vinyl and analog tapes last forever, but hard drives fail and digital
formats change, 7 Dec 2010

Last year, the Beggars Banquet label unearthed the multitrack master
recordings of the Cult's classic 1985 album, Love, for a planned deluxe
edition. The LP was an early digital recording, and to the label's shock,
one master was unplayable; the other contained only 80 percent of the
album. "That's the problem with digital," says Steve Webbon, head archivist
of the Beggars Group. "When it goes, it's just blank. It's gone."

Subject: Massive Gawker Media security breach

A massive Gawker Media security breach was recently disclosed. The
usernames, e-mails and (poorly, 1DES) encrypted passwords of about 1.5
million Gawker-hosted Web sites (e.g., Lifehacker, Gizmodo, Gawker, Jezebel,
io9, Jalopnik, Kotaku, Deadspin, Fleshbot, the old Consumerist, and any
other defunct sites previously hosted by Gawker), along with Gawker source
code and a bunch of other goodies, were stolen and published onto the
Internet.

Here's the party line from Gawker: http://lifehacker.com/5712785/

Here's a much more detailed and comprehensive analysis from The Firewall
security blog on forbes.com:
http://blogs.forbes.com/firewall/2010/12/13/the-lessons-of-gawkers-security-mess/

There's one more twist that some people may be unaware of (either because
not everyone was sent the e-mail message I'm about to describe, or because
their spam filters blocked it). A stealth-mode startup calling itself "Hint"
sent out e-mail messages to an undetermined number of the people whose
information was compromised which read as follows:

  Hi there,

  Hint wanted to let you know that your e-mail address and password that you
  used to signup for Gawker (or one of its sites) were hacked. Forbes'
  coverage is at
  http://blogs.forbes.com/kashmirhill/2010/12/12/gawker-gets-hacked-by-gnosis/

  In situations like this, time is of the essence, which is why we were
  surprised & shocked to find that Gawker Media hadn't taken the initiative
  to notify you of this privacy breach immediately. We HIGHLY recommend you
  change all of your online passwords as a precaution.

  -The Team at Hint (http://www.hint.io)
  (This is a one time e-mail)

This notification was problematic in a number of ways:

 * The links in it (which I haven't shown above) are obfuscated
   tracking links pointing back at email.hint.io.
 * As far as I can tell, Hint has nothing whatsoever to do with
   Gawker, and the e-mail message offers no explanation for why it's
   appropriate for Hint, in particular, to be sending out this
   notification.
 * Hint is apparently a stealth-mode start-up whose Web sites reveals
   nothing substantive about what it is doing or when it will be
   going live with whatever is doing, so there's no way to verify the
   authenticity of the message.
 * If you look in the headers of the e-mail message, it claims to have
   originated at "matthew-gagnons-macbook-pro.local". According to
   LinkedIn, Matthew Gagnon is affiliated with Hint, and one of his
   LinkedIn recommendations there even makes reference to the MacBook
   Pro being his platform of choice, so it would seem that the
   references to Hint in the message legitimate. I doubt Mr. Gagnon
   wanted to reveal himself in this way as the sender of the message,
   though. Perhaps the folks at Hint have some work to do on their
   software to prevent inadvertent privacy breaches like this one.
 * I can't help but suspect that whatever Hint is getting ready to go
   public with may compete with Gawker. If so, then it looks to be in
   rather poor taste for them to be the ones broadcasting Gawker's
   screw-up, as bad as it may be.

For those who are curious, I've posted on my blog
(http://blog.kamens.us/?p=1946) some advice to Hint for what they should do
the next time they take it upon themselves to notify >1 million users that
some other site they use has been compromised.

A new iPhone App with the misleading name 'PatriotApp' attempts to draw on

snitch network.

You might think an app with such a patriotic name might have useful
functions like a pocket constitution or quotes from our forefathers.  But
contrary to the services one might expect, this app allows users to report
any 'suspicious' behavior directly linking them with top government

Much like the new DHS program 'If you see something, say something' this app

Subject: "Security seals" on websites

Recently, I've noticed a lot of websites adding "security seals" --
basically an image link -- to their SSL-enabled pages.  An example is near
the bottom of the dabs.com account sign-in page:
<https://www.dabs.com/AccountLogin.aspx>.

These usually link to the website of the SSL certificate issuer, and provide
some basic information about the website and the company, such as name and
address.

The risk here is that if users begin to rely on these "seals" instead of the
SSL indication in their browser (lock icon, address bar, etc.), fraudulent
sites could provide seals that purport to verify their own identity, and
trick users into believing they are the real "dabs.com" (or whatever).

Subject: Re: Risk of RISKS and short URLs? (Chris D., RISKS-26.23)

It is worth pointing out that many link shorteners offer ways to show what
the link points to, in order to avoid this problem.

For bit.ly, it's easy, just add a + (plus) to the end of the link, hence
http://bit.ly/deUpGb+ . For tinyurl.com links, add the subdomain preview,
hence http://tinyurl.com/376q3vf becomes http://preview.tinyurl.com/376q3vf
(and you will see that this link is quite safe). It stands to reason that
goo.gl would offer similar functionality.

Admittedly, this does assume that you (know how to) edit the address bar
manually, which is inconceivable to 99.99% of the population. In that
respect, tinyurl.com gets it right since, for the price of a locally-stored
cookie, the service will preview by default every single tinyurl.com link
that comes your way.
