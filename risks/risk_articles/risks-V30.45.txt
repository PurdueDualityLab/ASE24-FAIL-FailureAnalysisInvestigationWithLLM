Subject: How Russian & Alt-Right Twitter Accounts Worked Together to Skew 
  the Narrative About Berkeley (Caroline O.) 

#Antifa and #Berkeley were hot topics last weekend in America and in Russia. 
Caroline O., Medium, 1 Sep 2017 
https://medium.com/@RVAwonk/how-russian-alt-right-twitter-accounts-worked-together-to-skew-the-narrative-about-berkeley-f03a3d04ac5d 

Social media [sic] has an important role in shaping perceptions of current 
events, as well as influencing mainstream news coverage of those events. 
Platforms like Twitter provide real-time access to events going on around 
the world, allowing anyone to get a front-row seat for breaking news.  But 
as much as it has opened up new channels of information, social media has 
also open ed up new avenues for manipulating perceptions of reality. 
Misinformation and disinformation often spread faster than the truth, and by 
the time the narrative is corrected, social media has already moved on to 
the next big thing. 

The narrative surrounding last weekend's protests in Berkeley took shape on 
social media and was picked up, at least in part, by mainstream news 
outlets.  The result was a skewed presentation of events that was almost 
entirely devoid of the context in which they took place. Even more 
troubling: that narrative was influenced by pro-Russian social media 
networks, including state-sponsored propaganda outlets, botnets, cyborgs, 
and individual users. 

In the case study below, I describe how the narrative surrounding Berkeley 
was picked up and shaped by Russian-linked influence networks, which saw a 
chance to drive a wedge in American society and ran with it. Next, I look at 
the individual accounts and users that were identified as top influencers on 
Twitter, and explore what they were posting, how they worked together to 
craft a narrative, and the methods they used to amplify their message. 
Finally, I look at how news coverage of the events in Berkeley was shaped by 
the skewed narrative that emerged on social media. 

This is just a single case study in a larger story, but it serves as an 
important reminder that Russia is still exploiting social media to harm 
U.S. interests -- and that plenty of Americans are willing to join in on the 
effort. 

The Russian Connection 

Russian-linked influence networks and propaganda arms quickly took interest 
in the Berkeley protests last weekend. On Sunday afternoon, the top story on 
the front page of Russian propaganda outlet RT was about the events in 
Berkeley.  (Note that this was the main landing page, not the America 
section). 

RT tweeted stories about the protests throughout the day Sunday (and some on 
Saturday), posting dramatic images and using trending hashtags to maximize 
their reach. Many of these tweets were retweeted by the semi-automated 
pro-Kremlin account @TeamTrumpRussia [...,] which spent much of the day 
amplifying the hashtags #Berkeley and #Antifa. 

On Twitter, the hashtag #Berkeley was amplified by Russian-linked influence 
networks, as evidenced by the output of the Hamilton 68 dashboard, a project 
of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, which tracks the activity of 600 
Twitter accounts linked to Russian influence operations. These include 
state-sponsored propaganda outlets like Sputnik and RT, as well as 
individual users, automated accounts (bots), and cyborgs (accounts that 
produce automated content some of the time, but are human-controlled at 
other times) that actively and frequently amplify Kremlin propaganda 
(knowingly, and in some cases, potentially unknowingly).

  Third-Party Data Leak (Gizmodo) 

via NNSquad 
http://gizmodo.com/millions-of-time-warner-customer-records-exposed-in-thi-1798701579 

  The files, more than 600GB in size, were discovered on August 24 by the 
  Kromtech Security Center while its researchers were investigating an 
  unrelated data breach at World Wrestling Entertainment. Two Amazon S3 
  buckets were eventually found and linked to BroadSoft, a global 
  communications company that partners with service providers, including 
  AT&T and TWC. The 4 million TWC records are not all tied to unique 
  customers, meaning 4 million individual people were not exposed by the 
  breach. Due to the sheer size of the cache, it was not immediately clear 
  precisely how subscribers were affected. The leaked data included 
  usernames, emails addresses, MAC addresses, device serial numbers, and 
  financial transaction information--though it does not appear that any 
  Social Security numbers or credit card information was exposed. Time 
  Warner Cable was purchased by Charter Communications last year and is now 
  called Spectrum, though the leaked records date back from this year to at 
  least 2010.

Subject: Hacking Retail Gift Cards Remains Scarily Easy (WiReD) 

In November of 2015, Will Caput worked for a security firm assigned to a 
penetration test of a major Mexican restaurant chain, scouring its websites 
for hackable vulnerabilities. So when 40-year-old Caput took a lunch break, 
he had beans and guacamole on his mind. He decided to drive to the local 
branch of the restaurant in Chico, California. While there, still in the 
mindset of testing the restaurant's security, he noticed a tray of 
unactivated gift cards sitting on the counter. So he grabbed them all -- the 
cashier didn't mind, since customers can load them with a credit card from 
home via the web -- and sat down at a table, examining the stack as he ate 
his vegetarian burrito. 

As he flipped through the gift cards, he noticed a pattern. While the final 
four digits of the cards seemed to vary randomly, the rest remained constant 
except one digit that appeared to increase by one with every card he 
examined, neatly ticking up like a poker straight. By the time he finished 
his burrito, he had a plan to defraud the system.

It looks to me as if fingerprint scanners would be just as convenient to use 
as waving an embedded chip, offer better affordance (you can see what to put 
where), and are a *lot* cheaper than embedded chips.  Near as I can make out 
from the IT Professionals NZ code of ethics, this is unethical.

While I agree that chipping yourself is a bad idea, this is not why. 

Chips used for financial transactions don't just broadcast an account 
number, they sign transactions.  Hence a spy can replay a transaction but it 
can't create new ones.  Contact and contactless EMV chips have worked this 
way for 20 years.  Banks can certainly be stupid but they're not quite 
*that* stupid.

On the contrary. If you have the right to repair your device on your own 
initiative, you can always choose to go to a repair shop *you* trust, or 
even do it yourself. If you do not have that right, you *must* go to the 
official dealer -- who may not be trustworthy. 

Right To Repair is not only important to cheapskates, researchers, hobbyists 
and mafiosi in the Western world, but also to "terrorists" (read: 
non-conformists) in more dictatorial countries. Those may not be right to 
assume that an official Apple repair shop in *cough*Insert Undemocratic 
Country Apple Has Close Ties With Here*cough* will supply the same, 
spyware-free* replacement part that we get in Europe. And that may happen 
with or without Apple's support, or even knowledge.

Subject: Re: Is LIBOR, Benchmark for Trillions of Dollars in Transactions, a 
  Lie? (Shapir, RISKS-30.44) 

I am afraid that Amos Shapir is in error when he refers to the wording on 
British one pound banknotes, or indeed any British banknote issued by the 
Bank of England since 1853. 

The wording was just: "I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of 
...". There was no mention of the means by which that would be achieved. 

It is possible that wording which included the means of payment might have 
appeared on bank notes issued by other than the "Old Lady of Threadneedle 
Street", but the last notes issued by a private bank in England and Wales 
were b y Fox, Fowler and Co in 1921, and their notes did not carry such 
wording. 

Further, since 1694 although with some breaks, and until 1931 when Britain 
left the "Gold Standard" and the notes became backed by securities, the 
means of settlement was gold, not silver; in the form of a gold sovereign. 

The gold sovereign began circulation in 1489 as the "English gold sovereign" 
, but which was last minted in 1604.  The 'modern' gold sovereign was minted 
from 1817 until withdrawal in 1932. 

Guinea coins were also issued - a "guinea" being one pound and one shilling 
(one pound and five pence in decimal coinage) - but not guinea notes.  The 
guinea was last minted in 1816, but the reference value is still used in 
horse racing (the "Two Thousand Guineas Stakes" run at Newmarket in 
April/May) and d in the market sale of sheep. 

I would add for RISKS readers' further information, that "sterling" derives 
from the silver pennies introduced after 1066 by the Norman invaders (from 
one of whom, Grimbaldus, I am descended).  Then, 240 sterlings weighed one 
pound, hence 240 (later, copper) pennies to the "pound".  The shilling, of 
which there were 20 in a pound (and therefore 12 pennies to the shilling) 
was also introduced by William the Conquerer.  There's logic behind our old 
currency. 

Of course, gold and silver coins would wear away with handling, and since 
their value was based on weight, they were not really practical as a coinage 
in common and frequent use, and so were replaced by cupronickel and other 
alloy facsimiles.
