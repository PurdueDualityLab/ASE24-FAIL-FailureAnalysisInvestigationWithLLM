Man arrested for theft of "9 million files" said to comprise identity data
for roughly 2/3 of the Greek population.

http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1290410

I suppose this is the inevitable result of organizations that aggregate such
massive quantities of data combined with technology that allows it all to
fit on a tiny USB stick.  Sooner or later, all of the data anyone might care
about will fit on such a stick, including every private e-mail you've ever
sent via cloud-based services and every embarrassing private photo you've
ever uploaded to a personal profile.

Subject: ORCA, Mitt Romney's high-tech get-out-the-vote program, crashed
  on Election Day (Michael Kranish)

Michael Kranish, *The Boston Globe*, 2 Nov 2012

Mitt Romney's online voter-turnout operation suffered a meltdown on Election
Day, resulting in a crucial 90-minute "buckling" of the system in Boston and
the inability of some campaign workers across the country to use a vital
smartphone program, according to campaign officials and volunteers.

Code-named ORCA, the program was kept secret until just before the election
in order to prevent hacking of the system. It was then trumpeted by Romney's
aides as an unrivaled high-tech means of communicating with more than 30,000
field workers who were stationed at polling places on Election Day. Those
volunteers were supposed to track who voted and to alert Boston headquarters
if turnout was lower than expected at key precincts.

But at Boston's TD Garden, where 800 Romney workers were staffing phones and
computers in coordination with the field workers to oversee the turnout, the
surge in traffic was so great that the system didn't work for 90 minutes,
causing panic as staffers frantically tried to restore service. Some
campaign workers also reported that they had incorrect PINS and had not been
informed that they needed certification to work at polling places. ...

Subject: Security issues threaten to derail tablet voting

  [My apologies to Rebecca Mercuri.  Seh sent me this item just *before* the
  election, and I requeued it to RISKS for the post-election issue -- but
  somehow it fell through the crack.  However, it is still very timely.  PGN]

http://tabtimes.com/feature/government/2012/11/05/security-issues-threaten-derail-rise-tablet-voting

This interview was done a while ago, but they apparently held the article
for publication immediately prior to the election. A few of my quotes
sounded even more pithy given the e-mail and fax voting options in NJ.

  [For example, see Andrew Appel's Freedom-to-Tinker item in RISKS-27.06.
  PGN]

Incidentally, *everyone* in NJ could have availed themselves of paper ballot
voting if they had registered as permanent absentees (no reason needed).
It's an easy form, and every year, like clockwork, your ballot shows up to
fill out and send back (or drop off at the County Board of Elections).  No
polls, no lines, no waiting.  And indeed, these are the only voter-verified
records available for hand-recounts in the Garden State.

Subject: WNYC's On the Media

3 reasons why Estonia's e-voting is irrelevant to the U.S.

1) Estonia has a national ID system that enables strong authentication of
   online citizen/gov't transactions. U.S. has no prospect of a national ID
   system, and no state has a state ID system that supports online
   transactions.

2) Estonia's elections are administered by the Federal government. U.S.
   elections are administered locally.

3) Even with much federal funding for a central I.T. system for i-voting,
   the result was a system with low software integrity and lax datacenter
   operations that were given a "gentleman's C-" by independent review by
   OSCE. In the less polite U.S., that grade would have been an "F".

Instead of saying "If it works in Estonia, why can't it work in the U.S?"
the question is "If it did not work in Estonia, why would you think it would
work for each of the thousands of U.S. local elections?"

Subject: Scientists Find Cheaper Way to Ensure Internet Security (John Markoff)

John Markoff, *The New York Times*, 20 Nov 2012,
Scientists at Toshiba and Cambridge University have perfected a technique
that offers a less expensive way to ensure the security of the high-speed
fiber optic cables that are the backbone of the modern Internet.
http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/20/technology/fiber-optic-breakthrough-to-improve-internet-security-cheaply.html

The research, which will be published Tuesday in the science journal
Physical Review X, describes a technique for making infinitesimally short
time measurements needed to capture pulses of quantum light hidden in
streams of billions of photons transmitted each second in data
networks.  Scientists used an advanced photodetector to extract weak photons
from the torrents of light pulses carried by fiber optic cables, making it
possible to safely distribute secret keys necessary to scramble data over
distances up to 56 miles.

Such data scrambling systems will most likely be used first for government
communications systems for national security.  But they will also be
valuable for protecting financial data and ultimately all information
transmitted over the Internet.

The approach is based on quantum physics, which offers the ability to
exchange information in a way that the act of eavesdropping on the
communication would be immediately apparent.  The achievement requires the
ability to reliably measure a remarkably small window of time to capture a
pulse of light, in this case lasting just 50 picoseconds -- the time it
takes light to travel 15 millimeters.  ...

  cryptography takes money that people don't have to solve a problem they

Subject: Bloomberg news: Why Cell Phones Went Dead After Hurricane Sandy
 by Susan Crawford

After Hurricane Sandy, survivors needed, in addition to safety and power,
the ability to communicate. Yet in parts of New York City, mobile
communications services were knocked out for days.

The problem? The companies that provide them had successfully resisted
Federal Communications Commission calls to make emergency preparations,
leaving New Yorkers to rely on the carriers' voluntary efforts.

Subject: Less privacy protection for IMAP users

In the US, e-mail privacy is protected by the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act. The law, passed in 1986, requires that law enforcement
officials obtain a warrant to intercept & read private e-mail.

But the law has a critical flaw: It treats e-mail left on third-party
servers for 180 days as “abandoned.” All that’s necessary for the
government to get copies of those older messages is for a prosecutor to
request them.

Now that IMAP and web-based mail is commonplace, many people use mail
servers for permanent storage of old messages. I doubt the average gmail
user considers his old messages as abandoned.

Apparently this loophole played a role in the recent investigation of CIA
director General Petraeus.

A coalition of e-mail service providers is seeking a revision of the law to
treat messages in the cloud the same as messages stored on a home computer.

The Obama administration opposes the change.

Subject: Privacy and surveillance

Good *NYT* article on the conflicting goals of investigating harassment or
security breaches, versus respecting people's privacy.

"The F.B.I. investigation that toppled the director of the C.I.A. [...]
underscores a danger that civil libertarians have long warned about: that in
policing the Web for crime, espionage and sabotage, government investigators
will unavoidably invade the private lives of Americans."  "What began as a
private, and far from momentous, conflict between two women [...] has had
incalculable public costs."

Unlocking the brilliance in high tech
Author describes her journey in the male dominated engineering trade
11/10/2012 5:09:00 PM By: Christine Wong

This article is mainly about how one woman got going in engineering, but
then gets into a risk of not having more women in the field.  "Examples in
her book include the fact that voice recognition software and car air bags
weren't originally designed with female users in mind, an oversight that had
disastrous results in the former case and life threateningly dangerous
consequences in the latter."

There are 2 halves to this idea. The good half is for the long form to
contain all the legalese, the official language that actually accomplishes
something, with the short form containing the PR version that conveys a
layperson's interpretation of the measure.

The bad half is letting the proponents compose the PR version. This is
likely to lead to things like "Little pig-tailed girls love kitties and
rainbows and butterflies, and isn't that wonderful?", regardless of what the
measure actually accomplishes. Its proposers will naturally skew the
interpretation to be as favorable as possible toward the outcome they
desire.

Here in Wisconsin the short-form wording is composed by the non-partisan
Legislative Reference Bureau, and this seems to have been satisfactory,
although we haven't had such issues with nearly the frequency of other
states.

On a related matter, I muse that sooner or later some jurisdiction will try
on-line voting, some 13-year-old computer whiz will hack the system to get
himself elected mayor or governor, and that'll be the end of that.
