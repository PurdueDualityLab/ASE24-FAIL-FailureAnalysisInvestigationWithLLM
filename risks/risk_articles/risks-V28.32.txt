Subject: Dallas hospital alters account of failure to diagnose first US
  Ebola case

The first three articles in RISKS-28.30 describe a Dallas hospital blaming
EHR software for not diagnosing the first US case of Ebola.  However on a
Friday evening, the hospital told another story. (Bad news released on
Friday evening is a popular PR tactic)

  But on Friday evening, the hospital effectively retracted that portion of
  its statement, saying that `there was no flaw' in its electronic health
  records system. The hospital said ``the patient's travel history was
  documented and available to the full care team in the electronic health
  record (E.H.R.), including within the physician's workflow.''

http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/us/containing-ebola-cdc-troops-west-africa.html

An ER patient history is not meaningless paperwork. It may be diagnostically
significant and an ER doc is responsible for examining it.  All patients are
asked about any foreign travel. While EHR software can be improved, human
and/or institutional error should be assigned the major blame for this
failure to diagnose Ebola.

Subject: Cars become uninsurable due to their weak security

According to a BBC report, insurance companies are refusing to insure
certain models of cars, or are requiring additional safeguards.  The reason?
The electronic keys can be hacked, and the number of thefts has been
increasing dramatically.

This is probably the most direct consumer connection between (computer)
security and insurance that I've seen.  Could you imagine "your homeowners
insurance bill is going up because you run Windows"?

  Regardless of the cause, the revocation of the affected certificate will
  require HP to re-issue a large number of software packages with a new
  digital signature. While the certificate drop may not affect systems with
  the software already installed, users will be alerted to a bad certificate
  if they attempt to re-install software from original media. The full
  impact of the certificate revocation won't be known until after Verisign
  revokes the certificate on October 21, Wahlin said.

Subject: ComputerCOP: dubious "Internet Safety Software" given to US families

Ars via NNSquad
http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/10/computercop-the-dubious-internet-safety-software-given-to-families-nationwide/

  Police chiefs, sheriffs, and district attorneys have handed out hundreds
  of thousands of copies of the disc to parents for free at schools,
  libraries, and community events, usually as a part of an "Internet Safety"
  outreach initiative. (You can see the long list of ComputerCOP outlets
  here.) The packaging typically features the agency's official seal and the
  chief's portrait, with a signed message warning of the "dark and dangerous
  off-ramps" of the Internet.  As official as it looks, ComputerCOP is
  actually just spyware, generally bought in bulk from a New York company
  that appears to do nothing but market this software to local government
  agencies using shady information.  The way ComputerCOP works is neither
  safe nor secure. It isn't particularly effective either, except for
  generating positive PR for the law enforcement agencies distributing
  it. As security software goes, we observed a product with a
  keystroke-capturing function, also called a "keylogger," that could place
  a family's personal information at extreme risk by transmitting those
  keystroke logs over the Internet to third-party servers without
  encryption. That means many versions of ComputerCOP leave children (and
  their parents, guests, friends, and anyone using the affected computer)
  exposed to the same predators, identity thieves, and bullies that police
  claim the software protects against.  Furthermore, by providing a free
  keylogging program--software that operates without even the most basic
  security safeguards--law enforcement agencies are passing around what
  amounts to a spying tool that could easily be abused by people who want to
  snoop on spouses, roommates, or co-workers.

Replay Attacks Spoof Chip Card Charges

An odd new pattern of credit card fraud emanating from Brazil and targeting
U.S. financial institutions could spell costly trouble for banks that are
just beginning to issue customers more secure chip-based credit and debit
cards.

Over the past week, at least three U.S. financial institutions reported
receiving tens of thousands of dollars in fraudulent credit and debit card
transactions coming from Brazil and hitting card accounts stolen in recent
retail heists, principally cards compromised as part of the breach at Home
Depot.

The most puzzling aspect of these unauthorized charges?  They were all
submitted through Visa and MasterCard's networks as chip-enabled
transactions, even though the banks that issued the cards in question
haven't even yet begun sending customers chip-enabled cards.

The most frustrating aspect of these unauthorized charges?  They're far
harder for the bank to dispute.  Banks usually end up eating the cost of
fraud from unauthorized transactions when scammers counterfeit and use
stolen credit cards.  Even so, a bank may be able to recover some of that
loss through dispute mechanisms set up by Visa and MasterCard, as long as
the bank can show that the fraud was the result of a breach at a specific
merchant (in this case Home Depot).

However, banks are responsible for all of the fraud costs that occur from
any fraudulent use of their customers' chip-enabled credit/debit cards
-- even fraudulent charges disguised as these pseudo-chip transactions. [...]

OS X bash Update 1.0 is now available and addresses the following:

Bash
Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.5, OS X Lion Server v10.7.5, OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5,
OS X Mavericks v10.9.5
Impact: In certain configurations, a remote attacker may be able to execute
arbitrary shell commands
Description: An issue existed in Bash's parsing of environment
variables. This issue was addressed through improved environment variable
parsing by better detecting the end of the function statement.
This update also incorporated the suggested CVE-2014-7169 change, which
resets the parser state.
In addition, this update added a new namespace for exported functions by
creating a function decorator to prevent unintended header passthrough to
Bash. The names of all environment variables that introduce function
definitions are required to have a prefix "__BASH_FUNC<" and suffix ">()" to
prevent unintended function passing via HTTP headers.

CVE-2014-6271 : Stephane Chazelas
CVE-2014-7169 : Tavis Ormandy

OS X bash Update 1.0 may be obtained from the following webpages:
http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1767 - OS X Lion
http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1768 - OS X Mountain Lion
http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1769 - OS X Mavericks

To check that bash has been updated:

* Open Terminal
* Execute this command:
bash --version
* The version after applying this update will be:
OS X Mavericks:  GNU bash, version 3.2.53(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin13)
OS X Mountain Lion:  GNU bash, version 3.2.53(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin12)

Sean Gallagher, Ars Technica, 3 Oct 2014
Mac.BackDoor.iWorm used Minecraft server subreddit for command and control.

The Russian antivirus vendor Dr. Web has reported the spread of a new botnet
that exclusively targets Apple computers running Mac OS X.  According to a
survey of traffic conducted by researchers at Dr. Web, over 17,000 Macs
worldwide are part of the Mac.BackDoor.iWorm botnet-and almost a quarter of
them are in the US. One of the most curious aspects of the botnet is that it
uses a search of Reddit posts to a Minecraft server list subreddit to
retrieve IP addresses for its command and control (CnC) network. That
subreddit now appears to have been expunged of CnC data, and the account
that posted the data appears to be shut down. ...

Subject: Shellshock fixes beget another round of patches as attacks mount
  (Sean Gallagher)

Sean Gallagher, Ars Technica, 30 Sep 2014
SANS' Internet Storm Center moves up threat level based on bash exploits in
  wild.

Over the past few days, Apple, Red Hat, and others have pushed out patches
to vulnerabilities in the GNU Bourne Again Shell (bash). The vulnerabilities
previously allowed attackers to execute commands remotely on systems that
use the command parser under some conditions-including Web servers that use
certain configurations of Apache. However, some of the patches made changes
that broke from the functionality of the GNU bash code, so now debate
continues about how to "un-fork" the patches and better secure bash.

At the same time, the urgency of applying those patches has mounted as more
attacks that exploit the weaknesses in bash's security (dubbed "Shellshock")
have appeared. In addition to the threat first spotted the day after the
vulnerability was made public, a number of new attacks have emerged. While
some appear to simply be vulnerability scans, there are also new exploit
attempts that carry malware or attempt to give the attacker direct remote
control of the targeted system. ...

Shellshock Exploits Targeting SMTP Servers at Webhosts
https://threatpost.com/shellshock-exploits-targeting-smtp-servers-at-webhosts/109034

The persistence of the Shellshock vulnerability remains high more than a
month after it first surfaced.  The latest attacks involved SMTP servers
belonging to web hosts, said a report published by the SANS Internet Storm
Center.

Attackers are using Shellshock exploits targeting the now infamous
vulnerability in Bash (Bourne Again Shell) in order to drop a perl script
onto compromised computers.  The script adds the hacked computers to a
botnet that receives its commands over IRC, said a post on the Binary
Defense Systems website: ``The attack leverages Shellshock as a main attack
vector through the subject, body, to, from fields.  Once compromised, a perl
botnet is activated and beaconing on IRC for further instructions.''

I want to add a few of my own thoughts to that article on the Windows 10

If any of those data collection features were enabled by default, and unless
there's a big red warning at installation that you must respond to with more
than a single click, explaining all these aspects, it's still
unacceptable. Too many people will download this and use it like any other
system without considering the implications. I couldn't care less what they
plan to do when it goes out of beta at this juncture -- I'm concerned about
right now.

As I recall they've done similar in previous previews, but the stakes are
much higher now given government attitudes to collected data.

It is a mistake to assume that everyone who will download this preview or
end up with it installed (perhaps by their "IT Guy") will be cognizant of
the options and implications. I'm the guy who found MS' undisclosed "phone
home" behavior years ago. It was not an enormous privacy problem, but it was
still telling and a lot of bad press for MS resulted.

Subject: The NSA has no interest in protecting you & me

The following paragraphs are an attempt to explain why the NSA hasn't any
interest in protecting you and me from cyber criminals.  It isn't
nonfeasance, but a result of the misapplication of Cold War thinking to the
Internet, and the NSA's preoccupation with China instead of with criminal
gangs on the Internet.

You and I are merely the "human shields" in this new Cold Cyberwar which the
US DoD has deluded itself exists with China.

The US Defense Department in 2014 is still caught up in obsolete concepts
from the Cold War when it inappropriately attempts to achieve "deterrence"
through "mutual vulnerability" in *cyber warfare*.

The concept of "Mutually Assured Destruction" (MAD) attempts to convince
both sides in a conflict that no matter who starts a war, both sides will be
utterly destroyed.  MAD was the primary doctrine of the US throughout most
of the Cold War, and although the Soviets never did attack, they also never
completely bought into the MAD notion.

A major component of MAD is "Mutual Vulnerability": since both sides are
equally vulnerable, each feels that it has more to lose from a war than the
other.  However, one curious consequence of Mutual Vulnerability is that
*Civil Defense is actually destabilizing*.  If one side invests
significantly in civil defense, it becomes less vulnerable, and may believe
that a war is survivable.  Such a civil defense strategy will break the
"Mutual" in MAD.

During the Cold War, therefore, the US invested almost nothing in civil
defense; the Soviets -- not so enamored with mutual vulnerability --
invested huge amounts.

As the links & quotes below demonstrate, the US DoD today has already
conceded that its cyber defenses are next-to-non-existent, and therefore has
ramped up its *offenses* -- e.g., the NSA's "TAO" group -- because it
believes that a MAD-style offensive deterrence is far cheaper than improving
defenses (i.e., echoes of the US Cold War strategy).

In the upside-down-world of MAD, mutual deterrence depends upon *mutual
vulnerability*, and hence *more vulnerable is better* !?!

The major problem with this MAD strategy is that while the deterrence may
eventually work against the Chinese *state*, this deterrence has absolutely
no effect against criminal enterprises terrorizing the Internet.  None of
these criminals feel the "Mutual" in MAD, much less the "Assured" or the
"Destruction".

So "MAD" is the reason why you and I remain vulnerable to ID crooks &
thieves; the more vulnerable, the better the deterrence works -- at least
against the Chinese.

If all of this sounds insane/MAD, you're right!  It is insane, which is why
RISKS readers have to blow the whistle on these bankrupt Cold War relic
doctrines.

Subject: Re: Should Airplanes Be Flying Themselves? (William Langewiesche)

It's an excellent article, well worth the 10 minutes to read it.

The Gimli Glider was in many ways the direct opposite of the Air France
crash.  In the Gimli case, there was a real and very severe problem, the
plane was in the middle of nowhere and ran out of fuel.  If the pilots
hadn't taken skillful action, the plane would have fallen out of the sky and
crashed.

With the Air France flight, there was no physical problem other than that
some sensors were iced over.  As Langewiesche makes clear, if the pilots had
done nothing at all, the plane would have been fine.  The sensor loss made
the plane drop back from the most automatic mode to a less automatic one,
but even so, the plane was flying without difficulty.

FYI -- I wonder if the music isn't "white noise" after all, but the sole
sound of DRM.  I can't wait for this clip to be posted to YouTube, so that a

Lorena O'Neil, The Hollywood Reporter
http://www.msn.com/en-us/music/news/taylor-swift-tops-canadian-itunes-chart-with-eight-seconds-of-white-noise/ar-BBaCB7A

A glitch in the Canadian version of iTunes released a track called "Track
3," that looked like it could be a new track from her upcoming album 1989
but was actually just white noise.  Nevertheless, the song soared to the
top, beating out her new songs that actually are real music, including
"Shake It Off," "Welcome to New York" and "Out of the Woods."

Haters might hate but once a singer scores a chart-topping hit comprised
solely of white noise, it's hard to deny she's an unstoppable musical force.
