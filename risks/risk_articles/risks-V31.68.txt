tissue perforation risk, historical injury or malfunction trends, any
monetary incentive they receive for promoting the recommended device,

Wade Rousch, Scientific American, May 2020, p.26

"In the speech-recognition business, 95 percent accuracy might as well be
zero." That's 1 of every 20 words erroneously transcribed automatically.

'ASR systems may never reach 100 percent accuracy. After all, humans do not
always speak fluently, even in their native languages. And speech is so full
of homophones that comprehension always depends on context. (I have seen
transcription services render `iOS' as `ayahuasca' -- and `your podcast' as
`your punk ass'.

A misplaced comma in a business document can dramatically affect legal
judgment.  Proofreading remains an important editorial function.  (see
https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180723-the-commas-that-cost-companies-millions .)

Risk: Over-reliance on ASRaaSWP -- automated speech recognition as a service
without proofreading.

In contrast to ASR,
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/technology/ai-transcription-human-services.html
testifies to the effectiveness of human-driven transcription. Subject matter
comprehension, contextual awareness, and conversational immersion elevate
transcription quality. These factors are substantially out-of-reach for ASR.

The technological race to improve ASR, and retire human transcription,
reminds me of "John Henry" per
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_(folklore). Perhaps an undiscovered
Agatha Christie story entitled "Death by Transcription" offers a
post-mortem?

Subject: Linux Security: Chinese State Hackers May Have Compromised 'Holy

Davey Winde, Forbes 7 Apr 2020 via ACM TechNews, 13 Apr 2020

A BlackBerry research and intelligence team said five Chinese advanced
persistent threat groups have long been attacking Linux servers that
"comprise the backbone of the majority of large data centers responsible for
the some of the most sensitive enterprise network operations." Particularly
worrying is evidence of the attackers using a previously undocumented Linux
malware toolkit including at least two kernel-level rootkits and three
backdoors, actively deployed since March 13, 2012. Analysis associated this
toolkit with one of the largest Linux botnets ever found, with a significant
number of organizations likely infected. Targets include Red Hat Enterprise,
CentOS, and Ubuntu Linux environments for purposes of cyber-espionage and
intellectual property theft, with researchers describing Linux defensive
capabilities as immature at best. Former U.K. Military Intelligence Colonel
Philip Ingram said mitigating such exploits entails "treating [the threats]
as if they are ... as much a threat as any other operating system."

Subject: The US Is Waging War on Digital Trade Barriers (WiReD)

As Washington tries to take China, Russia, and India to task, these nations
are mounting defenses in the name of `cybersovereignty'.

The US and other democratic states don't engage in many of the Chinese or
Russian activities that so worry policymakers in Washington, like
intellectual property theft. Clearly, these behaviors directly contradict
what many countries deem to be fair trade practices. But some issues, like
data localization mandates and data security regulations, are bound to
receive more domestic focus from the US and its democratic allies and
partners. How American policymakers reconcile these facts when addressing
perceived digital trade barriers elsewhere -- all the while combatting [*]
false equivalencies is crucial for digital diplomacy and trade going
forward.

California's Department of Motor Vehicles has authorized an autonomous
technology startup to test two driverless delivery vehicles in nine
cities. Startup Nuro will use its driverless low-speed R2 vehicle to begin
conducting deliveries with local retail partners. The startup has been
testing autonomous vehicles with safety drivers on the state's roads since
2017. Said Nuro's David Estrada, "Our R2 fleet is custom-designed to change
the very nature of driving, and the movement of goods, by allowing people to
remain safely at home while their groceries, medicines, and packages, are
brought to them." In February, Nuro was granted permission by the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration to deploy up to 5,000 low-speed
electric delivery vehicles without any human controls in Houston.

Subject: Legit email/websites considered harmful, or RISKs in the time of
  COVID-19

Earlier this month I received an email purporting to be an offer from UCSF
(a premier medical school/hospital in on the US West Coast) to access
information about COVID-19 through a third party (Emmi Solutions, LLC --
emmi in the sequel). Clicking on the appropriate "personalized code" button
landed on a sparse webpage that demanded my date of birth (DOB), so I
stopped.

Being about COVID-19, and associated with UCSF, this seems to be nice
example of the counterpart of a typical RISK: the legitimate email/website
causes more harm than if they were malicious!

To wit:

(1) The DOB requirement in the emmi landing page is a red flag, so many
  *recipients will refrain from going further and actually receiving the
  information* (like I did).

(2) The style and content of the email message *train recipients into
  vulnerability to malicious emails/websites,* by exposing them to red flags
  that turn out to be harmless.

Red flags include:

(i) Design language (if we can call it that!) / *branding inconsistent with
  the UCSF branding* - looks as if someone pasted a logo on something
  designed in 2005;

(ii) The *URLs contained in the email *lie*: the button says startemmi.com,
  but actually links to my-emmi.com. ("my-ucsf.com", anyone?)

(iii) I found no mention of this email campaign or emmi resources of in the
  UCSF COVID-19 page <https://coronavirus.ucsf.edu/>; *the emmi webpage
  looks unrelated to UCSF.

(iv) the aforementioned DOB requirement at the emmi landing page.

(3) The campaign *unnecessarily enables emmi to associate DOBs with IP and
  MAC addresses* (at least). Why is this necessary? This *undermines trust
  patients have in UCSF.

(4) By allowing emmi to collect DOBs, the campaign exposes emmi and through
  emmi UCSF, and importantly, recipients of the email, aka UCSF* patients,
  to* the risk of *unauthorized disclosures of personally identifiable data
  (PII).  Given the association of email address to the specific code, there
  is a strong likelihood the information matched via the website landing
  includes a lot more PII and is stored by emmi.

Subject: Efficacy of location surveillance

Having seen the reality of the app proposed for our [UK] NHS, and the great
distance between our public health folks' assumptions and those of assorted
tech companies and academics proposing private contact tracing, I blogged
about the issue:

https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2020/04/12/contact-tracing-in-the-real-world/

The time for contact tracing is past, for this wave. If we're going to use
it next wave then the 5,000 public-health officers on the UK local
government payroll won't be anything like enough. But we have a couple of
million people being paid by the government to do nothing. If we follow the
South Korean / Taiwanese example we'll want to start training lots of
them. It's important not to distract policymakers from that decision by
offering techno-magical promises on which we cannot deliver.

There have recently been several proposals for pseudonymous contact tracing,
including from Apple and Google. To both cryptographers and privacy
advocates, this might seem the obvious way to protect public health and
privacy at the same time. Meanwhile other cryptographers have been pointing
out some of the flaws.

There are also real systems being built by governments. Singapore has already deployedand open-sourced one that uses contact tracing based on bluetooth beacons. Most of the academic and tech industry proposals follow this strategy, as the *obvious* way to tell who's been within a few metres of you
and for how long. The UK's National Health Service is working on one too,
and I'm one of a group of people being consulted on the privacy
and security. [...]

'Weitzner said the Bluetooth concept works by identifying proximity, not
location. "We don't need to know where you were close to someone, just that
you were close to someone," he said."'

Common wisdom says that 'close' only counts for horseshoes and tossing hand
grenades.

Pandemic contact tracing, and proximity notification alerts, relies on human
civility and restraint. People are timorous, and on high-alert given
community spread potential. While social distancing protocols are generally
deployed and enforced, there's little risk of a riot.

A crowd of people protesting lock-down or other confinement restriction who
receive a proximity alert notification, given COVID-19 serological test
latency or a false-positive test result, might turn ugly very quickly.

Subject: New CDC Study Shows Coronavirus Can Survive For Hours On Floors,
  Walls, Shoes (Typer Durden)

Tyler Durden, ZeroHedge, 13 Apr 2020
<https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/new-cdc-study-shows-coronavirus-can-survive-hours-floors-walls-shoes>

A preview of a new study:
<https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0885_article> by the US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention - the CDC, for short - released last
night offers some distressing news for health-care workers, as well as their
families, partners and friends: New research suggests that nurses, doctors
and others can track the virus out of the ward and into another - perhaps a
more public, or less well-protected - environment, helping to spread the
disease in a new way that public health officials haven't really considered.

The study, entitled "Aerosol and Surface Distribution of Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in Hospital Wards, Wuhan, China, 2020",
was conducted in two wards at Wuhan's Huoshenshan Hospital by large team of
Chinese researchers back in February and March. Though the team insisted
that "respiratory droplets and close contact" remain the primary vectors for
the disease, the possibility for hospital workers to transmit the virus on
their shoes and clothes wasn't really well understood, until now.

And unfortunately, if the data are confirmed, it would suggest that wards
where coronavirus patients are treated are literally crawling with the
virus, placing these health-care workers at extremely high risk for
infection.

According to the research, "94% of swabs taken from the ICU floor and 100%
of swabs taken from one of the general wards used to treat patients with
severe symptoms tested positive for coronavirus."

Here's a summary of the research that describes how the GW and ICU were
found to have the highest levels of the virus present on the floors and
walls, as well as in the air. The rate of positivity was higher for the ICU
than the GW, which makes sense.

Even samples taken from the floor in the nearby hospital pharmacy showed
'weak positive' for the virus. Patients are not allowed in the pharmacy,
meaning there's only one way the samples could have gotten there.

From February 19 through March 2, 2020, we collected swab samples from
potentially contaminated objects in the ICU and GW as described
previously. The ICU housed 15 patients with severe disease and the GW housed
24 patients with milder disease. We also sampled indoor air and the air
outlets to detect aerosol exposure. Air samples were collected by using a
SASS 2300 Wetted Wall Cyclone Sampler at 300 L/min for of 30 min. We used
sterile premoistened swabs to sample the floors, computer mice, trash cans,
sickbed handrails, patient masks, personal protective equipment, and air
outlets. We tested air and surface samples for the open reading frame (ORF)
1ab and nucleoprotein (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative real-time PCR.

Almost all positive results were concentrated in the contaminated areas (ICU
54/57, 94.7%; GW 9/9, 100%); the rate of positivity was much higher for the
ICU (54/124, 43.5%) than for the GW (9/114, 7.9%) (Tables 1, 2). The rate of
positivity was relatively high for floor swab samples (ICU 7/10, 70%; GW
2/13, 15.4%), perhaps because of gravity and air flow causing most virus
droplets to float to the ground. In addition, as medical staff walk around
the ward, the virus can be tracked all over the floor, as indicated by the
100% rate of positivity from the floor in the pharmacy, where there were no
patients. Furthermore, half of the samples from the soles of the ICU medical
staff shoes tested positive. Therefore, the soles of medical staff shoes
might function as carriers. The 3 weak positive results from the floor of
dressing room 4 might also arise from these carriers. We highly recommend
that persons disinfect shoe soles before walking out of wards containing
COVID-19 patients.

The authors suggested that "air flow" and the forces of gravity might be
responsible for moving the samples to the floors and the walls.But this
certainly doesn't bode well for anybody arguing that the subway and
restaurants will be able to go quickly back to normal, since an asymptomatic
diner can leave the virus at their table for the next customer to pick up
even if the table sits empty for hours - or even overnight.

Liza Lin, Timothy W. Martin, Dasl Yoon, et al., *The Wall Street Journal*,
15 Apr 2020, via ACM TechNews, Friday, April 17, 2020

Governments worldwide are using digital surveillance technologies to track
the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, raising concerns about the erosion
of privacy. Many Asian governments are tracking people through their
cellphones to identify those suspected of being infected with COVID-19,
without prior consent. European countries are tracking citizens' movements
via telecommunications data that they claim conceals individuals'
identities; American officials are drawing cellphone location data from
mobile advertising firms to monitor crowds, but not individuals. The biggest
privacy debate concerns involuntary use of smartphones and other digital
data to identify everyone with whom the infected had recent contact, then
testing and quarantining at-risk individuals to halt the further spread of
the disease. Public health officials say surveillance will be necessary in
the months ahead, as quarantines are relaxed and the virus remains a threat
while a vaccine is developed.

rumors and facts regarding the response to coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Rumors can easily circulate within communities during a crisis.

Do your part to the stop the spread of disinformation by doing three easy
things:

   1. Don't believe the rumors.
   2. Don't pass them along.
   3. Go to trusted sources of information to get the facts about the
   federal (COVID-19) response.

Always go to trusted sources of information like coronavirus.gov or your
state and local government's official websites or social media accounts
for instructions and information specific to your community.

For more information on the coronavirus, please visit coronavirus.gov
<https://www.coronavirus.gov/>. You can also visit our coronavirus
(COVID-19) response <https://www.fema.gov/coronavirus> page for more updates
on the federal response. Follow state and local officials as well for
instructions and information specific to your community.  [...]

Subject: Risks of mass announcements in a Corona environment

So I just got a robot call from the NYC Department of Health in regards to
C-19.

Aside from the misleading info in it, and no way to ask it to "repeat", and
lots of fadeouts...

T-Mobile flagged it as a "scam likely".

Yes.  Really

Subject: Error rates and CoVID-19 antibody tests

In security, we know that there are errors that are false positives, and
errors that are false negatives, and that both can create problems.

At the moment, everybody is eagerly looking forward to serology tests for
CoVID-19.  These are tests (usually blood tests) that determine if you have
antigens or antibodies related to defence against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

At least, they *try* to determine that.  Because, well, errors.

A good article on this is available at NPR.
https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/15/834497497/antibody-tests-
for-coronavirus-can-miss-the-mark

If you want the tl:dr version:

If the test has 99% specificity, and you live in an area where only 1% of
the population is actually infected, then when you get a "positive" test,
and are reassured that you are immune, you actually only have a 50/50 chance
that you encountered the virus, and do have any defence.  (In BC, where I
live, the infection rate is about .03%, so the chance that a positive test
is of any use at all is far worse.)

Subject: Re: Masking the CoVID-19 problem (Slade, RISKS-31.65)

The purpose of contrarian writing is to promote discussion.  Slade has
certainly done so, and thus perhaps it has achieved its purpose.  In
particular, it is important to question significant controls proposed by
major bodies based upon scientific fact (with the caveat, that Julian
Bradfield < jcb@inf.ed.ac.uk mailto:jcb@inf.ed.ac.uk > observed, "in so far
as there any "facts" in such a fast-moving situation".)

I would also like to call into question the "six feet of separation" rule.
I get that we are talking large droplet transmission, and sneezing runs the
risk of transmission of droplets onto the clothes or other surfaces -- but
then, we are touching possibly contaminated surfaces anyways.  Are there
studies to support this, or is this just tied to a convenient number similar
to 'six feet under'?

It seems like these are good questions to ask and resolve for the *next*
pandemic.

Subject: Re: Can Legislatures Safely Vote by Internet? (Andrew Appel)

I'd imagine that the political class is terrified by the prospect of
immediate transparency. It seems that the legislative process has been
designed to hide their more despicable actions behind voice votes. Doing
things remotely would require them to actually cast a vote (aye or nay)
which would be recorded and immediately visible to their constituency.

It's my understanding that a favorite ploy in the US Congress, especially
for unpopular legislation, is to do it late on a Friday night right before a
recess, with only a few members (maybe 3) present in the chamber and the
gallery (both public and press) empty. If a majority then voice vote aye it
passes.

Then there is when a bill is passed, a clerk walks the original (marked up
with any floor passed amendments) to somewhere where it will be printed.
Apparently at this point its not unheard of for additional pages to be
inserted. Once it's been printed as a law, someone (press or public) notes
these new provisions and asks where they came from, with the typical
response being we don't know.

Over the years I've read news reports describing the above, but google isn't
cooperating in locating them.

I've been to Poughkeepsie.  Would that be the daughter of an IBM computer
design engineer, or an unusually young Vassar student?  [Most likely.  PGN]
