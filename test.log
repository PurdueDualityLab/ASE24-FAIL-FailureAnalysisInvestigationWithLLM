2023-11-07 02:47:23,331 INFO: The software failure incident occurred in 1994 when a Chinook helicopter crashed in Northern Ireland, resulting in the death of the crew and 25 counter-terrorist officers. The incident was originally blamed on the two pilots who were found guilty of gross negligence in the Mull of Kintyre tragedy. However, evidence has emerged challenging the official version of the crash and pointing to faulty computer software as the cause of the accident.

Documents written nine months prior to the crash by a senior engineering officer highlighted "deficiencies" in the software, indicating that the pilot's control of the engines could not be assured. Additionally, warnings and recommendations regarding the software were ignored, including a document written on the day of the crash stating it was "imperative" for the RAF to cease operations.

The impact of the software failure was severe, resulting in the loss of numerous lives and damage to the helicopter. The responsible entity for the failure was the faulty computer software onboard the Chinook helicopter. The impacted entity was the RAF, as they were operating the aircraft and conducted an official inquiry into the incident.

Despite the emerging evidence, the official RAF inquiry concluded that the aircraft was airworthy and maintained their findings of pilot negligence. However, the evidence challenging the official version raises doubts about the initial blame placed on the pilots. It suggests that the software failure played a significant role in the crash, highlighting the need to further investigate and address the shortcomings in the helicopter's software system. [116]

2023-11-07 02:58:01,766 INFO: The software failure incident occurred after January 1, 2010, when some Windows Mobile devices started attaching the wrong date to incoming SMS messages. The glitch caused the messages to appear as if they were sent in 2016. Microsoft acknowledged the reports of this glitch and stated that they were working closely with their manufacturing and mobile-operator partners to investigate the cause and rectify the issue.

The failure affected the SMS messaging system on Windows Mobile devices. The cause of the failure is described as a glitch, which implies a bug or fault in the software that caused the wrong date to be attached to the messages. However, the exact technical details of the glitch are not mentioned in the given context.

The impact of the failure was not specified in the context. It is mentioned that there were reports of the issue, but there were no widespread customer inquiries at the time. Therefore, the scale of the impact is uncertain.

The responsible entity for investigating and correcting the issue is Microsoft, as stated in the given context. They are working closely with their manufacturing and mobile-operator partners, indicating that multiple entities are involved in resolving the software failure.

The only entity mentioned to be affected by the failure is Microsoft, as they are the software maker and responsible for investigating and resolving the issue. The impact on end-users or customers is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. Therefore, it is unclear if any customers of Windows Mobile devices were affected by the glitch in the messaging system. [123]

2023-11-07 03:08:38,503 INFO: The software failure incident occurred when a fault was detected in the system manufactured by Gemalto, a French card manufacturer. The incident bears similarities to the millennium bug, where computers were predicted to be fooled into thinking it was 1900 during the transition from 1999 to 2000. However, unlike the millennium bug, the changeover happened without significant incident. 

Gemalto admitted responsibility for the failure, which is estimated to cost €300m (£270m) to rectify. The failure occurred during a software update attempt by Gemalto, potentially requiring the replacement of cards affected by the fault. Notably, Gemalto-manufactured cards in other countries were unaffected by the incident.

The impact of the failure is significant, with the estimated rectification cost being a substantial financial burden for Gemalto. Additionally, the fault may necessitate the replacement of the faulty cards, leading to additional expenses. It is likely that the incident has had negative implications for Gemalto's reputation, as evidenced by the drop in the company's shares by 2.6%. 

Gemalto, as the manufacturer of the faulty system, is the responsible entity for the software failure incident. The impacted entity is Gemalto itself, as it will bear the financial and reputational consequences of the incident. Other countries utilizing Gemalto-manufactured cards were unaffected, implying that the fault was limited to a specific system or batch of cards. [28]

2023-11-07 23:29:21,362 INFO: The software failure incident occurred when the 911 system was targeted by a Telephony Denial of Service (TDoS) attack. The attack was part of an extortion plot, where the perpetrators demanded money and, upon being denied, launched a high volume of calls against the 911 system, overwhelming it and preventing legitimate calls from getting through. The incident was recently brought to the attention of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) by researchers at Ben Gurion University in Israel.

The vulnerability in the 911 system, which allowed for the TDoS attack, had been previously identified by the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) four years ago and brought to the attention of DHS. However, the researchers noted that the vulnerability was worse than initially calculated by the researchers, indicating that the potential danger from such attacks is significant.

The impact of the software failure was that a large portion of legitimate callers were unable to reach 911 during the attack. According to the researchers, an attacker could cause approximately 33% of the nation's legitimate callers to give up on reaching 911 under these circumstances.

The responsible entity for the software failure incident is the unknown attackers who launched the TDoS attack. The impacted entity is the 911 system, which was overwhelmed and unable to handle the increased call volume. [47969]

2023-11-07 23:29:49,587 INFO: The software failure incident occurred after users installed the OS X 10.7.5 update for Lion. Following the update, users began experiencing extremely slow Time Machine backups, with speeds as low as a few kilobytes per hour. The backups were estimated to take days to weeks to complete. This issue was reported by users with various Mac models and backup setups, including local drives and Apple's Time Capsule devices.

The failure occurred specifically with the Time Machine and Spotlight functionalities of the operating system. The cause of the failure is attributed to the OS X 10.7.5 update, as reverting to the previous version (OS X 10.7.4) resolved the slow backup and indexing speeds. This suggests that the issue lies with the updated software.

The impact of the failure was seen in the significant delay and inefficiency in completing Time Machine backups. This could potentially lead to data loss or disruptions in the regular backup routine for affected users. Additionally, Spotlight also experienced delays in updating its index of the hard drive, further affecting the system's performance.

The responsible entity for the software failure incident is Apple, as they released the OS X 10.7.5 update that caused the issue. The impacted entities are the users who installed the update and encountered slow Time Machine backups and Spotlight indexing delays. [15285]

2023-11-07 23:30:21,319 INFO: The software failure incident occurred on Wednesday when TweetDeck, a popular Twitter management platform, was hacked. The hacker, a teenager named Florian, discovered that inserting the HTML code "&hearts" created a vulnerability in TweetDeck's software. This allowed attackers to insert computer code into tweets that would run actions and further propagate the problem when the tweet appeared in TweetDeck.

The vulnerability impacted users of the TweetDeck Chrome plugin, who began receiving random pop-up windows containing messages such as "Yo!" or "Please close now TweetDeck, it is not safe." This could potentially compromise user data.

Florian himself found the vulnerability and announced it, referring to it as a vulnerability and not a hack. He then informed Twitter about the issue. The responsible entity for the vulnerability is the flawed code in TweetDeck's software, which allowed attackers to exploit the system.

In response to the incident, TweetDeck initially took their services down to assess the security issue and then released a statement on Twitter acknowledging the bug. They indicated that they had pushed out a code fix earlier in the day, but it had failed to close the security hole. Therefore, the cause of the failure was the ineffective code fix.

Overall, the software failure incident occurred on Wednesday when TweetDeck's system was compromised due to a vulnerability in its software. The impact of the failure was experienced by users of the TweetDeck Chrome plugin, who received random pop-up windows containing potentially unsafe messages. The responsible entity for the vulnerability is the flawed code in TweetDeck's software, which allowed attackers to exploit the system. [27574]

2023-11-07 23:30:52,148 INFO: The software failure incident occurred when researchers discovered flaws in Internet-connected devices used in cars, which could be vulnerable to hacking attacks. The incident was presented at the Usenix computer conference in Washington, D.C. The system that failed was the software in the Internet-connected devices used in cars. The cause of the failure was the lack of sufficient security measures in the devices, which made them susceptible to hacking attacks. The impact of the failure was that hackers could gain unfettered access to a car's internal controls, putting the safety of the driver and passengers at risk. The responsible entity was the device maker, who initially did not respond to requests for comment but later issued a software update. The impacted entities were the users of the Internet-connected devices, including ride-sharing service Uber, as well as the general public who may encounter cars with these vulnerable devices. It is unclear when the failure initially occurred, but it was discovered and addressed by the researchers. [38919]

2023-11-07 23:31:20,532 INFO: The software failure incident occurred after Yahoo Mail underwent a major redesign of its email interface. Thousands of users reported major glitches and bugs in the new system, including issues with drafts not saving, emails not being sent properly, text not being formatted correctly, and errors logging into the site. This incident occurred within the last six days, as nearly 5,200 complaints about bugs were logged on the Yahoo forums during this time period.

Many users blamed Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer for the failings in the new Yahoo Mail redesign, as she was a top Google executive before joining Yahoo in July 2012. The new look of Yahoo Mail, which some called "beautiful," was attributed to Mayer, and it was believed to have backfired.

The impact of the failure was significant, as users expressed their frustration and anger towards the company. Complaints included claims that the new design eliminated many features and made Yahoo Mail look like a knock-off of competitor Gmail. Users also highlighted the loss of important functionality, such as the inability to sort emails by sender. The usability of the product was deemed to be compromised, and the incident sparked a surge of negative feedback.

The responsible entity for the software failure incident was Yahoo, specifically their development and design team who implemented the new email interface. The impacted entities were the thousands of Yahoo Mail users who experienced the glitches and bugs, and who expressed their dissatisfaction and disappointment with the new system. [22120]

2023-11-07 23:31:47,367 INFO: The software failure incident occurred on a sunny Saturday after the launch of Pokemon Go in 26 new countries in Europe. The game's servers crashed multiple times due to the overwhelming demand. The cause of the failure was the unexpected demand for the game, which caused the servers to become overwhelmed and shut down. The impact of the failure was frustrated fans documenting their woes on Twitter and experiencing difficulties accessing the game. The responsible entity for the failure is Niantic, the company behind Pokemon Go, whose servers proved vulnerable and crashed several times. The impacted entities were the users who were unable to log in and play the game, as well as those who were frustrated with the server issues and expressed their pain on social media. [45689]

2023-11-07 23:31:59,722 INFO: Based on the context given, it is likely that the software failure incident was caused by the overwhelming demand for the game, as well as potential DDoS attacks. In order to prevent such incidents, the following could have been done:

1. Server capacity planning: Niantic could have anticipated the high demand for the game and ensured that their servers were capable of handling the expected traffic. This could have prevented the servers from becoming overwhelmed and shutting down.

2. Security measures: Niantic could have implemented better security measures to protect their servers from DDoS attacks. This could include regularly monitoring and updating their systems, implementing firewalls and intrusion detection systems, and educating users about potential risks and how to avoid downloading malicious software.

3. Load testing: Prior to launching the game in new countries, Niantic could have conducted thorough load testing to identify any potential issues and ensure that the servers were capable of handling the increased demand. This could have helped prevent the servers from crashing again after the launch.

4. Rapid response and resolution: When the server issues occurred, Niantic could have responded quickly and efficiently to resolve the problem. This could have involved allocating more resources to their servers, optimizing the software performance, and addressing any vulnerabilities that were exploited during potential DDoS attacks.

5. Continuous monitoring and improvement: Niantic could have implemented a system for continuous monitoring of their servers and the game's performance. This would allow them to identify and address any issues or vulnerabilities before they escalate into major failures. Regular software updates and bug fixes could also help prevent future incidents.

It is important to note that without specific information about the incident itself and the measures taken by Niantic, it is not possible to determine the exact steps that could have prevented the software failure incident. [45689]

2023-11-07 23:32:20,185 INFO: The software failure incident occurred during a rocket launch, specifically when the pressure in engine five of the Falcon 9 rocket was trending high. Once the pressure reached the limit, the launch software took over and aborted the liftoff. The failure was not due to any sensor or software issues that had caused previous delays during simulations. The exact problem with the engine is unknown, but it is speculated to be a lack of sufficient fuel in the combustion chamber.

The impact of the failure was that the launch had to be aborted, causing a delay in the schedule. However, the SpaceX president, Gwynne Shotwell, emphasized that this was not considered a failure as it was a deliberate decision to abort for safety reasons. If the rocket had lifted off with a problematic engine, it would have been considered a failure. The next opportunity for a liftoff was scheduled for Tuesday at 3:44 a.m. EDT.

The responsible entity for the software failure was not mentioned in the given context. However, it was stated that the software guys could not be blamed for this incident, implying that they were not responsible. The impacted entity was SpaceX, the company manufacturing and launching the rocket. They had to investigate the problem and decide whether to fix the engine on the rocket or replace it with another one.

In summary, the software failure occurred during a rocket launch when the pressure in engine five was too high, leading to an abort. The cause of the failure was likely a lack of sufficient fuel in the combustion chamber. The impact was a delay in the launch schedule. SpaceX was the responsible entity, and they had to investigate the issue and decide on the necessary actions to address it. [11798]

2023-11-07 23:32:50,579 INFO: The software failure incident occurred in the GSM network operators' technology and operations. The failure was in the session-encryption key system, which allowed the researchers to decrypt and record live GSM calls between two phones in just a few minutes. The vulnerability was caused by the simplicity of network routing information being accessible through the internet and the reuse of encryption keys for multiple sessions. The impact of the failure was that the researchers were able to identify the location of target phones more precisely and gain access to encrypted system messages. The responsible entity for the failure was the GSM network operators, who did not adequately address the vulnerability in their system. The impacted entities were the users of GSM phones, whose privacy and security were compromised by the researchers' exploit. The failure occurred due to security flaws and shortcuts in the GSM network operators' technology and operations, making the GSM network insecure. The incident highlighted the need for improved security measures to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the privacy of GSM users. [54198]

2023-11-07 23:33:19,586 INFO: The software failure incident occurred when a security researcher, Chris Vickery, discovered a misconfiguration in the database of the Hello Kitty website. The database was left open to public access without any password or authentication. Vickery found thousands of similar vulnerabilities by searching an online database of connected devices. After Vickery notified Sanrio Digital, the company that owns the Hello Kitty brand, they fixed the issue in three servers. However, the database had been exposed for almost a month, allowing anyone with the internet address to access it.

The impacted entity was Sanrio Digital's website, specifically the SanrioTown.com community for Hello Kitty fans. Around 3.3 million user accounts were vulnerable, with personal information such as names, ages, and genders of fans at risk. However, Sanrio Digital stated that there was no indication that any personal information was stolen.

The cause of the failure was a simple misconfiguration of the database, which resulted in it being accessible without proper authentication. The impact of the failure could have been significant, as anyone with the database's internet address could have easily accessed and potentially stolen the data.

The responsible entities for the failure include the Hello Kitty website, under the ownership of Sanrio Digital, and the security researcher, Chris Vickery, who discovered the vulnerability and notified the company. [57308]

2023-11-07 23:33:51,548 INFO: The software failure incident occurred when the Dolphin HD browser version 7.0.1 failed to fix a security vulnerability related to URLs. The failure was discovered after a hot fix was released, but did not address the URL concern. As a result, MoboTap, the developer of Dolphin HD, quickly published version 7.0.2 to address the URL issues.

The specific system that failed was the Dolphin HD browser on Android devices. The failure was caused by a flaw in the client's check of the user's URL against a database containing 300 Webzine columns. This flaw allowed attackers to potentially take over a user's session if they knew the URL.

The impact of the failure was a potential compromise of user sessions, putting their data and privacy at risk. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) expressed concern over the security implications of the flaw and highlighted the need for browser vendors to consider such implications before implementing features.

MoboTap, the developer of Dolphin HD, was responsible for the failure. They downplayed the impact by stating that they never stored user data and had no intention to do so. However, their quick response in releasing version 7.0.2 indicates acknowledgement of the seriousness of the issue and their responsibility to fix it.

The incident impacted users of Dolphin HD on Android devices who had not updated to version 7.0.2. These users were at risk of having their sessions taken over if their URLs were known to attackers. The incident also called into question the privacy practices and disclosures of MoboTap, raising concerns among internet advocacy groups such as the EFF and People For Internet Responsibility. [8625]

2023-11-07 23:34:18,477 INFO: The software failure incident occurred on March 20, 2013, at 2 pm local time in South Korea. The system that failed was the Microsoft Windows machines used by three banks and two media companies. The cause of the failure was a logic bomb, a piece of code that triggered the wiping of hard drives and the master boot record. The logic bomb was programmed to activate at 14:00:01 on March 20, erasing data from multiple victims simultaneously. This coordinated destruction was enabled by a hex string (4DAD4678) found within the malicious file "AgentBase.exe." The malware was distributed through a spam message posing as a bank communication, containing a malicious attachment that downloaded nine files from different URLs.

The impact of the failure was significant, as it put ATMs out of operation and prevented South Koreans from withdrawing cash. Additionally, the hard drives and master boot record of the affected machines were completely wiped, resulting in the loss of data and rendering the systems inoperable. Users were greeted with a message on their screens stating, "Boot device not found. Please install an operating system on your hard disk."

The responsible entity for the attack remains unknown, as the source of the spam message and the origin of the malware were not identified in the provided context. However, the security firm FortiGuard Labs, through their threat researcher Richard Henderson, identified the logic bomb in the code and provided information about the attack. The impacted entities were the three banks and two media companies in South Korea whose machines were affected by the malware. [17638]

2023-11-07 23:34:47,941 INFO: The software failure incident occurred in the passenger air bags of Chevrolet Impala sedans. The failure was detected in the software algorithm that controls the passenger-side air bag. The failure was discovered after a formal complaint was filed in November by Donald Friedman, an engineer at a California crash analysis company, following an investigation into a Texas crash where the passenger-side air bag did not deploy despite the passenger weighing 170 pounds.

The impact of the failure was that the passenger air bags in 320,000 Chevrolet Impala sedans potentially could fail to deploy in a crash, putting the safety of passengers at risk. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an inquiry into the issue and investigated the problem in conjunction with the Land Rover recalls, which involved a memory problem in the system causing faulty computer signals.

The responsible entity for the software failure incident is Chevrolet, the manufacturer of the Impala sedans. The impacted entity is the passengers who are at risk of not having their air bags deploy in a crash. The failure was detected by an engineer at a crash analysis company who filed a complaint with the regulator.

Overall, the software failure in the passenger air bags of Chevrolet Impala sedans, caused by a faulty software algorithm, had the potential to impact the safety of passengers in 320,000 vehicles. The incident was brought to the attention of the regulator, prompting an inquiry into the issue. [28933]

2023-11-07 23:35:15,283 INFO: The software failure incident occurred over the last few weeks and affected print servers in companies globally. The failure caused the print servers to continuously print pages of meaningless characters, emptying paper trays. The cause of the failure was identified as a malware called Trojan.Milicenso, which primarily targeted Windows-based computers. The malware spread through malicious email attachments or visiting websites with malicious scripts.

While the malware was originally designed to direct computers to pages with advertisements, a side effect on some networks was the triggering of massive print jobs. It was determined that the garbled printouts were an unintended consequence of the malware infection rather than its intentional goal. The impact of the failure was significant, affecting organizations primarily in the United States and India, as well as in Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries in Europe and South America.

Symantec, an antivirus software company, reported the incident and provided insights into the malware's behavior and impact. They noted that the worst-hit regions were the US and India. Symantec had encountered Trojan.Milicenso in 2010 and identified it as a malware delivery vehicle for hire. The payload commonly associated with this version of the malware was Adware.Eorezo, specifically targeting French-speaking users.

In summary, the software failure incident involved the unintended consequence of an infection by the Trojan.Milicenso malware, which caused print servers to continuously print meaningless characters. The incident impacted various organizations globally, primarily in the US and India, and was reported by Symantec. [13033]

2023-11-07 23:35:49,232 INFO: The software failure incident involved vulnerabilities in the management software of medical pumps manufactured by Hospira. The incident occurred when researcher Billy Rios discovered four critical vulnerabilities in the software, which could potentially be exploited by hackers. The vulnerabilities allowed attackers to install malware on the pumps, distribute unauthorized drug libraries, and alter their configurations. One of the vulnerabilities involved a plaintext password hardcoded into the software, which could be used to exploit a SQL database.

The impact of the failure was significant as it potentially compromised the security and safety of the medical pumps. If exploited, hackers could distribute unauthorized drug libraries or alter pump configurations, potentially leading to incorrect dosages or other harmful consequences for patients relying on these pumps.

Hospira, the manufacturer of the pumps, was responsible for the software and faced criticism for the poor design and lack of security measures. Rios reported the vulnerabilities to the Department of Homeland Security's ICS-CERT, which notified Hospira and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA oversees the certification of libraries and updates for medical devices.

The incident impacted the healthcare facilities and patients who relied on the Hospira medical pumps. The vulnerability in the software posed a potential risk to the security and integrity of the drug libraries and pump configurations, which could affect patient safety. However, it is unknown whether any specific incidents or compromises occurred before the vulnerabilities were discovered and patched.

In summary, the software failure incident involved critical vulnerabilities in Hospira's medical pump management software, which could be exploited by hackers to distribute unauthorized drug libraries and alter pump configurations. Hospira was responsible for the software, and the incident impacted healthcare facilities and patients relying on the affected pumps. [35057]

2023-11-07 23:36:00,377 INFO: Based on the given context, it is clear that the software failure incident was caused by vulnerabilities in the management software of Hospira pumps. The incident could have been prevented by the following measures:

1. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments: Conducting regular audits and assessments of the software's security would help identify and patch any vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.

2. Strong password management: Avoiding the use of plaintext passwords and implementing strong password management practices would make it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system.

3. Proper validation ID generation: Generating unique validation IDs for each deployment of the Hospira pump would have made it harder for attackers to spoof the IDs and distribute unauthorized drug libraries.

4. Secure firmware updates and patches: Making sure that firmware updates and patches are securely delivered and installed on the pumps would help prevent unauthorized modifications and tampering.

5. Enhanced network security measures: Strengthening the network security measures, including secure firewalls and other defenses, would provide additional layers of protection against potential attacks.

It is important to note that the given context does not specifically mention any preventive measures implemented or recommended by Hospira or the Department of Homeland Security's ICS-CERT. Therefore, the exact preventative measures taken remain unknown. [35057]

2023-11-07 23:36:23,993 INFO: The software failure incident occurred after researchers discovered a security flaw in Philips Hue smart bulbs and other devices that use ZigBee transmissions. The researchers were able to carry out a hack using common equipment that cost only a few hundred dollars, without intercepting an actual firmware update from Philips. They disclosed their findings to Philips, who responded by issuing a security update to address the issue before it was made public.

The incident did not result in a virus or disclose information that could be used to create one. The researchers only demonstrated the possibility of an attack. The impact of the failure was that the security of the Philips Hue smart bulbs and potentially other ZigBee devices was compromised. This raised concerns about the difficulty of achieving effective security measures, even for a large company that utilizes standard cryptographic techniques.

The responsible entity for the software failure incident was the researchers who discovered the security flaw. They cooperated with Philips to help develop and roll out the software update. Philips Lighting, the manufacturer of Philips Hue smart bulbs, was responsible for addressing the vulnerability and issuing the necessary update to protect their products.

The impacted entity was the users of Philips Hue smart bulbs and other devices utilizing ZigBee transmissions. They were potentially exposed to the security flaw and faced the risk of unauthorized access or control over their devices due to this vulnerability. Philips recommended that all customers install the latest software update through the Philips Hue app to mitigate this risk, despite assessing the overall risk to the products as low. [49785]

2023-11-07 23:36:53,768 INFO: The software failure incident occurred from iOS 4 onwards on both the iPhone and iPad. The failure was related to a flaw in the settings of the iPhone, specifically the "Automatic Updates" setting. James Morris, who experienced the flaw, reported that the settings were misleading and not clearly understood by Apple, as well as their support staff. The failure caused downloads to exceed the 20MB limit per item over mobile networks, leading to excessive data usage without the user's knowledge.

The impact of the failure was significant for James Morris, as he received alerts from his network provider, Vodafone, for every 5MB downloaded, hindering his ability to turn off data quickly. This resulted in increased data usage and potential financial implications. The failure also affected other users who had not realized they were consuming more data than they intended, potentially leading to unexpected charges.

The responsible entity for the failure is Apple, as the flaw existed in their software. However, it is important to note that no official comment has been made by Apple regarding this incident.

The impacted entities are the users of Apple devices running iOS 4 or later, particularly those who were unaware of the flaw and unknowingly consumed more mobile data than they intended. James Morris is one such impacted entity who experienced the consequences of the flaw firsthand.

Overall, the software failure incident occurred in the settings of Apple devices running iOS 4 onwards, leading to excessive data usage and potential financial implications for the affected users, including James Morris. Apple is responsible for the flaw, as it existed in their software. [54517]

Additionally, if Apple's customer support (Apple Care) had better knowledge and understanding of the settings, they could have provided accurate guidance to the user and prevented the incident from occurring.

2023-11-07 23:37:26,747 INFO: The exact details of the software failure incident are not provided in the given context. However, the context highlights the need for a centralized database or clearinghouse to track and disclose voting machine problems nationwide. It mentions that voting systems have failed in certain counties and states, but specific incidents or causes of those failures are not specified. 

The failure occurred at various times in different counties and states across the United States, impacting the performance and reliability of voting machines. The lack of a centralized location for information about the encountered problems with specific brands of machines is mentioned as a consequence of this failure. The impact of these failures is that election officials are unable to easily access information or solutions related to the specific machines they use.

The responsible entities for investigating and resolving voting machine problems are mentioned as election officials and voting machine vendors. However, the context also suggests that there is a lack of oversight and enforcement power over voting machines and vendors at the state and national levels. Only a few states, like California, have passed laws requiring vendors to notify officials of any defects, faults, or failures within a given timeframe.

The impacted entities are the election officials across the 4,600 jurisdictions in the U.S. who rely on voting machines to conduct elections. They are not able to easily access information about problems encountered with the specific brand of machines they use, potentially leading to disenfranchisement of voters. The context does not provide specific examples of voters being directly impacted by software failures.

Overall, the context emphasizes the need for a centralized database or clearinghouse to track and disclose voting machine problems, allowing election officials to stay informed and take appropriate actions to address the failures. [2819]

As a result, the charging system would be stopped, leading to a drained battery. This would result in a loss of steering assist, windshield wiper operation, and the engine eventually stopping. 

The impact of the failure was significant as it could lead to a loss of directional control and increased risk of accidents. However, Mazda claimed that it was not aware of any accidents, injuries, or failures on customer vehicles related to this issue.

The responsible entity for the failure was Mazda, as they were the manufacturer of the vehicles. The impacted entities were the owners and drivers of the affected Mazda vehicles.

The failure was first known by Mazda last summer, but they did not recall the vehicles sooner. The agency questioned Mazda regarding this delay. Mazda initially argued that no recall was needed because the warning light was illuminated, making it not an unreasonable safety risk. However, after pressure from government safety officials in Japan, Mazda decided to issue a recall in both Japan and the United States. [26371]

2023-11-07 23:38:24,195 INFO: The software failure incident occurred last Wednesday when the Curiosity rover experienced a problem. It failed to send back science data and did not enter scheduled downtime sleep mode. Engineers investigating the issue discovered data corruption in the solid-state memory used by the rover's active flight computer. The corruption was found in the memory's directory, which tracks data storage locations. The engineers suspect that the memory glitch may have been caused by space radiation, specifically a "single-event upset" where an energetic particle managed to change the state of memory addresses, despite the components being radiation-hardened.

The impact of the software failure was that the rover was unable to send back science data and did not perform scheduled downtime operations. This resulted in a disruption to the rover's scientific activities and hindered its ability to function properly.

The responsible entity for the software failure incident is the Curiosity rover's active flight computer. The impacted entity is the Curiosity rover itself, as it was affected by the failure and experienced the interruption in its operations.

The engineers at JPL face a catch-22 situation. If the software is allowed to boot up and write data to the suspect memory locations, it could potentially destroy evidence that could help identify the root cause of the failure.

In order to resume limited science operations, the engineering team plans to bring the B-side computer fully online. However, they want to understand what went wrong with the A-side memory before utilizing the B-side computer to its full capacity. They aim to have a better understanding of the failure before proceeding with full operational activities. [17558]

2023-11-07 23:39:22,193 INFO: The software failure incident occurred when a security company, Lookout, discovered that over 50 Android applications were infected with malicious code. The failure was a result of these apps being injected with a root exploit, allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access and control over the affected devices. The incident was made possible by the open nature of the Android platform, which provided both strength and vulnerability. The failure was detected and the infected apps were promptly removed from the Android Market by Google.

The impact of this software failure was significant, as the infected apps had already been downloaded between 50,000 and 200,000 times within a span of just four days. This meant that a large number of Android users had potentially been affected by the attack and their devices compromised. The infected apps included popular and widely-used applications such as Falling Down, Super Guitar Solo, and Photo Editor, making the incident particularly concerning.

The responsible entity for injecting the malicious code into the apps was a group called "Myournet." They took advantage of the popularity of these free apps and exploited their user privileges to execute the root exploit. The impacted entities were the users who downloaded and installed the infected apps, as their devices became compromised and potentially exposed to further attacks.

Overall, this software failure incident highlighted the ongoing challenge of balancing openness and security in the Android ecosystem. While Google's swift response in removing the infected apps demonstrated their commitment to addressing such issues, the incident served as a reminder of the potential risks associated with software vulnerabilities and the need for robust security measures.

2023-11-07 23:49:54,914 INFO: The software failure incident occurred in March 2016 when Hewlett-Packard (HP) released a software update for their printers. This update caused the printers to reject ink cartridges produced or refilled by third parties. The failure specifically affected the printer system, causing it to malfunction and not recognize the third-party ink cartridges as valid. 

The cause of the failure was a "ticking timebomb" left by the manufacturer in the update. This suggests that the failure was intentional and designed to prevent users from using third-party ink cartridges. It also indicates that the failure was not immediately evident, as the printers had not received a software update recently, suggesting that the last update, six months prior, had a delayed-action effect.

The impact of the failure was twofold. Firstly, it prevented affected users from using third-party ink cartridges and forced them to only use cartridges produced or approved by HP. Additionally, it hindered affected users from getting the word out about a lockdown and discouraging others from updating their printers. This had broader implications for users in similar situations who may have been affected by the same or similar updates.

The responsible entity for the software failure incident was Hewlett-Packard, as they were the ones who released the software update containing the "ticking timebomb." The impacted entities were the users of HP printers who relied on third-party ink cartridges or were affected by the delayed-action effect of the update. [47715]

2023-11-07 23:50:27,385 INFO: The software failure incident occurred with Google Flu Trends (GFT), a system that aimed to forecast flu trends using big data. The failure was identified in a research paper published in Science, stating that GFT's prediction model was flawed and unreliable. The initial version of GFT in 2009 was problematic, as it tried to match 50 million search terms to 1,152 data points related to flu incidence. The researchers found that the chances of finding unrelated search terms that seemed to match flu incidence were quite high.

The specific cause of GFT's failure appears to be changes made by Google to its search algorithm and the introduction of its "autosuggest" feature in November 2009. These tweaks led to an inaccurate and flawed prediction model. The researchers compare GFT to a bathroom scale with a loosening spring that was never recalibrated, indicating that GFT was not regularly adjusted or fine-tuned.

The impact of GFT's failure is twofold. Firstly, it hindered scientific research in the field of flu trends and forecasting. Google's lack of transparency in explaining its algorithms and releasing its data blocked researchers from understanding and improving upon GFT's methodology. Secondly, GFT's inaccurate predictions could have affected public health efforts and resource allocation. If organizations or companies relied on GFT's predictions and made decisions based on faulty data, it could have led to misallocation of resources and ineffective response to flu outbreaks.

The responsible entity for the failure is Google, as they made changes to their search algorithm and introduced the autosuggest feature that affected the accuracy of GFT's prediction model. The impacted entities are the scientific research community, which was unable to access and study GFT's workings, and potentially public health organizations and administrations that relied on GFT's predictions for decision-making.

The system that failed was the signal strength indicator, which displayed two more signal bars than it should have in any signal condition. The cause of the failure was a software glitch in the formula used to calculate the number of signal bars to display. The impact of the failure was reception problems experienced by users, leading to a dramatic drop in bars. Apple was the responsible entity for the incident, as they developed and released the software upgrade to address the glitch. The impacted entity was the customers who owned the original iPhone and experienced reception issues due to the incorrect signal strength indication. [2321, 2375]

2023-11-07 23:51:28,059 INFO: The software failure incident occurred on November 11, 2011, at Lucky Supermarkets, a chain owned by Save Mart, in northern California and northern Nevada. During routine maintenance on a self-checkout machine, an employee discovered an extra computer board that was placed inside the checkout machine, which was recording customers' financial information. This incident was caused by a fraud scheme where criminals tampered with the credit and debit card readers at self-checkout lanes in over 20 supermarkets operated by the California chain. 

The impact of the software failure was significant, with over 1,000 customers reporting compromised account data. Lucky Supermarkets received numerous calls from customers who had fallen victims to the compromised machines. As a result, Lucky Supermarkets issued a consumer advisory, urging affected customers to close their bank and credit card accounts. The incident also prompted the company to inspect the rest of its 234 stores to ensure the safety of their customers' financial information.

Lucky Supermarkets, the affected entity, took responsibility for investigating the issue and working with law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal levels to identify those responsible for the fraud. The incident raised concerns about the security of self-checkout machines and the vulnerability of customers' financial information. The failure highlighted the need for better cybersecurity measures and raised awareness among customers about the importance of regularly monitoring their financial accounts for any suspicious activity.

2023-11-07 23:51:57,937 INFO: In this software failure incident, Tesla experienced a vulnerability in their software that was discovered by Keen Security Lab. The vulnerability could only be exploited when the car's web browser was being used and the car was connected to a malicious WiFi hotspot set up by the hackers. Tesla was informed about the bug and within 10 days, they deployed an over-the-air software update to fix the problem. The company stated that the risk to their customers was very low but they still responded quickly to address the issue.

The failure occurred when the car's web browser was in use and the car was connected to a malicious WiFi hotspot. The specific system that failed was not explicitly mentioned in the context, but it can be inferred that it was related to the car's software and its vulnerability to external attacks.

The cause of the failure was the presence of a bug in Tesla's software, which allowed the hackers to exploit the car's web browser and gain access to the system when connected to their malicious hotspot.

The impact of the failure was potentially compromising the security and privacy of Tesla's customers. However, Tesla stated that the risk to their customers was very low. They responded quickly by releasing a software update to fix the bug, minimizing the impact of the failure.

The responsible entities in this incident were Tesla and Keen Security Lab. Keen Security Lab discovered the vulnerability and responsibly disclosed it to Tesla. Tesla promptly developed and deployed a software update to address the issue.

The impacted entity in this incident was Tesla and its customers, as their cars were potentially vulnerable to the exploit when connected to a malicious WiFi hotspot. However, Tesla acted swiftly to mitigate the risk and protect their customers. [47732, 47966]

2023-11-07 23:52:27,851 INFO: The software failure incident occurred during pre-production trials of a Toyota vehicle. The system that failed was the cruise-control system. The cause of the failure was identified as an electronic software problem. This issue caused "sudden unintended acceleration" in the test vehicle. The impact of the failure is not explicitly mentioned in the given context, but it can be inferred that this failure could potentially lead to accidents and even fatalities, as similar incidents were reported in Toyota vehicles in 2010. The responsible entities for the failure are the Toyota engineers who discovered the problem in their vehicle's software. The impacted entity would be Toyota, as their reputation and sales could be affected by reports of sudden unintended acceleration in their vehicles. [10012]

2023-11-08 00:02:58,561 INFO: The software failure incident occurred in an unidentified utility company's SCADA system, a system that controls and monitors industrial processes. The failure was discovered after two to three months of operators noticing "glitches" in remote access for the SCADA system. The nature of these glitches was not specified in the report. The hackers initially compromised the SCADA software vendor located in the US, which gave them access to the utility company's network. During the intrusion, the hackers used log-in credentials, and the utility company operators dismissed the instability as normal system behavior until the SCADA system started turning on and off. This prompted the realization that something was wrong. The impact of the failure was not explicitly mentioned, but it is implied that it caused physical destruction, which is unusual for cyber incidents. The responsible entity(s) for the failure are the hackers who perpetrated the intrusion. The impacted entity is the utility company whose SCADA system was compromised. It is highlighted that there could be other utilities with compromised networks that are currently unaware of the breach, making the situation concerning. The incident received attention in reports distributed by the Department of Homeland Security's Industrial Control System-Cyber Emergency Response Team and various security lists. Unfortunately, the report does not disclose the specific utility company or software vendor affected. [8964, 8870]

2023-11-08 00:03:30,992 INFO: The software failure incident occurred in November when an MQ-9 Reaper crashed near Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan. The primary cause of the crash was the failure of the generator, combined with the depletion of the backup batteries. As a result of this failure, the aircraft crashed, but fortunately, there were no injuries or damages to civilian property.

The responsible entity for the incident was the Air Force, as stated in the accident report released last year. The impact of the failure was the loss of the MQ-9 Reaper drone, which is an armed drone used for various military operations. The incident report specifically mentioned that the decision to not lower the landing gear earlier contributed to the decision to crash the aircraft, indicating a potential human error in addition to the software failure.

There is no information provided regarding the specific system that failed or any details about the software involved in the incident. However, it can be inferred that the software failure was related to the control or operation of the MQ-9 Reaper drone, as it led to the crash.

Overall, the software failure incident occurred during a military operation in Afghanistan, resulting in the loss of an MQ-9 Reaper drone. The failure was attributed to the generator and backup battery depletion, with potentially the delay in uploading software and human error playing a role as well. The responsible entity was the Air Force, and there were no injuries or damages to civilian property. [162, 39478]

2023-11-08 00:04:04,736 INFO: The software failure incident occurred when researchers Xeno Kovah and Corey Kallenberg discovered vulnerabilities in the BIOS of various computer systems. The incident took place during a presentation at the CanSecWest conference in Vancouver. The BIOS, which is responsible for managing system operations, was found to have incursion vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to gain escalated privileges on the system. These vulnerabilities were discovered in PCs from Dell, Lenovo, and HP, indicating a widespread issue in the industry.

The failure was caused by the lack of security measures in the BIOS code, which made it easy for the researchers to uncover vulnerabilities. Physical access to a system enabled the researchers to infect the BIOS in just two minutes, highlighting the potential for unauthorized access and compromise. Additionally, the researchers developed malware called LightEater to exploit the vulnerabilities and hijack the system management mode.

The impact of the failure was significant as it undermined the security of specialized operating systems like Tails, commonly used by journalists and activists for secure communication. The BIOS failure exposed these systems to potential compromise. The responsible entity for the failure was the developers and manufacturers of the affected BIOS, as they did not adequately address the known vulnerabilities. The impacted entities were the users of the affected PCs and the individuals relying on secure communication through systems like Tails.

Overall, this incident brought attention to the need for improved security in BIOS code to prevent unauthorized access and compromise of computer systems. The researchers' findings emphasized the importance of patching and securing BIOS to mitigate the risks associated with these vulnerabilities. [34475]

2023-11-08 00:04:37,283 INFO: The software failure incident occurred on March 29, 2016, when a bug in Apple's iOS 9.3 operating software caused multiple issues for iPhone and iPad users. The specific system that failed was the core system for linking web addresses and apps within iOS, known as Universal Links.

The cause of the failure was an error in the travel planning app Booking.com, which overloaded the Universal Links system. This resulted in links and web addresses not functioning properly and caused iPhones and iPads to crash. Additionally, users of iPhone 5S or earlier models and iPad Air and earlier models experienced a lockout after updating to iOS 9.3, as they were required to enter their Apple ID password and faced unusable devices if they couldn't remember it.

The impact of the failure was significant, affecting thousands of Apple smartphone and tablet users. Many users were unable to access links and web addresses, rendering certain features and functionalities useless. The crashes and device lockouts caused frustration and inconvenience for those impacted.

Apple acknowledged the problem and recognized that a permanent fix would require an update to iOS. They also mentioned the need to address other apps that might be causing similar issues. However, it is unclear from the provided context who the responsible entity(s) for the software failure incident are, as the text does not explicitly mention the responsibility of Booking.com or Apple. The impacted entities were the iPhone and iPad users who experienced the bugs and crashes. [41561, 41986]
