The impact of the security snafu was downplayed by Alan Cooper, a spokesman for MoboTap, stating that they have never stored anyone's user data and have no intention to do so. However, it is mentioned that the Dolphin HD update notice in the Android Market did not specify what was actually changed in version 7.0.2, raising concerns about the authors' ignorance regarding basic privacy practices and disclosures. A hot fix was released, but it was mentioned that it did not fix the URL concern, so version 7.0.2 was then published to fix all URL issues. There seems to be some discrepancy regarding whether version 7.0.1 still forwards URLs, which Cooper said he would bring to the attention of the developers to double-check.
