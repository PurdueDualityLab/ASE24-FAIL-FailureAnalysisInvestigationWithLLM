WASHINGTON — The Justice Department said on Wednesday that a group of hackers associated with China’s main intelligence service had infiltrated more than 100 companies and organizations around the world to steal intelligence, hijack their networks and extort their victims. The United States government presented the allegations in a set of three indictments unsealed on Wednesday that showed the scope and sophistication of China’s attempts to unlawfully advance its economy and to become the dominant global superpower through cyberattacks. The indictments also said some of the  hackers  had worked with Malaysian nationals to steal and launder money through the video game industry. “The Chinese government has made a deliberate choice to allow its citizens to commit computer intrusions and attacks around the world because these actors will also help the P.R.C.,” Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen said, referring to the People’s Republic of China in a news conference where he announced the charges. The acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Michael R. Sherwin, said some of the perpetrators viewed their association with China as providing “free license to hack and steal across the globe.” The hackers, Zhang Haoran, Tan Dailin, Jiang Lizhi, Qian Chuan and Fu Qiang, targeted social media and other technology companies, universities, government agencies and nonprofits, according to the indictments. They had such reach partly because they used a so-called supply chain attack that enabled them to break into software companies and embed malicious code in their products. Once those products were installed in other systems, the hackers could use the code that they had planted to break in. The attack described by Justice Department officials on Wednesday was among the first supply chain attacks publicly revealed in a U.S. indictment of Chinese nationals. Some of the Chinese hackers also worked with two Malaysian businessmen to use video game platforms to steal from the companies and launder illegal proceeds. The businessmen, Wong Ong Hua and Ling Yang Ching, were arrested on Monday in Malaysia, officials said. The criminal computer activity and the hackers had been tracked by cyberresearchers under the group names Advanced Persistent Threat 41, Barium, Winnti, Wicked Panda and Panda Spider, officials said. “They compromised video game distributors to proliferate malware, which could then be used for follow-up operations,” said John Hultquist, the senior director of threat intelligence at the cybersecurity company Mandiant. The group known initially as Wicked Spider to researchers at CrowdStrike, the California cybersecurity firm, seemed to be hacking for profit. But starting in late 2015, there was a notable shift. The group, which had been predominantly targeting gaming companies, shifted to a long list of companies in the United States, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and  Taiwan  that operated in agriculture, hospitality, chemicals, manufacturing and technology whose intellectual property would assist China’s official Five-Year Plan, the nation’s top-level policy blueprint. Their techniques changed as well. In the past, the group was known to use similar malware across attacks, but that year its hackers started pursuing a more sophisticated set of supply chain attacks.  By late 2016, researchers concluded that the hackers they had known as Wicked Spider were operating at the behest of the Chinese state and changed their moniker to Wicked Panda. Panda was CrowdStrike’s moniker for hacking groups that acted on orders from the Chinese government. As the indictments were announced on Wednesday, researchers applauded the effort. “The United States government is starting to turn the tide on Chinese intrusion operations on Western companies and targets,” said Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike’s head of threat intelligence. Verizon, Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, helped the government in its investigation.']} in VectorDB

This story is  adapted from  Crime Dot Com: From Viruses to Vote Rigging, How Hacking Went Global ,  by Geoff White. It’s 30 degrees in the shade and I’m standing, sweating, at the entrance to a sprawling street market in the Quiapo district of Manila, capital of the Philippines. On a piece of paper I’ve written the name of the person I’m searching for: a Filipino man named Onel de Guzman. I’ve heard he might have worked among the mass of stalls spread out before me ... maybe ... several years ago. I start showing the piece of paper to people at random. It seems an impossible task. The wildest of goose chases. I don’t know what de Guzman looks like now, because the only photo I have of him is almost 20 years old. Even worse: In the grainy shot, taken at a chaotic press conference, de Guzman is wearing sunglasses and covering his face with a handkerchief. The young student had good reason to hide. He’d been accused of unleashing  the Love Bug , a high-profile and extremely successful virus that had infected an estimated 45 million computers worldwide and caused billions of dollars’ worth of damage.

The virus was groundbreaking. Not because of its technical complexity or the disruption it caused, but because it showed how to utilize something far more powerful than code. It perfectly exploited a weakness not in computers, but in the humans who use them—a tactic that has been used in countless cybercrimes since. But de Guzman had never admitted to anything. He’d mumbled his way through the press conference, given a couple of noncommittal interviews to the media, and escaped without prosecution. Then he’d gone to ground and hadn’t surfaced in two decades. No social media, no online profile. A ghost in the digital world he’d once been accused of terrorizing. It had taken me a year to get any kind of lead as to his whereabouts. There were rumors he was in Germany, that he worked for the United Nations in Austria, that he’d moved to the United States, or even that he’d been hired by Microsoft. And now I was stumbling through a market in Manila, showing his name in the hope someone would recognize it. If I could find him, maybe I could ask him about the virus and whether he understood its impact. And perhaps I could get him to tell me, after 20 years, whether he was really the one behind it. But as I brandished his name, all I got were blank looks and suspicious questions. Then one of the market stallholders grinned at me. “The virus guy? Yeah, I know him.” The Love Bug  virus was unleashed on May 4, 2000. It was simple, but devastatingly effective and highly contagious. Once infected, many of the user’s files would be overwritten with copies of the virus, so that whenever the victim tried to open the files, they’d reinfect their system. The virus also tried to steal people’s passwords. But the true genius lay in how it spread. Once infected, the victim’s computer would send an email to everyone in their Microsoft Outlook contacts book. The emails read: “kindly check the attached love letter coming from me,” and attached was a copy of the virus, disguised as a text file with the title “love-letter-for-you.” Faced with such a tempting message, many people took the bait, opened the attachment, and got infected. It didn’t take long for the virus to spread around the world. When you think about the math, its success becomes easy to understand, and quite frightening: If the initial victim had sent it to 50 people, and then each of them infected another 50 people, and so on, it would only take six jumps for the virus to infect everyone in the world (presuming they all had computers). Panic ensued: Systems in banks and factories were infected. In the UK, Parliament shut down its email network for several hours to prevent infection. Even the Pentagon was reportedly affected. Just a few months previously, the world had been fretting about the risk of a so-called Y2K bug—the fear that computers would fail to cope with the switch from dates in the 1900s to the 2000s. The damage predictions had been massively exaggerated, and the vast majority of systems were unaffected. But just as the tech industry breathed a sigh of relief, the Love Bug virus showed the true scale of devastation that could be caused in an increasingly connected world. Estimates of the damage ran into the tens of billions of dollars—much of it spent on fixing infected computers and preventing reinfection. Once it was released, the virus code could be downloaded and tweaked by anyone: within days, researchers were seeing dozens of copycat versions being unleashed. As the news coverage became ever more shrill,  investigators got to work  trying to trace the source of the bug. The passwords stolen by the virus were being sent to an email address registered in the Philippines. Local police traced the email account to an apartment in Manila. The net was closing in. After some initial questioning, they identified one Onel de Guzman, a 23-year-old computer science student at AMA Computer College, studying at the Makati campus, a grim, gray concrete building in the center of the city. The virus had mentioned the phrase  grammersoft , which investigators quickly established was an underground hacking cell made up of AMA students, some of whom had started experimenting with viruses. De Guzman was a leading member. As journalists poured into town, de Guzman’s lawyer hastily arranged a press conference so the world’s media could put their questions to the man increasingly assumed to be at the heart of global virus outbreak. De Guzman appeared, seemingly terrified, hiding behind dark glasses and holding a handkerchief over his face, covering his prominent acne scars. He hung onto his sister, Irene, who lived in the flat that the police had originally raided. Flashguns popped and news cameras zoomed in as de Guzman took his seat. But anyone expecting clarification was soon disappointed. De Guzman’s lawyer fielded many of the questions with vague non-answers. De Guzman himself seemingly didn’t speak much English. Finally, one of the assembled media managed to ask a key question: Did de Guzman, perhaps, release the virus accidentally? “It is possible,” mumbled de Guzman. And that was it. There were no more questions. The press conference ended, and de Guzman’s solitary non-answer was the closest anyone got to an explanation of a virus that infected 45 million machines worldwide. De Guzman  was never prosecuted  because, at that time, the Philippines had no law against computer hacking. Soon, the cameras packed up, the news crews left, and the story slipped off the agenda. With the true author unconfirmed, suspicion fell on de Guzman’s schoolfriend Michael Buen, whose name had appeared on a previous virus, called Mykl-B. Buen denied having anything to do with the Love Bug outbreak, but his pleas were largely ignored. Most online sources still list de Guzman and Buen as the creators of the virus, either jointly or separately, and that’s how it’s been for 20 years. Until now. The Minor Basilica  of the Black Nazarene is one of Manila’s most revered Catholic shrines, and in its shadow lies the labyrinthine expanse of Quiapo market, home to everything from Hello Kitty backpacks to LED-lit Virgin Mary statuettes. It was here, acting on a tip-off, that I came to look for Onel de Guzman. Eventually, the friendly stall-holder who remembered him directed me across town to a different shopping district. I went down another rabbit hole of market stalls, flashing the piece of paper with de Guzman’s name written on it, looking like a tourist dad who’d lost his kids. After many blank looks and suspicious questions, a bored-looking trader pointed me in the direction of a nearby commercial unit. It was empty, but after 10 hours of waiting for him to turn up to work, I finally came face to face with Onel de Guzman. Now 43, his juvenile acne scars have all but disappeared, and his diamond-shaped face has filled out into comfortable middle age. Still as shy as he was at the press conference all those years ago, he hides his gaze under a mop of jet-black hair, his face occasionally breaking into a smile displaying a distinctive set of uniform teeth. He’d changed so much, I began to doubt I was actually speaking to the real de Guzman, so I started making a furtive sketch in my notepad of the position of the moles on his face, to compare later on with the photo of him from 20 years ago. Back then, in the chaotic press conference, he’d swerved the question of whether he had written the virus, giving the half-answer that’s remained hanging in the air ever since. According to de Guzman, it wasn’t his idea to be so evasive. “That’s what my lawyer told me to do,” he says, in halting English. I’d expected to have to extract the truth from de Guzman by forensic interview, and I’d lined up my evidence like an amateur barrister. Remarkably, he wasted no time in confessing to a wrongdoing he’d ducked ever since the turn of the millennium. “It wasn’t a virus, it was a Trojan,” he says, correcting my terminology to point out that his malicious software worked by sneaking onto a victim’s computer disguised as something benign. “I didn’t expect it would get to the US and Europe. I was surprised.” The story he went on to tell is strikingly straightforward. De Guzman was poor, and internet access was expensive. He felt that getting online was almost akin to a human right (a view that was ahead of its time). Getting access required a password, so his solution was to steal the passwords from those who’d paid for them. Not that de Guzman regarded this as stealing: He argued that the password holder would get no less access as a result of having their password unknowingly “shared.” (Of course, his logic conveniently ignored the fact that the internet access provider would have to serve two people for the price of one.)

In hindsight, perhaps his guilt should have been obvious, because this was almost exactly the scheme he’d mapped out in a thesis proposal that had been rejected by his college the previous year. At the time, he says, designing such software wasn’t difficult. “There was a bug in Windows 95,” he says. “If someone clicks the attachment, [the program] will run through their machine.” But there’s the rub: how to get people to click on the attachment? De Guzman says he would hang out in internet chat rooms where Manila internet users gathered, and strike up conversations. He would then send his victims an infected file, pretending it was his picture. It worked. “I chatted only to people that had no knowledge of computers, to experiment on them,” he says. De Guzman had good reason to confine his hacking to Manila residents. At this time, internet access relied on dialup. Since Manila’s dialup passwords would only work on Filipino phones, and de Guzman was stealing passwords to use on his home phone line, he had no need to target victims outside the city. If he’d kept it that way, his life might have been very different. But, like many hackers, de Guzman was curious, and wanted to push his virus forward. In May 2000, he tweaked his original code so that it would not simply be restricted to Manila residents. He also made two other changes that would ensure his place in hacker history. First, he programmed the virus so that once it had infected a computer, it would send a copy of itself to each person in the victim’s email address book. By doing so, he created a so-called worm virus, a self-spreading monster with no off switch. Once released, de Guzman would have no control. His second change was the work of true, if perhaps unconscious, genius. Once the virus spread beyond de Guzman’s hands, he needed a way of tempting recipients into opening the attachment that contained the code. His old trick of pretending it was a photo wouldn’t work, so he came up with a new tactic: He gave the virus a title that had universal and near-irresistible appeal. “I figured out that many people want a boyfriend, they want each other, they want love, so I called it that,” he says. The Love Bug was born. Like many hackers,  de Guzman is a night owl. He finds the dark hours quieter, making it easier to concentrate. It was 1 am when de Guzman found his patient zero, the person whose initial infection would go on to spread the virus. He was chatting online to a fellow Filipino who was living in Singapore. De Guzman can’t remember who the man was, but he remembers sending him a copy of his new, improved virus. Unaware of the worldwide chaos he’d just unleashed, de Guzman says he then went out and got drunk with a friend. Within a day, though, his virus had spread like wildfire and investigators were closing in on their suspect. His mother contacted him. She’d received word the police were hunting a hacker in Manila, and she knew of her son’s illicit hobby. She hid his computer but crucially left the disks, one of which had the Mykl-B virus on it, pulling Michael Buen and several dozen other AMA students onto the police’s radar. For 20 years, de Guzman’s silence left a cloud hanging over his classmate Buen, who is commonly listed as the joint author of the virus. Yet according to de Guzman, he had nothing to do with it. The pair had written viruses before, he says, but the Love Bug was written by de Guzman alone. De Guzman says he had to take a year off after the incident to let the heat die down, during which he didn’t touch a computer. He never went back to AMA and never graduated. He later became a mobile-phone technician. He says he regrets writing the virus, but he now faces the fate of all wrongdoers in the internet age: infamy that will never decay. “Sometimes I get my picture on the internet,” he says. “My friends said, ‘It’s you, it’s you!’ They find my name. I’m a shy person, I don’t want this.” His children are ages 7 and 14. He knows one day soon they will find out about his role in one of the world’s most infamous viruses. He’s not sure how he’ll deal with that. At the end of our interview, de Guzman goes back to his job, disappearing into the mall’s mass of tiny tech repair stalls, where he sits surrounded by soldering irons, multimeters, and disassembled mobile phones. He says he loves his work and that he’s content, but as I make my way out of the  Blade Runner -esque fluorescent-lit maze of cramped computer shops, I get the feeling this isn’t where he’d imagined his life would end up. The Love Bug wasn’t the smartest computer virus, nor the most disruptive, and it certainly wasn’t the most profitable. But it’s the perfect illustration of a basic truth about much of the computer crime currently plaguing society today: It’s not about the tech, it’s about the people. Twenty years later, many of the biggest hacks and manipulations carried out on the internet—the digital burglary of Sony Pictures Entertainment, the hi-tech heist of $81 million from Bangladesh Bank, the interference in the 2016 US presidential election—aren’t, at their heart, about code, software, or hardware. They’re about exploiting human frailty. The hacker’s first step is to fool people into doing things they shouldn’t. The real trick is how to convince their victims to perform such actions, and that relies on psychological acumen every bit as much as technical skill. A good hacker needs an instinctive grasp of human behavior, and a deep understanding of our desires and fears. De Guzman was absolutely not the first person to realize this, but in naming his virus he had, almost inadvertently, come up with the greatest lure of all time. His attack succeeded and became a global menace because he hit upon the one thing sought by everyone on the planet: love. More Great WIRED Stories 📩 Want the latest on tech, science, and more?

On Thursday, Microsoft published a blog post revealing that it has seen Russia\'s Fancy Bear hackers, which Microsoft calls Strontium, targeting more than 200 organizations since September 2019. The targets include many election-adjacent organizations, according to researchers at Microsoft\'s Threat Intelligence Center, including political campaigns, advocacy groups, think tanks, political parties, and political consultants serving both Republicans and Democrats. Microsoft named the German Marshall Fund of the United States and the European People\'s Party as two of the hackers\' targets. The company otherwise declined to publicly name victims or say how many of the attempted intrusions had been successful, though it said that its security measures had prevented the majority of attacks. "The activity we are announcing today makes clear that foreign activity groups have stepped up their efforts targeting the 2020 election as had been anticipated," Microsoft\'s blog post reads. "Microsoft has been monitoring these attacks and notifying targeted customers for several months, but only recently reached a point in our investigation where we can attribute the activity to Strontium with high confidence." Reuters reported earlier today  that SKDKnickerbocker, a campaign strategy and communications firm working with presidential candidate Joseph Biden and other prominent Democrats, had received a warning from Microsoft that it had been unsuccessfully targeted by Russian hackers, without naming Fancy Bear. WIRED  reported in July  that Fancy Bear had targeted US government agencies, education institutions, and the energy sector, but without any clear intent to affect the 2020 election. Microsoft\'s blog post also details politically focused hacking campaigns by a Chinese group known as Zirconium or APT31, as well as an Iranian group known as Phosphorous or APT35. The Chinese campaign\'s attacks have included 150 successful breaches of organizations in the last six months, Microsoft\'s researchers say. They note that the hackers have attempted to target the Biden campaign—apparently without success—as well as "one individual formerly associated with the Trump administration." APT31 has also hit more run-of-the-mill espionage targets, including academics at 15 universities and staff accounts at 18 think tanks, including the Atlantic Council and the Stimson Center. The Iranian campaign, according to Microsoft, has attempted to gain access to multiple accounts of people involved in the 2020 presidential election, as well as multiple members of Trump\'s administration and campaign staff in May and June of this year. Those Trump-targeted intrusions were unsuccessful, Microsoft adds. But it\'s Russia\'s latest attacks that are the most troubling, according to threat intelligence firm FireEye. That\'s because, unlike Iran or China, the Russian military intelligence agency known as the GRU—and specifically the GRU team known as Fancy Bear, believed to be GRU Unit 26165—has a history of going beyond traditional spying to carry out political hack-and-leak operations like the ones it performed ahead of the 2016 US presidential election and the  2017 French presidential election . "We remain most concerned by Russian military intelligence, who we believe poses the greatest threat to the democratic process," reads a note FireEye sent to its customers warning about the politically focused hacking campaigns, referring to the group by the name APT28. "The targeting of political organizations is a common feature of cyber espionage. Parties and campaigns are good sources of intelligence on future policy, and it’s likely Iranian and Chinese actors targeted US campaigns to quietly collect intelligence, but APT28’s unique history raises the prospect of follow-on information operations or other devastating activity." According to Microsoft, the new round of Fancy Bear hacking also shows that the group has evolved since 2016. While it\'s still working to steal victims\' account credentials, it has moved on from the email-based spear-phishing attacks linking to fake login pages of the kind that  tricked Clinton campaign manager John Podesta  into giving the group his Gmail username and password four years ago. Instead, the group is using brute-force attacks that try large numbers of passwords against targeted users\' accounts, as well as password spraying, a technique that tries a certain number of common passwords against many different accounts. Those two tactics "have likely allowed them to automate aspects of their operations," which would let them scale up their targeting. Microsoft also notes that the hackers have evolved their attempts to avoid detection, rotating through more than a thousand IP addresses in their hacking spree, using the anonymity software Tor, and constantly jettisoning IP addresses and adding new ones. The news of Fancy Bear\'s return to the political arena comes on the heels of a complaint from a Department of Homeland Security analyst that he was  told to downplay intelligence on Russian national security threats and focus instead on Iranian and Chinese threats  to better match the Trump administration\'s political focus. Trump has, since even before his election, publicly cast doubt on reports of Russian hacking, including the 2016 election meddling that was designed to help him defeat Hillary Clinton. But while the latest Microsoft findings name Russian, Chinese, and Iranian hackers in equal measure, FireEye director of intelligence John Hultquist warns that Americans shouldn\'t fall into the trap of thinking those three potential wild cards carry equal risk for American democracy. "APT28 is the threat that really matters here," Hultquist says. "They have the history, the motivation, and the means to actually interfere."

Universal Health Services,  a hospital and health care network with more than 400 facilities across the United States, Puerto Rico, and United Kingdom, suffered a ransomware attack early Sunday morning that has taken down its digital networks at locations around the US. As the situation has spiraled, some patients have reportedly been rerouted to other emergency rooms and facilities and had appointments and test results delayed as a result of the attack. An emergency room technician at one UHS-owned facility tells WIRED that their hospital has moved to all-paper systems as a result of the attack.  Bleeping Computer , which first reported the news, spoke to UHS employees who said the ransomware has the hallmarks of Ryuk, which first appeared in 2018 and is widely linked to Russian cybercriminals. Ryuk is typically used in  so-called "big-game hunting" attacks  in which hackers attempt to extort large ransoms from corporate victims. UHS says it has 90,000 employees and treats about 3.5 million patients each year, making it one of the US\' largest hospital and health care networks. "We are using paper for everything. All computers are completely shut down," the UHS employee told WIRED. "Paper is workable, there is just a lot more documentation to be done so things don’t get lost—orders, meds, etc. Patient care is about the same still in the ER, since we are where the patient enters the hospital and the visit gets started. There is concern for patients who were already on the floors when this happened, but everyone is stepping up their game big time." "Our facilities are using their established back-up processes, including offline documentation methods," UHS said in a statement. The company did not return a request for further comment from WIRED and would not confirm that it is a ransomware attack. The company\'s statement did confirm that the "IT network across Universal Health Services facilities is currently offline, due to an IT security issue," and that patient and employee data appear not to have been compromised in the attack. Ransomware attacks on large organizations have been prevalent since the mid-2010s, but the  pace of assaults seems to have increased  in recent months. Hospitals, in particular, have long been a  favorite target , because patient safety hangs in the balance when a hospital\'s network goes down. In addition to UHS, the Ashtabula County Medical Center  in Ohio  and  Nebraska Medicine  have both suffered ransomware attacks in recent days that caused system outages and threatened patient services. And earlier this month, a patient with a life-threatening condition died in Düsseldorf, Germany, after a  ransomware attack at a nearby hospital  forced her to be taken to a more distant facility. The episode may have been the first example of a patient who died because of the fallout from a ransomware attack. "These incidents are hugely concerning; they could have fatal consequences," says Brett Callow, a threat analyst at the antivirus company Emsisoft. "I would say things are as bad as they’ve ever been—worse, in fact." Ryuk ransomware was attributed to North Korean actors when it first emerged, but many researchers  now link it  instead to Russian cybercriminals. It\'s often preceded by a phishing attack that infects a target with a trojan, then exfiltrates the victim\'s data and triggers a Ryuk infection. The ransomware seems to be used by a few splinter groups in addition to its originators, though, making it difficult to trace and correlate activity from the presence of the malware alone. The actor that first used it throughout 2018 and 2019 seemed to go dark in April, but has recently reappeared. "There are indications that the original actors are back and carrying out attacks after their absence," Emsisoft\'s Callow says. "The number of attacks is spiking, and as always they have a liking for health care along with other organizations." Ryuk is one of several large ransomware families which have hit not just health care, but other large companies like Garmin and Lenovo, the shipping and logistics firm Pitney Bowes, Tribune Publishing, and numerous municipal governments around the country. Some ransomware gangs  vowed not to hit hospitals  during the pandemic, but actors tied to Ryuk made no such promise. Some researchers are calling for a ban on paying ransoms, arguing that drastically reducing that incentive is the only measure that will stop ransomware\'s rise now. The recommendation has been controversial, though, given how high the stakes can be for returning to normal operations during an attack—especially when the target is critical infrastructure or a health-care-related organization. "This is extremely important. It\'s truly vile that people are willing to go after hospitals," the UHS ER technician told WIRED. "It is a life-or-death situation."

In Georgia, a database that verifies voter signatures was locked up by Russian  hackers  in a ransomware attack that also dumped voters’ registration data online. In California and Indiana, Russia’s most formidable state hackers, a unit linked to the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., bored into local networks and hit some election systems, though it is still unclear why. In Louisiana, the National Guard was called in to stop cyberattacks aimed at small government offices that employed tools previously seen only in attacks by North Korea. And on Tuesday night, someone  hacked the Trump campaign , defacing its website with a threatening message in broken English warning that there would be more to come. None of these attacks amounted to much. But from the sprawling war room at United States Cyber Command to those monitoring the election at Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft, experts are watching closely for more “perception hacks.” Those are smaller attacks that can be easily exaggerated into something bigger and potentially seized upon as evidence that the whole voting process is “rigged,” as President Trump has claimed it will be. The phrase comes up every time Christopher Krebs, the Department of Homeland Security official responsible for making sure voting systems are secure, talks about the biggest vulnerabilities in this election. His worry is not a vast attack but a series of smaller ones, perhaps concentrated in swing states, whose effect is more psychological than real. Perception hacks are just one of a range of issues occupying election officials and cybersecurity experts in the final days of voting — and their concerns will not end on Election Day. One theory gaining ground inside American intelligence agencies is that the Russians, having made the point that they remain inside key American systems despite bolstered defenses and new offensive operations by Cyber Command, may sit out the next week — until it is clear whether the vote is close. The Russian play, under this theory, would be to fan the flames of state-by-state election battles, generating or amplifying claims of fraud that would further undermine American confidence in the integrity of the election process. The Iranians would continue their playbook, which American intelligence officials see as more akin to vandalism than serious hacking, filled with threats in mangled English. But American experts have warned local officials that come Nov. 3 the Iranians may seek to paralyze or deface the websites of secretaries of state, affecting the reporting of results, and create the impression of being inside the voting infrastructure even if they never were and the election results have not been compromised. Here is a look at some of the potential threats and what has been learned so far in a year of behind-the-scenes cyberbattles. Protecting the Machines Government officials are trying to assure voters that voting machines are hard to hack on a large scale: They are almost entirely offline. States and counties use their own systems, and the breadth and diversity of those systems, the argument goes, make it nearly impossible for a single attack to target all of them. But that does not eliminate the risk. At the University of Michigan, J. Alex Halderman has turned his laboratory into an arcade of voting-machine vulnerabilities and found ways to create “attacks that can spread from machine to machine like a computer virus and silently change election outcomes.” Others point out that no one needs to hack every state to cause havoc. In a tight election, an attacker could target Atlanta, Philadelphia, Detroit or Milwaukee and delay the reporting of results from an electoral battleground. The other weak point in the diversity-as-security claim, election security experts say, is the constellation of contractors that support elections across multiple states and counties. “The claim that diversity is protecting the election is a logical fallacy,” said Harri Hursti, an election security consultant.  Mr. Hursti worries about a scenario in which ballot scanners could be reprogrammed to read a vote for Joseph R. Biden Jr. as a vote for Mr. Trump or vice versa. “A single point of failure could compromise election infrastructure across multiple counties and states,” Mr. Hursti warned. His concern is strictly cautionary, but not unheard-of. Not long after the 2016 election, a National Security Agency whistle-blower revealed that VR Systems, a Florida company that provided check-in software to multiple states, including critical swing states like Florida and North Carolina, was compromised by Russian hackers before the vote. There is no evidence they used that access to affect the final vote. Backups The constant drumbeat of cyberattacks and foreign interference has forced states to put safeguards in place. States have been working to print paper backups of voter registration data, and they have been phasing out machines that leave no paper backup. Mr. Krebs said that next week about 92 percent of all votes cast would be “associated” with some kind of paper record, up significantly from four years ago. But with the surge in mail-in ballots this year, machine voting will also diminish as a percentage of the total vote. So the vulnerabilities that the Homeland Security Department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is focused on are potential attacks on voter registration, verification and vote reporting systems, along with the computer networks of secretaries of state, or power outages at the polls. Those kinds of attacks would not change the vote tallies. But, executed artfully enough, especially in battleground states or key districts within those states, they could be used to sow doubt about the legitimacy of the election. Some officials still wonder if that was the motivation behind some of Russia’s 2016 interference, when hackers “scanned” the registration databases of all 50 states, breached systems in Arizona and Florida, and made an unusually noisy show of stealing voters’ registration data in Illinois but ultimately did nothing with it. Many of those vulnerabilities have been patched, thanks to an aggressive campaign by the Homeland Security Department and the states. But voting is a local affair and vulnerabilities remain, as Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida discovered when he went to vote early in Tallahassee, the state capital. Someone — the police arrested a 20-year-old from Naples, Fla. — had changed the governor’s address to West Palm Beach.  That is why there is so much concern about a Russian group called Energetic Bear. Over the years, the group, believed to be a unit of the F.S.B., has breached American power grids, water treatment plants,  a nuclear power plant in Kansas  and, more recently,  web systems at San Francisco International Airport . And starting in September, it began going into the systems of state and local governments. So far, intelligence officials say they have succeeded in breaching only two servers in California and Indiana. Ransomware The most imminent threat, officials say, is ransomware attacks that could freeze some part of the voting system and delay results.  It is a sign of how concerned the intelligence agencies and private industry are about ransomware that over the past month both Cyber Command and a group of companies led by Microsoft have been bringing down servers around the world linked to TrickBot, a set of tools used in some of the most sophisticated ransomware operations. “This is all about disrupting TrickBot’s operations during peak election activity,” said Tom Burt, the Microsoft executive in charge of the operation.  But there is already evidence that the hackers behind TrickBot have shifted to new tools, according to Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm. Over the past month and a half, researchers discovered that the same people have been directing a spate of vicious new ransomware attacks that have taken American hospitals offline, just as coronavirus cases are spiking. “They could use these same tools against whoever they want whether it’s the election or hospitals,” said Kimberly Goody, a cybercrime analyst at Mandiant. A ransomware attack in Gainesville, Ga.,  locked up the voter signature verification systems  last week, forcing poll workers to do things the old-fashioned way, pulling registration cards manually and eyeballing the signatures. The attack, which does not appear to have been directed at the election but took election systems down as collateral damage, exposed continued weak spots in Georgia,  a key battleground state . Internal emails showed that the Georgia secretary of state’s office disabled two-factor authentication in recent weeks, after its election software was buckling under the deluge of early voters. Two-factor authentication, which keeps hackers from breaking into systems with one stolen password, has been key to the Homeland Security Department’s election security strategy, and in this case emails show that the secretary of state simply turned it off. Preparing for the Aftermath Mr. Trump has already promoted the idea that mail-in ballots will be riddled with fraud and has sought to use small glitches in the distribution and return of mail ballots as evidence that the system cannot be trusted if the result goes against him. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a “public service announcement” recently about taking care to verify information before believing it or reposting it. But as some government officials concede, there is no remedy for a president who repeats unproven rumors and conspiracy theories — other than directly contradicting him. “They have walked the line carefully,” said Senator Angus King, independent of Maine. “But the real test is coming.”']} in VectorDB

A warning that  unidentified hackers broke into an agency of the US federal government and stole its data is troubling enough. But it becomes all the more disturbing when those unidentified intruders are identified—and appear likely to be part of a notorious team of cyberspies working in the service of  Russia\'s military intelligence agency , the GRU. Last week the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  published an advisory  that hackers had penetrated a US federal agency. It identified neither the attackers nor the agency, but did detail the hackers\' methods and their use of a new and unique form of malware in an operation that successfully stole target data. Now, clues uncovered by a researcher at cybersecurity firm Dragos and an FBI notification to hacking victims obtained by WIRED in July suggest a likely answer to the mystery of who was behind the intrusion: They appear to be Fancy Bear, a team of hackers working for Russia\'s GRU. Also known as APT28, the group has been responsible for everything from  hack-and-leak operations targeting the 2016 US presidential election  to a  broad campaign of attempted intrusions targeting political parties, consultancies, and campaigns  this year. "They’re a formidable actor, and they\'re still capable of getting access to sensitive areas." John Hultquist, FireEye The clues pointing to APT28 are based in part on a notification the FBI sent to targets of a hacking campaign in May of this year,  which WIRED obtained . The notification warned that APT28 was broadly targeting US networks, including government agencies and educational institutions, and listed several IP addresses they were using in their operations. Dragos researcher Joe Slowik noticed that one IP address identifying a server in Hungary used in that APT28 campaign matched an IP address listed in the CISA advisory. That would suggest that APT28 used the same Hungarian server in the intrusion described by CISA—and that at least one of the attempted intrusions described by the FBI was successful. "Based on the infrastructure overlap, the series of behaviors associated with the event, and the general timing and targeting of the US government, this seems to be something very similar to—if not a part of—the campaign linked to APT28 earlier this year," says Slowik, the former head of Los Alamos National Labs’ Computer Emergency Response Team. Aside from that FBI notification, Slowik also found a second infrastructure connection. A report last year from the Department of Energy warned that APT28 had probed a US government organization\'s network from a server in Latvia, listing that server\'s IP address. And that Latvian IP address, too, reappeared in the hacking operation described in the CISA advisory. Together, those matching IPs create a web of shared infrastructure that ties the operations together. "There are one-to-one overlaps in the two cases," Slowik says. Confusingly, some of the IP addresses listed in the FBI, DOE, and CISA documents also seem to overlap with known cybercriminal operations, Slowik notes, such as Russian fraud forums and servers used by banking trojans. But he suggests that means Russia\'s state-sponsored hackers are most likely reusing cybercriminal infrastructure, perhaps to create deniability. WIRED reached out to CISA, as well as the FBI and DOE, but none responded to our request for comment. Although it doesn\'t name APT28, CISA\'s advisory does detail step-by-step how the hackers carried out their intrusion inside an unidentified federal agency. The hackers had somehow obtained working usernames and passwords for multiple employees, which they used to gain entry onto the network. CISA admits it doesn\'t know how those credentials were obtained, but the report speculates that the attackers may have used a known vulnerability in Pulse Secure VPNs that CISA says has been exploited widely across the federal government. The intruders then used command line tools to move among the agency\'s machines, before downloading a piece of custom malware. They then used that malware to access the agency\'s file server and move collections of files to machines the hackers controlled, compressing them into .zip files they could more easily steal. While CISA didn\'t make a sample of the hackers\' custom trojan available to researchers, security researcher Costin Raiu says that the attributes of the malware matched another sample uploaded to the malware research repository VirusTotal from somewhere in the United Arab Emirates. By analyzing that sample, Raiu found that it appears to be a unique creation built from a combination of the common hacking tools Meterpreter and Cobalt Strike, but with no obvious links to known hackers, and obfuscated with multiple layers of encryption. "That wrapping makes it kind of interesting," says Raiu, director of Kaspersky\'s global research and analysis team. "It is kind of unusual and rare in the sense that we couldn’t find connections with anything else." Even aside from their 2016 breaches of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, Russia\'s APT28 hackers loom over the 2020 election. Earlier this month  Microsoft warned that the group has been carrying out mass-scale, relatively simple techniques to breach election-related organizations  and campaigns on both sides of the political aisle. According to Microsoft, the group has used a combination of password-spraying that tries common passwords across many users\' accounts and password brute-forcing that tries many passwords against a single account. But if APT28 is indeed the hacker group described in the CISA advisory, it\'s a reminder that they\'re also capable of more sophisticated and targeted spying operations, says John Hultquist, the director of intelligence at security firm FireEye, which didn\'t independently confirm Slowik\'s findings linking the CISA report to APT28. "They’re a formidable actor, and they\'re still capable of getting access to sensitive areas," says Hultquist. APT28, before its more recent hack-and-leak operations of the last few years, has a long history of espionage operations that have targeted US, NATO, and Eastern European government and military targets. The CISA advisory, along with the DOE and FBI findings that track related APT28 hacking campaigns, all suggest that those spying operations continue today. "It\'s certainly not surprising that Russian intelligence would be trying penetrate the US government. That\'s kind of what they do," says Slowik. "But it is worth identifying that not only is such activity continuing, it\'s been successful." More Great WIRED Stories 📩 Want the latest on tech, science, and more?  Sign up for our newsletters !

The indie game   Among Us  has rocketed to immense popularity  with its mix of wholesome multiplayer collaboration and devious sabotage. But it turns out that potential for treachery goes significantly deeper than the game\'s creators intended. James Sebree, a researcher for security firm Tenable, on Tuesday published a  blog post  laying out a slew of relatively simple, hackable vulnerabilities in  Among Us  that he has discovered over the past two months, allowing an extraordinary range of cheats. Some of them wreck the basic mechanics of the game, in which players collaborate on a space station while trying to identify secret impostors who are simultaneously trying to sabotage and kill them. Sebree says his hacks have, for instance, allowed him to kill players at will, impersonate other players, teleport around the game, walk through walls, supercharge his character\'s speed, control the movements of other players, obtain paid in-game items for free, ban players without being the host, or remove a ban on himself. Sebree says that he and some friends who are fans of the game initially started looking into its code in late September, with the goal of modifying it to allow more than the default 10 players. But he quickly found that the potential to alter the game went far further. "When I started digging into it I noticed these other issues and tried to give them a shot,"  Sebree says, "and I saw that all these things were possible." The crux of the game\'s security bugs, Sebree says, is that its servers aren\'t designed to validate information sent by the game client running on the players\' computers, a basic safeguard against cheating in most popular PC games. Sebree was able to reverse-engineer the game\'s code using the tools dnSpy and IL2CPP and create a modified version of the game client that sent the server all sorts of spoofed or altered data. "Say I\'m player one, but I send a command to move as player two," Sebree says. "Player two will move instead." Sebree is far from the first to hack  Among Us , though he may be the first to do so this comprehensively and publicly. Players have  complained  of  hacking and cheating  in  Among Us  since at least early October. (The game also has a problem with analog cheating when players collude on external channels.) Some players were also hit with a  deluge of pro-Trump spam in mid-October . Sebree says he was able to replicate that attack, sending messages as other players by exploiting the same lack of server-side validation of a message\'s sender. WIRED reached out to Innersloth, the small game developer behind  Among Us , and the company responded that it\'s looking into the issues. Sebree says he tried to get in touch with Innersloth repeatedly in mid-October to share his findings but got no response. He does note that a few of the hacks he highlighted have since been fixed, such as changing the color of your character, immediately identifying the impostor, or killing other players instantly. (Another hack for killing opponents—calling for a meeting and forcing all the other players to vote to throw the victim out of the airlock—still works, Sebree says.) He also concedes that he hasn\'t tested a few of the cheats in several weeks, such as banning other players, removing bans, or reviving dead players, but the other hacking techniques all remain unfixed. Although all of the hacks he publicized are a result of the lack of server-side validation of data, Sebree says that different kinds of data likely require adding their own validation rather than a single blanket fix. Given that Innersloth has only three people listed on the "team" page of its website, it\'s perhaps not surprising that it doesn\'t have the resources to dig up and repair every hackable vulnerability in the game, says Sebree. He argues that the sort of basic bugs he uncovered are bound to occur in indie games like  Among Us  that are built by a skeleton crew of developers, using tools like the Unity engine to reduce the barriers to game building. Sebree\'s  blog post  points to a similar collection of  cheating techniques  for  another indie game,  Fall Guys , that allow players to fly, teleport, and move at hyperspeed. Sebree admits that the security vulnerabilities he found in  Among Us  hardly represent a serious threat to users. They don\'t, for instance, allow access to anything on a target player\'s computer beyond the confines of the game. "It\'s very unlikely someone is going to be hacked and have their identity stolen because they were playing  Among Us ," he says. "But it’s definitely possible to troll people or ruin the fun for them." In order not to enable that sort of cheating and spoiling, Sebree says he left out certain instructions from his blog post that would allow others to easily replicate his hacks. But he nonetheless wants his findings to help spur indie developers to better secure their games, including  Among Us . With some software fixes, he hopes, the game\'s underhanded acts of skullduggery will be limited again to in-game impostors rather than the kind whose acts of sabotage dig into the code of the game itself.

Ever since Volkswagen was caught five years ago using illegal software to conceal the fact that its “clean diesels” were actually rolling pollution machines, the company has insisted that the wrongdoing was the work of lower-level employees. Managers at the very top were clueless, Volkswagen’s lawyers have said. On Wednesday, prosecutors in Munich will challenge that assertion in court for the first time. They will begin presenting evidence in the trial of  Rupert Stadler , a former chief executive of Volkswagen’s Audi luxury car division. As a member of Volkswagen’s management board, he belonged to the top echelon. The trial is the first in Germany stemming from the scandal, the culmination of an exhaustive investigation involving hundreds of witnesses and millions of documents. But the case will also test whether prosecutors can overcome the difficulties inherent in trying to convict top managers protected by layers of underlings. That is a problem that has also frustrated investigators in the United States when prosecuting corporate crime. Mr. Stadler faces charges of fraud and false advertising stemming from accusations that Audi continued to sell diesel cars with illegal software even after U.S. authorities uncovered the cheating in 2015. Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche cars were programmed to meet air-quality standards while being tested, but they spewed copious amounts of diesel fumes in regular driving. Mr. Stadler and three co-defendants, including  Wolfgang Hatz , a former head of engine development at Audi, will be the first of dozens of former employees of Volkswagen to face trial in Germany in connection with the scandal.

Lucy Nicholson/Reuters Mr. Stadler, who could get five years in prison if convicted, is the second-highest-ranking manager to face charges after Martin Winterkorn, a former Volkswagen chief executive, whose trial is expected next year. Mr. Stadler, Mr. Winterkorn and Mr. Hatz have denied wrongdoing. The panel of judges in the case will hear evidence in a high-security Munich courtroom once used to try terrorists; it was chosen because it is large enough to allow social distancing. The court has scheduled more than 180 days of testimony and legal arguments lasting until the end of 2022, an indication of the complexity of the case. Even when the corporate wrongdoing is extensive it is often difficult to prove criminal culpability among top management. There is rarely a paper trail, and executives point fingers at one another to deflect blame. Middle managers usually wind up taking the fall, or top executives walk away with civil penalties, as has often been the case with  bankers  accused of cheating their customers. Serious jail time is rare. Probably for that reason, German prosecutors are focusing on Mr. Stadler’s actions after the American  Environmental Protection Agency  formally accused Volkswagen of emissions violations in September 2015, when he could no longer plausibly maintain that he was unaware of the cheating. Even though Volkswagen admitted wrongdoing, Audi claimed that its diesels were legal and continued to sell them in Europe for two more years. But those cars also proved to be fitted with illegal software. Mr. Stadler, 57, has already spent four and a half months in pretrial detention, which can be imposed if there is evidence the defendant intends to flee or interfere with the investigation. Audi has paid a fine of 800 million euros, or $930 million, for violations of German law and is not a defendant in the trial. But the testimony will focus renewed attention on the division, Volkswagen’s cash cow, and its prominent role in the genesis of the fraud. Audi said in a statement that it was glad that the facts of the case would be determined by a court of law. “Audi has become a different company since the diesel crisis became known,” the company said. The company has not taken a position on the charges faced by its former chief executive. Image Martin Winterkorn, Volkswagen’s former chief executive, in 2017.

Odd Andersen/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Audi engineers invented the cheating software and exported it to the rest of Volkswagen, according to internal company documents previously reported by The New York Times and other news organizations. In the early 2000s, engineers at Audi found that technology needed to make diesel models compliant with emissions standards caused the engine to run noisily when it was warming up. That would bother Audi’s affluent customers, executives thought. So the Audi engineers devised software that could recognize when a car was undergoing an official emissions test, using parameters such as the amount of pressure on the gas pedal. Under test conditions the software, known as the “acoustic function,” optimized the emissions controls to make the car temporarily compliant. At other times the software reduced the controls to minimize noise — producing illegal amounts of poisonous nitrogen oxides as a result. Audi employees and managers were well aware that what they were doing was illegal, according to emails and other documents seen by The Times. “We won’t make it without  a few dirty tricks ,” an employee in Audi’s diesel motor development department wrote in an email to colleagues in January 2008. Audi managers and engineers bluntly discussed what was in effect a criminal conspiracy, using terms like “defeat device” or “cycle beating” that clearly connote illegal attempts to thwart regulators’ tests. In 2006 Volkswagen engineers adapted the acoustic function software when they ran into problems developing a new diesel engine that could meet emissions standards in the United States, where the company planned a major “clean diesel” marketing campaign. The cars could not deliver on the clean diesel promise without causing excessive wear and tear on the engine. Volkswagen engineers, with the help of the supplier Robert Bosch, refined the software developed by Audi to recognize the distinctive driving pattern that U.S. regulators used when conducting emissions spot checks. Only then were the pollution controls fully deployed. Volkswagen sold almost 600,000 cars in the United States with cheating software, including 80,000 with engines built by Audi. Volkswagen gave up selling diesels in the United States after the scandal came to light, and has been trying to remake itself as a pioneer in  affordable electric vehicles . In line with German privacy rules, prosecutors publicly identified only Mr. Stadler among the four co-defendants because he is considered a public figure. But the names of two of the others have been widely reported. They are Mr. Hatz and  Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , 63, who was head of thermodynamics in Audi’s engine development department and is cooperating with the authorities. The fourth defendant was identified only as Henning L., a 52-year-old engineer. Mr. Hatz, 61, rivals Mr. Stadler in prominence. He was head of engine development at Audi while the acoustic function was being devised, and was later promoted to head of engine development for all of Volkswagen. Mr. Hatz later became head of research and development at Porsche, which belongs to Volkswagen, a job that made him a celebrity among  sports car buffs .

Nikita Teryoshin for The New York Times The only Volkswagen employees to be convicted in connection with the scandal so far were apprehended in the United States. James Liang , an engineer who worked for Volkswagen in California, received a 40-month sentence after pleading guilty in 2017 to conspiracy to defraud the United States and violating the Clean Air Act. Mr. Liang was released last November, prison records indicate. Oliver Schmidt , who worked as Volkswagen’s liaison with American regulators, was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2017 after pleading guilty to charges that he helped  cover up  the wrongdoing. Mr. Schmidt was released last week, prison records indicate. The German edition of the  Business Insider  website reported Monday that Mr. Schmidt was transferred to Germany, where he is expected to be placed on probation. Germany does not extradite its own citizens, so other  suspects  are safe from justice in the United States if they do not leave the country.']} in VectorDB

Apple  agreed on Wednesday to pay $113 million  to settle an investigation by more than 30 states into its past practice of  secretly slowing down older iPhones  to preserve their battery life. Apple’s practice of throttling phones was a black eye for the company when it was revealed in 2017, seeming to confirm some customers’ suspicions that their devices got slower when Apple released new phones. Apple said at the time that its software had slowed down phones with older batteries to prevent them from shutting off unexpectedly. Apple offered some customers free battery replacements in response to the controversy. As part of its settlement with the states, Apple must be more transparent about how it manages battery life on its devices.

Usually when you  hear about malicious activity on Facebook it\'s tied up in  geopolitical skulduggery  of some sort. But on Thursday the company detailed a campaign out of China that wasn\'t focused on disinformation or stealing account data. The hackers instead stole user credentials and gained access to their accounts toward a different goal: hawking diet pills, sexual health products, and fake designer handbags, shoes, and sunglasses. Once inside a compromised Facebook user\'s account, the attackers would use the associated payment method to purchase malicious ads, ultimately draining $4 million from victims during their spree. Facebook first detected the attacks in late 2018, and after extensive investigation the company  filed a civil suit  against a firm, ILikeAd Media International Company Ltd., and two Chinese nationals that allegedly developed the malware and ran the attacks. Today at the digital Virus Bulletin security conference, Facebook researchers presented a detailed picture of how the malware, dubbed SilentFade, actually works and some of its novel methods, including proactively blocking a user\'s notifications so the victim wouldn\'t be aware that anything was amiss. "We first discovered SilentFade in December 2018 when a suspicious traffic spike across a number of Facebook end points indicated a possible malware-based account compromise attack for ad fraud," Facebook malware researcher Sanchit Karve said on a call with reporters ahead of his Virus Bulletin presentation. "SilentFade would steal Facebook credentials and cookies from various browser credential stores. Accounts that had access to a linked payment method would then be used to run ads on Facebook." The attackers couldn\'t access actual credit card numbers or payment account details from Facebook, but once inside an account they could use whatever payment method Facebook had on file, if any, to buy ads. Facebook later reimbursed an unspecified number of users for the $4 million in fraudulent ad charges. SilentFade was often distributed by bundling it in with pirated copies of name-brand software; when a victim downloaded the program they wanted, their device would also be infected with SilentFade. From there the malware would look for special Facebook cookies in Chrome, Firefox, and other popular browsers. These cookies were valuable to the attackers, because they contain "session tokens" that are generated after a user logs in with their username, password, and any required two-factor authentication inputs. If you can grab a session token, you get an easy way to waltz into someone\'s Facebook account without needing anything else. If the malware couldn\'t find the right cookies, it would directly collect a user\'s Facebook login credentials, but would still need to decrypt them. The attackers would even set up their systems to appear to be in the same general region that the victim was in when they generated their session token. This way Facebook would think the activity was just a normal login from the user going about their day and not suspicious activity from a different region. SilentFade had other sneaky tactics too. It proactively turned off Facebook notifications on a victim\'s account so they wouldn\'t be warned about a new login or see alerts or messages about ad campaigns being run from their accounts. And it even exploited a vulnerability in Facebook\'s validation mechanisms to make it impossible for users to turn their "Login Alerts" and "Facebook Business pages" notifications back on. Facebook says it worked quickly to patch the bug and stop this novel persistence method. In addition to all of these tricks, the attackers also used obfuscation techniques on the ad network side to mask the true content of their ads by submitting different materials and source websites for review than what they later slotted into the ads that ran. Here\'s the Malware You Should Actually Worry About By  Lily Hay Newman "They used a variety of cloaking mechanisms and traffic redirection to hide their traces," said Rob Leathern, Facebook\'s director of product management. "These cloaking techniques are ones that camouflage the true intended landing page website by dynamically changing them during and after the ad review process so they show different sites to users than they do to our ad review process. The content of the ads often featured celebrities as a tactic to garner attention. Internally this is something we call \'celeb-bait,\' and it’s an issue that has dogged the online ad industry for well over a decade." Facebook has teams that work to catch these bait-and-switch ad operations, but Leathern says it\'s challenging to do so in an automated way. The SilentFade attackers also had the particular advantage of running their ads from innocent accounts that likely did not have a negative reputation or previous suspicious activity associated with them. This made it easier for the malicious ads to run undetected. In a way it\'s hard to imagine that with such a clever scheme and so much account access the actors were really simply trying to sell knockoff sunglasses. Facebook can only trace the activity so far, and the researchers noted that it\'s not totally clear what happened to users who clicked the malicious ads. But the indicators they have support the idea that the hackers really were simply trying to monetize their scam to sell counterfeit goods. Or it\'s possible that the actors behind SilentFade got a commission from other vendors for helping them make sales. Facebook says that since it patched the vulnerability SilentFade was exploiting to suppress account notifications, the platform has seen a marked drop-off in the malware\'s use. But the company says that variants have also been used to target other large tech platforms, including Twitter and more recently Amazon. Twitter and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In mid-2018, months before Facebook first detected SilentFade, researchers from the security firm Radware  published findings  on a different Facebook credential-harvesting campaign that Facebook now says was created by the same China-based actor. Distributed through phishing emails, this other malware, dubbed Stresspaint, came bundled with a drawing application called Relieve Stress Paint that would grab Facebook users\' credentials and cookies from browsers using similar techniques to those used by SilentFade. Radware found that in less than five days the attackers had infected more than 40,000 targets. Facebook says that after Radware published its findings, the actor paused its activity for a few months, but it then resumed with SilentFade, a more sophisticated evolution that included the notification-blocking features. "When we saw the Stresspaint malware almost two and a half years ago, we didn’t see the full picture of this group, because we couldn\'t see them performing all of these operations," says Adi Raff, a product manager at Radware. "But Facebook can see what they were doing on their platform. The group itself seems very sophisticated. It\'s been active for almost four years, and it\'s developed a number of different variations of malware with different capabilities. They did a lot in those four years." Ad fraud is a problem on every platform, but it\'s rare to see this kind of sophisticated compromise happen on Facebook. Given the level of access the attackers were able to achieve and maintain, it\'s almost fortunate that they seemingly set their sights so low. This story has been updated to include comment from Radware. More Great WIRED Stories 📩 Want the latest on tech, science, and more?  Sign up for our newsletters !

Earlier this week,  the US Department of Justice   unsealed an indictment   against a group of hackers known as   Sandworm . The document charged six hackers working for Russia's GRU military intelligence agency with computer crimes related to half a decade of cyberattacks across the globe, from   sabotaging the 2018 Winter Olympics   in Korea to unleashing the   most destructive malware in history   in Ukraine. Among those acts of cyberwar was an   unprecedented attack on Ukraine's power grid in 2016 , one that appeared designed to not merely cause a blackout, but to   inflict physical damage on electric equipment . And when one cybersecurity researcher named Mike Assante dug into the details of that attack, he recognized a grid-hacking idea invented not by Russian hackers, but by the United State government, and tested a decade earlier. The following excerpt from the book   SANDWORM: A New Era of Cyberwar and the Hunt for the Kremlin's Most Dangerous Hackers , published in paperback this week, tells the story of that early, seminal grid-hacking experiment. The demonstration was led by Assante, the late, legendary industrial control systems security pioneer. It would come to be known as the Aurora Generator Test. Today, it still serves as a powerful warning of the potential physical-world effects of cyberattacks—and an eery premonition of Sandworm's attacks to come. On a piercingly  cold and windy morning in March 2007, Mike Assante arrived at an Idaho National Laboratory facility 32 miles west of Idaho Falls, a building in the middle of a vast, high desert landscape covered with snow and sagebrush. He walked into an auditorium inside the visitors’ center, where a small crowd was gathering. The group included officials from the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy, and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), executives from a handful of electric utilities across the country, and other researchers and engineers who, like Assante, were tasked by the national lab to spend their days imagining catastrophic threats to American critical infrastructure.

At the front of the room was an array of video monitors and data feeds, set up to face the room’s stadium seating, like mission control at a rocket launch. The screens showed live footage from several angles of a massive diesel generator. The machine was the size of a school bus, a mint green, gargantuan mass of steel weighing 27 tons, about as much as an M3 Bradley tank. It sat a mile away from its audience in an electrical substation, producing enough electricity to power a hospital or a navy ship and emitting a steady roar. Waves of heat coming off its surface rippled the horizon in the video feed’s image. Assante and his fellow INL researchers had bought the generator for $300,000 from an oil field in Alaska. They’d shipped it thousands of miles to the Idaho test site, an 890-square-mile piece of land where the national lab maintained a sizable power grid for testing purposes, complete with 61 miles of transmission lines and seven electrical substations. Now, if Assante had done his job properly, they were going to destroy it. And the assembled researchers planned to kill that very expensive and resilient piece of machinery not with any physical tool or weapon but with about 140 kilobytes of data, a file smaller than the average cat GIF shared today on Twitter. Three years earlier,  Assante had been the chief security officer at American Electric Power, a utility with millions of customers in 11 states from Texas to Kentucky. A former navy officer turned cybersecurity engineer, Assante had long been keenly aware of the potential for hackers to attack the power grid. But he was dismayed to see that most of his peers in the electric utility industry had a relatively simplistic view of that still-theoretical and distant threat. If hackers did somehow get deep enough into a utility’s network to start opening circuit breakers, the industry’s common wisdom at the time was that staff could simply kick the intruders out of the network and flip the power back on. “We could manage it like a storm,” Assante remembers his colleagues saying. “The way it was imagined, it would be like an outage and we’d recover from the outage, and that was the limit of thinking around the risk model.” But Assante, who had a rare level of crossover expertise between the architecture of power grids and computer security, was nagged by a more devious thought. What if attackers didn’t merely hijack the control systems of grid operators to flip switches and cause short-term blackouts, but instead reprogrammed the automated elements of the grid, components that made their own decisions about grid operations without checking with any human? An electrical substation at Idaho National Labs’ sprawling, 890-square-mile test site. \n Courtesy of Idaho National Laboratory In particular, Assante had been thinking about a piece of equipment called a protective relay. Protective relays are designed to function as a safety mechanism to guard against dangerous physical conditions in electric systems. If lines overheat or a generator goes out of sync, it’s those protective relays that detect the anomaly and open a circuit breaker, disconnecting the trouble spot, saving precious hardware, even preventing fires. A protective relay functions as a kind of lifeguard for the grid. But what if that protective relay could be paralyzed—or worse, corrupted so that it became the vehicle for an attacker’s payload? That disturbing question was one Assante had carried over to Idaho National Laboratory from his time at the electric utility. Now, in the visitor center of the lab’s test range, he and his fellow engineers were about to put his most malicious idea into practice. The secret experiment was given a code name that would come to be synonymous with the potential for digital attacks to inflict physical consequences: Aurora. The test director  read out the time: 11:33 am. He checked with a safety engineer that the area around the lab’s diesel generator was clear of bystanders. Then he sent a go-ahead to one of the cybersecurity researchers at the national lab’s office in Idaho Falls to begin the attack. Like any real digital sabotage, this one would be performed from miles away, over the internet. The test’s simulated hacker responded by pushing roughly 30 lines of code from his machine to the protective relay connected to the bus-sized diesel generator. The inside of that generator, until that exact moment of its sabotage, had been performing a kind of invisible, perfectly harmonized dance with the electric grid to which it was connected. Diesel fuel in its chambers was aerosolized and detonated with inhuman timing to move pistons that rotated a steel rod inside the generator’s engine—the full assembly was known as the “prime mover”—roughly 600 times a minute. That rotation was carried through a rubber grommet, designed to reduce any vibration, and then into the electricity-generating components: a rod with arms wrapped in copper wiring, housed between two massive magnets so that each rotation induced electrical current in the wires. Spin that mass of wound copper fast enough and it produced 60 hertz of alternating current, feeding its power into the vastly larger grid to which it was connected. A protective relay attached to that generator was designed to prevent it from connecting to the rest of the power system without first syncing to that exact rhythm: 60 hertz. But Assante’s hacker in Idaho Falls had just reprogrammed that safeguard device, flipping its logic on its head. At 11:33 am and 23 seconds, the protective relay observed that the generator was perfectly synced. But then its corrupted brain did the opposite of what it was meant to do: It opened a circuit breaker to disconnect the machine. When the generator was detached from the larger circuit of Idaho National Laboratory’s electrical grid and relieved of the burden of sharing its energy with that vast system, it instantly began to accelerate, spinning faster, like a pack of horses that had been let loose from its carriage. As soon as the protective relay observed that the generator’s rotation had sped up to be fully out of sync with the rest of the grid, its maliciously flipped logic immediately reconnected it to the grid’s machinery. The moment the diesel generator was again linked to the larger system, it was hit with the wrenching force of every other rotating generator on the grid. All of that equipment pulled the relatively small mass of the diesel generator’s own spinning components back to its original, slower speed to match its neighbors’ frequencies. On the visitor center’s screens, the assembled audience watched the giant machine shake with sudden, terrible violence, emitting a sound like a deep crack of a whip. The entire process from the moment the malicious code had been triggered to that first shudder had spanned only a fraction of a second. Black chunks began to fly out of an access panel on the generator, which the researchers had left open to watch its internals. Inside, the black rubber grommet that linked the two halves of the generator’s shaft was tearing itself apart. A few seconds later, the machine shook again as the protective relay code repeated its sabotage cycle, disconnecting the machine and reconnecting it out of sync. This time a cloud of gray smoke began to spill out of the generator, perhaps the result of the rubber debris burning inside it. Assante, despite the months of effort and millions of dollars in federal funds he’d spent developing the attack they were witnessing, somehow felt a kind of sympathy for the machine as it was being torn apart from within. “You find yourself rooting for it, like the little engine that could,” Assante remembered. “I was thinking, ‘You can make it!’” The machine did not make it. After a third hit, it released a larger cloud of gray smoke. “That prime mover is toast,” an engineer standing next to Assante said. After a fourth blow, a plume of black smoke rose from the machine 30 feet into the air in a final death rattle.

The test director ended the experiment and disconnected the ruined generator from the grid one final time, leaving it deathly still. In the forensic analysis that followed, the lab’s researchers would find that the engine shaft had collided with the engine’s internal wall, leaving deep gouges in both and filling the inside of the machine with metal shavings. On the other side of the generator, its wiring and insulation had melted and burned. The machine was totaled. In the wake of the demonstration, a silence fell over the visitor center. “It was a sober moment,” Assante remembers. The engineers had just proven without a doubt that hackers who attacked an electric utility could go beyond a temporary disruption of the victim’s operations: They could damage its most critical equipment beyond repair. “It was so vivid. You could imagine it happening to a machine in an actual plant, and it would be terrible,” Assante says. “The implication was that with just a few lines of code, you can create conditions that were physically going to be very damaging to the machines we rely on.” But Assante also remembers feeling something weightier in the moments after the Aurora experiment. It was a sense that, like Robert Oppenheimer watching the first atomic bomb test at another US national lab six decades earlier, he was witnessing the birth of something historic and immensely powerful. “I had a very real pit in my stomach,” Assante says. “It was like a glimpse of the future.” From the book \xa0 Sandworm: A New Era of Cyberwar and the Hunt for the Kremlin's Most Dangerous Hackers .

This incident has affected more than 400 UHS facilities. Although patient and employee data do not appear to have been compromised, the attack has disrupted operations, causing delays in appointments, rerouting of patients to other facilities, and the implementation of offline documentation methods. The responsible entity for this software failure incident is currently unknown, but some employees have suggested that the ransomware used in the attack, which exhibits characteristics of Ryuk and is associated with Russian cybercriminals, is to blame. UHS, along with other hospitals like Ashtabula County Medical Center in Ohio and Nebraska Medicine, have become favorite targets for ransomware attacks due to the critical nature of patient safety when hospital networks are compromised. The impact of this incident emphasizes the need for enhanced cybersecurity measures within healthcare organizations. [306]

2023-10-03 16:31:07,712 INFO: On September 28, 2020, Universal Health Services (UHS), a hospital and health care network with over 400 facilities, experienced a ransomware attack that resulted in the shutdown of its digital networks across multiple locations in the US, Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom. The specific system that failed was the IT network, which became offline due to an IT security issue. While UHS did not confirm it as a ransomware attack, the attack showed characteristics similar to Ryuk ransomware, associated with Russian cybercriminals. Patient and employee data were not compromised, but the incident led to disruptions in patient care, with some patients being rerouted to other facilities and delays in appointments and test results. UHS responded by implementing offline documentation methods and transitioning to all-paper systems in some hospitals. The responsible entity for the attack remains unknown, but hospitals, including UHS, have been frequent targets due to the potential impact on patient safety. [306]

2023-10-03 16:54:23,432 INFO: The software failure incident occurred on an early Sunday morning at Universal Health Services (UHS), a hospital and healthcare network with more than 400 facilities in the US, Puerto Rico, and the UK. The incident involved a ransomware attack that targeted UHS's IT network, causing it to go offline. The specific cause of the attack is yet to be confirmed, although there are suspicions that it may be a result of the Ryuk ransomware, commonly used by Russian cybercriminals. As a result of the attack, UHS had to resort to offline documentation methods and all-paper systems in some of their facilities, leading to delays in appointments, test results, and patients being rerouted to other emergency rooms and healthcare facilities. While patient and employee data had not been compromised, the attack had a significant impact on the organization's digital networks and operations. UHS is the responsible entity for this incident, and it has affected both the organization itself and the patients who were already in the facilities at the time of the attack. [306]

The attack occurred before the vote, but there is no evidence to suggest that the hackers used their access to manipulate the final vote. The incident exposed the weak spots within Georgia's election system, primarily attributed to the disabling of two-factor authentication by the Georgia secretary of state's office. Additionally, the leak of Windows XP source code, an operating system that stopped receiving official updates in 2014, has caused multiple security problems due to unpatched vulnerabilities. Intelligence officials have successfully breached servers in California and Indiana, with the most imminent threat being ransomware attacks that could freeze parts of the voting system and delay results. The responsible entities for these incidents include the Russian hackers, VR Systems, the Georgia secretary of state's office, and the unidentified individuals behind the leak of Windows XP source code. The impacted entities are the states that relied on VR Systems' check-in software, Georgia as a key battleground state, and the millions of computers still running Windows XP. [298, 143]

2023-10-03 16:55:45,436 INFO: In an unidentified federal agency, a software failure incident occurred when hackers successfully intruded and gained entry onto the network using obtained usernames and passwords of agency employees. The exact method of obtaining these credentials is unknown, but it is speculated that a known vulnerability in Pulse Secure VPNs, widely exploited across the federal government, may have been utilized. The hackers proceeded to use command line tools to navigate through the agency's machines and downloaded a custom malware. This malware was then used to access the agency's file server and transfer files to machines controlled by the hackers. The files were compressed into .zip files for easier stealing. The software failure incident occurred on an unspecified date. The system that failed was the agency's network security. The cause of the failure was the successful intrusion of hackers exploiting vulnerabilities and obtaining employee credentials. The impact of the failure included the stealing of sensitive data from the agency. The responsible entity for the incident is the unidentified federal agency, while the impacted entity is also the same agency. [188]

2023-10-03 16:56:24,675 INFO: In this software failure incident, it was discovered that the indie game Among Us had several hackable vulnerabilities that allowed for a range of cheats. These vulnerabilities were discovered by James Sebree, a researcher for security firm Tenable, over the past two months. The failures occurred within the game itself, specifically the lack of server-side validation of a message's sender. This lack of validation allowed players to exploit the system and perform actions such as killing players at will, impersonating other players, and controlling the movements of other players. The impact of these failures resulted in the disruption of the game's basic mechanics and compromised the integrity of the gameplay. The responsible entity in this case is the game developer, Innersloth, who has been made aware of the issues and is looking into them. The impacted entity is the player base of Among Us, who have experienced disruptions and unfair gameplay as a result of these vulnerabilities. [35]

2023-10-03 16:56:59,131 INFO: In January 2008, it was discovered that Audi, a subsidiary of Volkswagen, had installed cheating software in its diesel engines in an attempt to deceive regulators' emissions tests. This software failure occurred as a result of a criminal conspiracy within Audi's diesel motor development department, where managers and engineers discussed the use of terms like "defeat device" and "cycle beating" to illegally manipulate emissions data. The impact of this failure was significant, leading to Volkswagen giving up selling diesel vehicles in the United States after the scandal was revealed. Audi has paid a fine of 800 million euros for violations of German law. The responsible entity for this failure is Audi, and the impacted entity is Volkswagen, as it suffered reputational and financial damage. [311]

2023-10-03 16:57:15,543 INFO: Based on the given context, it appears that the software failure incident in question is related to the "cheating software" used by Volkswagen and Audi to manipulate emissions tests. It is not explicitly mentioned what could have prevented this software failure incident, but potential preventive measures could have included:

1. Strict adherence to legal and regulatory standards: By developing and deploying software solutions that fully complied with emissions standards set by regulators, Volkswagen and Audi could have prevented the need for cheating software.

2. Thorough testing and quality assurance: Proper testing and quality assurance processes could have identified the issues with the diesel engine's emissions and allowed for addressing them before production, thereby avoiding the software failure incident.

3. Ethical conduct and corporate responsibility: If the companies had chosen to prioritize ethics and corporate responsibility over illegal actions, they could have avoided the software failure incident altogether.

4. Transparency and accountability: Establishing a culture of transparency and holding individuals accountable for their actions could have discouraged the development and implementation of cheating software.

Overall, it is important to note that the provided context refers to a specific incident related to manipulating emissions tests, so the preventive measures mentioned may not be applicable to all types of software failure incidents. [311]

2023-10-03 16:58:13,836 INFO: The software failure incident, known as SilentFade, occurred in December 2018 and affected Facebook's platform. The system that failed was Facebook's security measures, as it was unable to detect and prevent a malware-based account compromise attack for ad fraud. The failure was caused by a sophisticated malware named SilentFade, which employed novel methods such as proactively blocking user notifications to hide its malicious activities. The impact of the failure was significant, with over 40,000 targets being infected within five days. The responsible entity behind the attack was a China-based actor, who also created a previous malware called Stresspaint. Both SilentFade and Stresspaint were designed to harvest Facebook users' credentials and cookies through phishing techniques. The entities impacted by this software failure were the Facebook users whose accounts were compromised and the overall integrity and security of Facebook's platform. [163]

2023-10-03 16:58:22,710 INFO: The software failure incident led to a malware attack called SilentFade, which infected more than 40,000 targets within five days. The attackers used SilentFade to suppress account notifications on Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon. Facebook patched the vulnerability, resulting in a decrease in SilentFade's use on their platform. However, SilentFade evolved and continued to target other large tech platforms. The incident also involved the attackers using obfuscation techniques on the ad network side to manipulate the content of their ads. [163]

2023-10-03 16:58:44,859 INFO: In this software failure incident, the failure occurred during a test at the national lab's office in Idaho Falls. The system that failed was the automated elements of the power grid. The cause of failure was a reprogramming of these components by attackers. The impact of the failure was severe damage to critical equipment, including a diesel generator which emitted smoke and suffered internal damage. The responsible entity for the attack was the hackers who targeted the electric utility. The impacted entity was the electric utility, as their operations were disrupted and their equipment was damaged beyond repair. [159]

2023-10-03 16:59:15,326 INFO: The software failure incident occurred in two separate crashes involving the Boeing 737 Max. The first crash happened in October 2018 in Indonesia, resulting in the death of all 189 passengers and crew members. The second crash occurred five months later in Ethiopia. In both incidents, the failure was attributed to faulty software that relied on a single sensor. The software would repeatedly push down the plane's nose, causing the aircraft to go haywire if not responded to within 10 seconds. The impact of this software failure was catastrophic, leading to the loss of all lives on board in both crashes. The responsible entity for the software failure was Boeing, as it was discovered that the company's executives and engineers did not take warning signs seriously enough, neglected additional precautions, and prioritized cost-saving or profit-raising decisions. The entity impacted by the software failure was the aviation industry as a whole, as trust in the safety of the Boeing 737 Max was heavily shaken, leading to widespread grounding of the aircraft and significant reputational damage for Boeing.

2023-10-03 16:59:49,576 INFO: In this incident, the software failure occurred in the Cash App, a popular instant payment app, which resulted in customers falling victim to fraud. The failure was caused by a marketing campaign called "Cash App Fridays," which provided fraudsters with a phone book of potential victims. This, combined with the lack of a phone support line for customers, allowed scammers to trick users into downloading malicious software that took control of their accounts and drained their funds. The impact of the failure was financial loss for the affected customers, who had to endure financial difficulties until they were paid the following week. The responsible entity for this failure is Square, the company behind Cash App, as they had not provided adequate customer support and had implemented a campaign that made users vulnerable to scams. The impacted entity is the users of Cash App who fell victim to the fraud. [202]

2023-10-03 17:00:47,186 INFO: In late 2015, a group of hackers associated with China's main intelligence service infiltrated more than 100 companies and organizations worldwide, including gaming companies and various industries in the United States, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. This group, initially known as Wicked Spider, shifted their focus from hacking for profit to conducting supply chain attacks. They used a supply chain attack methodology to embed malicious code in software products of targeted companies. Once these compromised products were installed in other systems, the hackers could exploit the code to breach and gain unauthorized access to these systems. The impact of this software failure was significant, with the hackers infiltrating multiple sectors such as agriculture, hospitality, chemicals, manufacturing, and technology, aiming to steal intellectual property aligned with China's official Five-Year Plan. The responsibility for the incident lies with the hackers associated with China's main intelligence service, while the impacted entities are the companies and organizations targeted in the cyber-espionage campaign.

2023-10-03 17:02:00,079 INFO: Based on the given context, the software failure incident could have been prevented if the following actions were taken:

1. Keeping software and browsers up to date: If individuals had been using the latest version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, the hackers would not have been able to exploit the vulnerability in the older version.

2. Implementing strong security measures: Strong security measures, such as robust firewall configurations, intrusion detection systems, and regular vulnerability assessments, could have detected and prevented the hackers from infiltrating the Wi-Fi network and injecting malicious code.

3. Employee training and awareness: By educating employees about the risks of phishing emails and social engineering tactics, organizations could have reduced the likelihood of employees inadvertently giving access to critical systems.

4. Enhanced malware protection: Updating and regularly scanning machines with effective anti-malware software could have detected and prevented the malware from being downloaded onto the machines.

It is important to note that these preventive measures are based on the given context and may not be an exhaustive list of all possible preventive actions. [160]

2023-10-03 17:02:27,244 INFO: In a recent study conducted by researchers from Münster University, several smartwatches were found to have serious software failures. The study focused on six smartwatches sold by JBC, Polywell, Starlian, Pingonaut, ANIO, and Xplora. These smartwatches suffered from vulnerabilities, including SQL injection flaws and the lack of TLS encryption in their communications. These flaws could have allowed hackers to access and intercept user data, such as location information and audio messages. The failure occurred in the backend server architecture of these smartwatches, which were provided by a white label manufacturer. The responsible entity for the failure seems to be the manufacturer, as they provided the flawed hardware and software. The impacted entities are the users of these smartwatches, who had their sensitive information at risk. This incident raises concerns about the lack of security measures implemented in these devices, despite previous research and recalls being conducted on similar products. [295]

2023-10-03 17:03:04,438 INFO: The software failure incident occurred in September 2015 when it was discovered that Volkswagen had been manufacturing cars with illegal software. The system that failed was the software used in Volkswagen cars to cheat emissions regulations. The cause of the failure was the deliberate concealment of risks by Volkswagen when selling corporate debt to American investors. The impact of the failure was significant, leading to legal battles, settlement agreements, and damage to Volkswagen's reputation. Volkswagen was responsible for the failure as they were manufacturing and selling the cars with illegal software. The impacted entities include American investors who purchased the corporate debt and Volkswagen itself, facing legal consequences and a need to reform its corporate culture. [262]

2023-10-03 17:03:36,603 INFO: In this incident, a software failure occurred during a chat session organized by a society that had contracted with Convey Services, a software company. The failure happened when the chat filter algorithm provided by a third party, Arena.im, mistakenly marked innocent words like "bone" as offensive and replaced them with asterisks. This caused participants to discover other words triggering the filter and resulted in the creation of a meme about the incident. The failure was noticed by participants, who alerted the society's leaders. The impact of the failure was embarrassment and frustration for the participants who were unable to communicate properly. Convey Services, the software company responsible for the chat session, removed the offensive words quickly, but they were surprised by the existence of innocuous words triggering the algorithm. It was their responsibility to ensure the system worked effectively. [190]

2023-10-03 17:04:11,051 INFO: The software failure incident occurred during the World Series of Poker (W.S.O.P.) online poker tournaments in July. The W.S.O.P.'s software, which was used for the tournaments, experienced glitches that affected multiple players. One player, unable to place bets despite having good cards, watched as her digital stack decreased. Another professional player, Daniel Negreanu, was so frustrated with the glitchy software that he picked up his laptop and left. The cause of the failure is not specified in the given context. The impact of the failure was that players were unable to properly participate and make bets, resulting in frustration and potential monetary loss. The responsible entity for the software failure is the W.S.O.P. The impacted entity is the players participating in the online poker tournaments. [328]

2023-10-03 17:05:12,171 INFO: In the summer of 2017, the video game Breakaway, developed by Amazon, experienced a software failure. Despite years of effort, Amazon had failed to produce a successful big-name title. The failure was caused by a combination of ambitious deadlines, Amazon's focus on data and documents over creativity, and the clash of corporate ideologies within the company. The impact of the failure was felt by the underpaid artists, coders, designers, sound engineers, marketers, writers, and producers who had worked on the game. Amazon, as the responsible entity, faced the consequences of their inability to excel in the gaming industry. The failure showcased the unpredictability of success in the gaming world, where even large studios and companies like Activision-Blizzards, Biowares, and Rockstars can experience failures. [137]

2023-10-03 17:05:48,054 INFO: In this software failure incident, a ransomware attack was discovered on Android devices. The failure occurred when the ransomware's manifest file, which should list all software components, was found to have aberrations that indicated malware. The ransomware developers encrypted code for numerous parts of the manifest file and hid it in a different folder to make it harder to assess. The impact of this failure was that the ransomware could still run but wouldn't immediately reveal its malicious intent. Additionally, researchers discovered a machine learning module within the malware that could size and zoom the ransom note based on the victim's device display, although it was not activated in this instance. The ransomware was designed to mask its functions and purpose to evade detection by security systems. The responsible entity for the failure is the group of ransomware attackers, who primarily distribute the ransomware through online forums and random web pages. The impacted entity is the users of Android devices who were targeted by the ransomware attack. [166]

2023-10-03 17:06:49,170 INFO: The software failure incident occurred on the first day of classes in Virginia Beach, when students and teachers were unable to log in due to an issue with the cloud-based web filter that monitors students' online activity. The service was restored before noon, but similar problems were reported in other districts on the East Coast. Additionally, the district had to delay the first day of school as it was discovered that cyberattackers had targeted some of the city's servers with ransomware, including the one managing school bus routes. This incident left nearly 18,000 students in limbo. In Miami-Dade County, online classes were also severely affected by glitches for days due to cyberattacks, leading to the arrest of a 16-year-old student in connection with the attacks. These software failures have exacerbated the frustration caused by challenges and have widened student achievement gaps by race and income. The responsible entity for the cyberattacks and glitches was not specified. The impacted entity includes the districts of Virginia Beach, Miami-Dade County, and potentially other districts on the East Coast. [263]

2023-10-03 17:07:22,519 INFO: In August of 2017, a software failure incident occurred at the Petro Rabigh oil refinery in Saudi Arabia. The incident involved a malware known as Triton or Trisis, which was specifically designed to disable safety systems in the plant. This failure was intended to sabotage the refinery's safety devices and potentially lead to leaks or explosions. The cause of the failure was a cyberattack carried out by mysterious hackers. The impact of the failure was significant as it triggered a failsafe mechanism that shut down the entire Rabigh plant. The responsible entity for the cyberattack was revealed to be Russia's Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics. The incident resulted in the imposition of sanctions on the Russian organization by the US Treasury, cutting off their business relations with the US. [164]

2023-10-03 17:07:54,699 INFO: The software failure incident occurred when the Love Bug virus was released, which was around 20 years ago. The system that failed was Windows 95, which had a bug that allowed the virus code to be executed on infected computers. The cause of the failure was a malicious individual named De Guzman who designed the virus to spread through email attachments. The impact of the failure was significant, with damage estimates reaching billions of dollars as infected computers had to be fixed and protected from reinfection. The responsible entity for the virus was De Guzman, who created and released it. The impacted entities were individuals who clicked on the infected email attachments, causing the virus to spread rapidly across networks and affect numerous systems, including the Pentagon. [271]
