2023-04-19 04:05:09,854 INFO: Article ID: 78 ; SEcauses: The article states that Volkswagen admitted to installing "defeat devices" in more than 11 million diesel vehicles so that their engines temporarily ran cleaner when being tested for pollution. The illegal software was installed in 11 million diesel vehicles and allowed them to cheat on emissions tests.
2023-04-19 04:05:09,854 INFO: Article ID: 52 ; SEcauses: The article states that Volkswagen admitted that about 11 million of its diesel vehicles contained special software designed to deceive emissions tests. The software was used to cheat on emissions tests by producing artificially low emissions levels when tested, but then turning off those controls during actual driving, resulting in emissions of nitrogen oxide up to 40 times the allowable level in the United States. This is referred to as a emissions-cheating scandal.
2023-04-19 04:05:09,855 INFO: Article ID: 19 ; SEcauses: According to the article, Volkswagen admitted to installing special software in millions of cars in the United States and Europe designed to deceive emissions-testing procedures. This illegal diesel software was installed in VW, Audi and Porsche models using several engine designs, and the evasion had reportedly begun in 2005. VW has blamed a small group of engineers for the misconduct, but some critics argue that the scale of the problem suggests the involvement of separate engineering teams.
2023-04-19 04:05:10,756 INFO: Theme and Cluster 1 : The descriptions all involve software-related problems or errors.
2023-04-19 04:05:10,759 INFO: Article ID: 1 ; SEcauses: According to Bloomberg, the problem was caused by "a combination of hardware and software failures," accompanied by failure in the company's "multiple redundant systems." The article does not provide further details about the specific software causes of the incident.
2023-04-19 04:05:10,759 INFO: Article ID: 8 ; SEcauses: Boeing discovered a software error that could result in a total loss of power. The problem had occurred only in lab simulation and no airplane had experienced it. Boeing found that if the four engine generators were left on continuously for about eight months, a software internal counter would overflow and cause the control units to enter a fail-safe mode. The F.A.A. warned that this could result in a loss of all electrical power, regardless of whether the plane was in flight.
2023-04-19 04:05:10,759 INFO: Article ID: 26 ; SEcauses: The article describes multiple software issues that could cause incidents, ranging from simple software bugs to poorly installed encryption or even no encryption at all in systems incorporated into smart cities. These issues leave them wide open to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack which can lead to traffic light malfunction or other harmful consequences. The article does not describe a specific incident caused by these software issues.

2023-04-19 04:12:08,360 INFO: Article ID: 1 ; SEcauses: According to Bloomberg, the problem was caused by "a combination of hardware and software failures," accompanied by failure in the company's "multiple redundant systems." The article does not provide further details about the specific software causes of the incident.
2023-04-19 04:12:08,360 INFO: Article ID: 30 ; SEcauses: The article does not provide specific information on the software causes of the incident. It mentions general problems with the technology and design of automated parking garages, including errors in parking and delivering cars, malfunctioning machinery, and delays in retrieving vehicles. It also suggests that some garage builders tried to duplicate foreign successes without understanding the differences in design. The article notes that drivers were unaccustomed to technology, which may indicate a lack of user training or feedback systems. Overall, the article focuses more on the broader challenges and failures of automated parking technology than on specific software causes of the incident.
2023-04-19 04:12:08,360 INFO: Article ID: 26 ; SEcauses: The article describes multiple software issues that could cause incidents, ranging from simple software bugs to poorly installed encryption or even no encryption at all in systems incorporated into smart cities. These issues leave them wide open to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack which can lead to traffic light malfunction or other harmful consequences. The article does not describe a specific incident caused by these software issues.

2023-04-19 04:12:09,453 INFO: Article ID: 78 ; SEcauses: The article states that Volkswagen admitted to installing "defeat devices" in more than 11 million diesel vehicles so that their engines temporarily ran cleaner when being tested for pollution. The illegal software was installed in 11 million diesel vehicles and allowed them to cheat on emissions tests.
2023-04-19 04:12:09,453 INFO: Article ID: 52 ; SEcauses: The article states that Volkswagen admitted that about 11 million of its diesel vehicles contained special software designed to deceive emissions tests. The software was used to cheat on emissions tests by producing artificially low emissions levels when tested, but then turning off those controls during actual driving, resulting in emissions of nitrogen oxide up to 40 times the allowable level in the United States. This is referred to as a emissions-cheating scandal.
2023-04-19 04:12:09,453 INFO: Article ID: 19 ; SEcauses: According to the article, Volkswagen admitted to installing special software in millions of cars in the United States and Europe designed to deceive emissions-testing procedures. This illegal diesel software was installed in VW, Audi and Porsche models using several engine designs, and the evasion had reportedly begun in 2005. VW has blamed a small group of engineers for the misconduct, but some critics argue that the scale of the problem suggests the involvement of separate engineering teams.
